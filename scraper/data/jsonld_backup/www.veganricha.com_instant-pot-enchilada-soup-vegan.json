Vegan Richa Recipes","description":"Instant Pot Vegan Enchilada Soup with Quinoa, walnuts, mushrooms. \nFULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2018/11/instant-pot-enchilada-soup-vegan.html\nMY BOOKS: https://veganricha.com/books \n\nThis Pressure Cooker Bean-free \"chikin\" Enchilada Soup  has Homemade enchilada seasoning. Omit soycurls for soyfree and add more quinoa. Add some beans or chickpeas for a hearty Vegan Quinoa chili. \n\nSaucepan Option on the post. Vegan  Glutenfree Recipe. Soyfree Nutfree Oilfree option\n\nQuinoa, mushrooms, walnuts, optional soy curls or beans/lentils all go into a pressure cooker with some enchilada seasoning, which is a dry enchilada sauce mix with various spices and chilies. Add some broth/stock and done! The quinoa and walnut add amazing texture to this thick soup which is more like a enchilada filling. You can use it to fill up burritos and top nachos too. If you add a bit more broth and some cooked beans, it makes a great Quinoa chili! Serve with toppings of choice.\n\n\nMusic by Lakey Inspired \n\nsoundcloud.com/lakeyinspired","uploadDate":"2019-02-02T19:28:29+00:00","duration":"PT1M27S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Arxx7N1OOPo/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Arxx7N1OOPo","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Arxx7N1OOPo?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["4","4 servings"],"prepTime":"PT5M","cookTime":"PT20M","totalTime":"PT25M","recipeIngredient":["1 tsp oil (, Or use 3 tbsp broth to saute)","1/2  medium onion (, chopped)","4 cloves of garlic (, finely chopped)","6 oz mushrooms (, a combination or white, cremini or other))","1/3 cup walnuts","1/2 - 1  jalapeno chopped","1  green bell pepper (, chopped)","1/2  red bell pepper chopped","2 tbsp or more enchilada seasoning ((see below))","1/4 cup dry quinoa","2 oz soy curls ((optional))","1/3 cup corn","1 cup tomato sauce or puree","1.5 cups veggie broth or vegan chikin flavored broth or water","3/4 tsp salt ((slightly less if the broth is salted))","1/2 tsp each of chipotle pepper powder (, ancho chili powder, cumin, oregano, chipotle pepper flakes, garlic powder, onion powder.)","3/4 tsp  smoked paprika (or a mix of sweet &amp; smoked, as all smoked can be hot)","1/4 tsp cinnamon","dashes of black pepper (cayenne, thyme (optional))"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Start the instant pot on sauté.
