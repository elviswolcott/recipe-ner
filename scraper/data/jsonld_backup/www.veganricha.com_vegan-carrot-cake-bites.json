No Refined Sugar \nFULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2019/03/vegan-carrot-cake-bites.html\nMY BOOKS: https://veganricha.com/books\n\nThese Spiced Carrot Cake Balls Need just 8 ingredients and 15 minutes. No refined sugar or oil. Roll in coconut or dress with vegan cream cheese glaze. Vegan Glutenfree Grainfree Soyfree Raw option.\n\nThe carrots in these balls are roasted for a bit to enhance the flavor, they get sweet and add a baked cake like profile. The carrots then get processed with the rest of the ingredients to make a dough that is shaped into balls or bars. Even with the baking, it takes just 15 mins of active time! Walnuts, spices, dates and coconut flour make these a fudgy spiced delicious treat. These would be no bake if you use raw carrots. \n\nThese Carrot Cake Energy Bites are Easy, taste like carrot cake, are grainfree, oilfree, are naturally sweetened and are ready within minutes! Lets make some.\n\n***************************************************\nHi, I'm Richa! I create flavorful creative recipes that might need a tiny bit more work, but are totally worth it!
