Served with Date Sweetened Peanut Butter Dipping Sauce. Fresh Spring Rolls/ Rice paper rolls in a bowl. Make a bowl, wrap or fill up rice paper wrappers. Vegan Gluten-free Recipe. No Refined Sugar or Oil.\n\nI love fresh Vietnamese Spring Rolls. The fresh veggies, mint, cilantro, peanut sauce or sweet and spicy dipping sauce. Everything just works so well together. When I want some refreshing crunchy veggie fresh rolls with the crunch, lettuce, carrots, cucumbers, mint, cilantro, tofu, noodles and a fabulous dipping sauce but don’t want to roll things up, I make it into a deconstructed Summer Roll Bowl!\n\nPrep the veggies and the noodles, marinate and bake the tofu, meanwhile blend up the Peanut sauce that is sweetened with dates. No refined Sugar or Oil in this Bowl! Assemble into bowl, rolls, wrap or however you like and serve.\n\n******MORE AMAZING BOWLS FROM THE BLOG******\n\nPEANUT BUTTER CAULIFLOWER BOWL WITH ROASTED CARROTS: https://www.veganricha.com/peanut-butter-cauliflower-bowl-with-roasted-carrots/\n\nJALAPENO POPPER DIP & HAVARTI DIP: https://www.veganricha.com/jalapeno-popper-dip-vegan-glutenfree/\n\nCAJUN ROASTED VEGETABLE BOWL WITH GARLIC SAUCE: https://www.veganricha.com/cajun-roasted-vegetable-bowl-with-garlic-sauce/\n\nCURRIED KIDNEY BEANS, QUINOA, ROASTED ZUCCHINI, MANGO SALSA BOWL: https://www.veganricha.com/curried-kidney-beans-quinoa-roasted-zucchini-mango-salsa-bowl/\n\nQUINOA CAULIFLOWER BOWL WITH ALMOND SRIRACHA SAUCE: https://www.veganricha.com/quinoa-cauliflower-collard-bowl-with/\n\nCOOKBOOKS BY RICHA HINGLE (VEGAN RICHA): https://www.veganricha.com/mybooks/\n\nConnect with me on Social Media:\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\n\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/veganricha\n\nPINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/veganricha\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound \n\n#deconstructedsummerrolls #veganbowls #summerrollsrecipe #veganricha #easyveganreecipes","uploadDate":"2021-01-14T23:54:47+00:00","duration":"PT1M44S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fK6KdCxwpao/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fK6KdCxwpao","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fK6KdCxwpao?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["3"],"prepTime":"PT15M","cookTime":"PT25M","totalTime":"PT40M","recipeIngredient":["12 to 14 oz firm Tofu (pressed for atleast 10 mins to remove excess moisture.)","2 tbsp soy sauce (or use tamari for glutenfree)","1/2 tsp garlic powder","1/4 tsp ginger powder","1/4 cup peanut butter","6 to 7  dates (pitted)","2 to 2.5 tbsp lime juice","2 tsp soy sauce","2 tsp minced ginger","6 oz Vermicelli or Maifun Rice noodles (cooked according to instruction on the package)","2 to 3 cups chopped lettuce","julienned or thinly sliced carrots","peeled and sliced cucumber","1 cup mint leaves","1 cup packed cilantro"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Slice everything as needed.
