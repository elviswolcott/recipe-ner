There is a triple moisture action going on here. Yeast rising slowly with just a bit of flour, the sweet potato, and then another rise. All of these together allow for amazing moisture retention in the bread. And to top it all, you donâ€™t even need to knead it much! Just mix to bring everything together into a somewhat dough and everything will work out!\n\nYou can use Pumpkin puree, butternut puree or Mashed Potatoes(thin them slightly with non dairy milk for soft white dinner rolls), in these rolls. Super versatile and delicious as is. For sweeter rolls, omit the herbs and add some sugar/sweetener. These are lightly herbed and lightly savory just like regular dinner rolls. \n\n\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ BUY MY COOKBOOK: http://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen \nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ Join the Mailing List: https://veganricha.com/mailinglist\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ SUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\nâœ¦ JOIN THE COMMUNITY:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nâœ¦ COOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book:\nhttp://www.veganricha.com/vrekaz\nMy Amazon Store: https://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\n\n#veganricha #easyveganrecipes #vegan #veganism #veganrecipes #cooking","uploadDate":"2018-11-21T19:02:53+00:00","duration":"PT1M44S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8UI-aolbftY/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UI-aolbftY","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8UI-aolbftY?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["10","10 rolls"],"prepTime":"PT10M","cookTime":"PT20M","totalTime":"PT30M","recipeIngredient":["3/4 cup non dairy milk ((warmed to just about warm to touch))","2 tsp active yeast","3/4 cup sweet potato puree ((canned or boiled, steamed sweet potato that has been mashed/pureed well))","2 tbsp oil ((optional), see tips section for no oil)","3 cups of flour","3/4 to 1 tsp salt","1 to 2 tbsp dried herbsÂ  ((thyme, rosemary, chives or a combination, or 2 tbsp fresh herbs))","Oil ((or vegan butter for brushing))"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Mix the yeast and warmed non dairy milk and let sit for 5 mins","name":"Mix the yeast and warmed non dairy milk and let sit for 5 mins","url":"https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-sweet-potato-rolls/#wprm-recipe-29818-step-0-0"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Add the sweet potato puree and 1/2 cup of flour and mix in, whisk until no lumps.&nbsp;Cover and let sit for at least 30 mins.","name":"Add the sweet potato puree and 1/2 cup of flour and mix in, whisk until no lumps.&nbsp;Cover and let sit for at least 30 mins.","url":"https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-sweet-potato-rolls/#wprm-recipe-29818-step-0-1"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Add oil, 2 cups of flour*, salt and herbs.
