This vegan potato soup is medicine for the soul. Super easy, hugely delicious and so filling you can have it as a main course. It’s amazing fresh but it’s even better the next day.

I like to top it with some\nSmoky tofu bacony bits. \n\nLaura says: \"Ok I was skeptical but this was the best potato soup I have tried.
