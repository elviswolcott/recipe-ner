Use the batter to make pancakes, crepes, crustless quiche. Vegan Glutenfree Soyfree Recipe. Nutfree option.\nThis filling, savory vegetable frittata from is made with chickpea flour, and vegetables and no Tofu! The batter is very versatile and pairs well with any vegetables or greens. The batter also makes quick pancakes to serve with a variety of sauces.\n\nKala Namak (Indian sulphur salt) adds the eggy flavor to this frittata.

Serve it with some sriracha or your favorite sauce.
