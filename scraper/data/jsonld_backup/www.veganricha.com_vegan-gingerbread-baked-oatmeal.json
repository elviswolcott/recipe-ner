Moist gingerbread oat bars, 1 Bowl\nFULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2019/12/vegan-gingerbread-baked-oatmeal.html\n\nOats tossed with gingerbread spices, molasses, candied ginger and non dairy milk and baked to make moist gingerbread oat bars!\nThese past few months can be labelled as the baked oatmeal months on the blog. Since I started making baled oatmeal, I’ve fallen in love with the texture and love to play around with the flavor options. Be it PB&J baked oatmeal, Pumpkin Baked Oatmeal or Banana Bread Baked Oatmeal.\n\nJust 10 everyday ingredients, No added Oil, no added refined sugar(omit candied ginger) and takes just 10 minutes to put together. Bake, slice and serve warm or cold! No gummy Oatmeal! Its fluffy and just the right amount of soft. Top the oatmeal with nuts or spices, and serve with maple syrup or whipped coconut cream.\n\nMy Books: https://veganricha.com/books\n#easyveganrecipes #veganricha #veganbreakfastt #bakedoatmeal #gingerebreadbakedoatmeal","uploadDate":"2020-01-03T00:26:26+00:00","duration":"PT1M10S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7ua8eTiR6P0/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ua8eTiR6P0","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7ua8eTiR6P0?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["6"],"prepTime":"PT10M","cookTime":"PT35M","totalTime":"PT45M","recipeIngredient":["2 cups old fashioned oats (,use certified gluten-free if needed, see notes for substitution)","1 tsp baking powder","1.5 tsp gingerbread spice (or 1 tsp gingerbread spice + 1/2 tsp cinnamon)","1/4 tsp salt","3 tbsp chopped pecans or walnuts (, or omit for nutfree)","1 tbsp coconut","3 tbsp chopped candied ginger","1 tbsp chia seeds","3 tbsp light molasses ((or 2 tbsp dark molasses))","3 tbsp maple syrup","1 cup  warm non dairy milk such as coconut or almond","1/4 cup applesauce","optional add ins: chopped dates (,chocolate chips, dried fruit)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Mix all the dry ingredients from oats to chia seeds in a baking dish(9 by 9 inch or 8 by 10 inch or similar).
