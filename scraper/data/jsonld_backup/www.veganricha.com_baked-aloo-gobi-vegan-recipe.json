Spiced, perfectly cooked bites of potato and cauliflower, often served along with dals, curries. Aloo gobi is made almost exactly the same way at my mom’s since forever. No one wants to mess with perfection! Everyday Aloo Gobi is a seasoned veggie side kind of dish. It is dryish and not saucy. Restaurants usually make a saucy version. Try this one for saucy aloo gobi https://www.veganricha.com/2017/08/instant-pot-aloo-gobi-curried-potato-cauliflower.html\n\nBack to our fave Punjabi Aloo gobi. I kept the flavors and ingredients and changed up the cooking in the skillet to baking and voila. The process is much easier and needs less active time, as you don’t need to be in standing the kitchen.\n\nAlso the baked aloo gobi turns out fabulously flavored, perfectly cooked and no mushy Cauliflower! Aloo Gobi in my house has got to be dry evenly spiced side without a sauce. Its wet enough from the moisture in the veggies. Just a few ingredients and gorgeous golden veggies is what we are aiming for.  You can change up the spices to preference. For less roasted crisp, just use a smaller baking dish so they are spread almost double layer. Believe me, you wont go back to the skillet or Instant pot for aloo gobi once you try this Roasted Aloo Gobi! \n\nSame Amazing Indian flavor and excellent texture.
