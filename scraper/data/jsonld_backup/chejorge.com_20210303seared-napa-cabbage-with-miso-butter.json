Start by washing the cabbage thoroughly. Note: Most of the dirt is between the outer leaves. I usually just peel them back slightly to wash, but you can also simply remove the few outermost leaves. Tie butcher's twine around the cabbage to secure the leaves, spacing each knot about 5 cm (2 inches) away from each other. Then cut the cabbage into circular 'steaks' by slicing in the middle between each knot. For each cabbage 'steak,' secure the leaves across the diameter with 3-4 more strings. Note: make sure to use extra strings to secure the leaves (especially the ones in the center). This not only helps develop a more even sear, but makes sure the 'steaks' don't fall apart when you try to flip it.","text":"Prepare Napa Cabbage. Start by washing the cabbage thoroughly.

Preheat the oven to 420 F (215 C). Make sure your kitchen's ventilation is good here. Heat a cast iron skillet over high heat. Once it starts smoking, add about 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil and follow with the cabbage 'steak.' Note: each 'steak' will have a side with larger diameter due to the natural curvature of the cabbage. I usually sear the cabbage with the wide side down first, so the leaves won't come apart when they slightly shrink from cooking. For the first side, you want to sear until it is so deeply charred that you're afraid it is burnt, about 4-5 minutes. Carefully flip the cabbage and continue searing for about 2 minutes, then immediately transfer the skillet into the oven to roast for 5 minutes.","text":"Sear the Cabbage.
