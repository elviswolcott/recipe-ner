Heat up peanut oil (or vegetable oil) in a non-stick pan or wok on medium-high heat. Note: This may seem like a lot of oil but it is crucial if you don't want the noodles to stick! First, fry the garlic, shallots, and dried chili peppers until aromatic, about 2 minutes. Then, add the brown sugar (or cane sugar) along with fried tofu cubes, and cook until the sugar caramelizes, around 1-2 minutes. Add in the prepared sauce, followed by rice noodles. Stir very well to combine, and make sure the rice noodles don't stick together.","text":"Make the Pad Thai. Heat up peanut oil (or vegetable oil) in a non-stick pan or wok on medium-high heat.
