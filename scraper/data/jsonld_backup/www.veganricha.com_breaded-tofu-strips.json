Marinated Tofu breaded and grilled or baked. Flavorful and easy. Vegan Breaded Tofu, Holiday Recipe. Can be made gluten-free with glutenfree bread crumbs. Easily doubled.\n\nThis easy crisped up tofu needs just a few minutes of active time. Brush the marinade on the Tofu strips and let it sit for a while, then bread and grill. Serve as side or main with a side of salad or pilaf.  The ketchup, spices, soy sauce make a great marinade, which also acts like a sticky coat to keep all those breadcrumbs on. Use other sauces like bbq, and spices and herbs of choice. \n\n******MORE TOFU RECIPES FROM THE BLOG******\n\nSPICY VEGAN ORANGE TOFU AND PEPPERS: https://www.veganricha.com/spicy-orange-tofu-and-peppers-vegan/\n\nPALAK TOFU PANEER: https://www.veganricha.com/palak-tofu-tofu-in-spinach-curry-vegan/\n\nPEANUT BUTTER TOFU BOWL WITH MASHED POTATOES: https://www.veganricha.com/peanut-butter-tofu-bowl/\n\nCOOKBOOKS BY RICHA HINGLE (VEGAN RICHA): https://www.veganricha.com/mybooks/\n\nConnect with me on Social Media:\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\n\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/veganricha\n\nPINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/veganricha\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound \n\n#breadedtofu #tofurecipe #veganricha #easyveganreecipes","uploadDate":"2021-05-12T21:46:52+00:00","duration":"PT1M7S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kzAvxJMYxvU/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzAvxJMYxvU","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kzAvxJMYxvU?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["6"],"prepTime":"PT60M","cookTime":"PT30M","totalTime":"PT90M","recipeIngredient":["14 oz extra firm or firm tofu pressed ((I usually use Nasoya Organic non gmo))","1 tbsp low sodium tamari/soy sauce","2 tbsp ketchup","1 tsp maple syrup or other sweetener","1/2 tsp hot sauce (optional)","2 tsp oil","1/2 tsp garam masala (or 1/2 tsp ground cumin and 1/2 tsp ground coriander)","1/2 tsp garlic","1/4 tsp salt","1/2  tsp cornstarch or tapioca starch ((optional, helps the breadcrumbs stick better during grilling))","3/4 cup breadcrumbs (, use gluten-free crumbs to make gf)","1/4 tsp salt","1/4 to 1/2 tsp cayenne","1 tbsp nutritional yeast (optional)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Slice the slab into 6 to 8 rectangles.
