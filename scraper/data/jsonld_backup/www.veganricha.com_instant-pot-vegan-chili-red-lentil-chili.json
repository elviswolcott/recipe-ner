A hearty Chili with lentils, veggies and beans is a perfect 1 Pot meal. \n\nThis chili has veggies, quick cooking Red lentils and Kidney beans. The lentils add a great texture and also thicken the chili really well. Add whichever beans you like to make up the bulk. I like to use chipotle and ancho chilies for flavor. Use dry or canned chipotle pepper to preference.Â \nThis chili is Simple, hearty, thick, quick and Delicious.Â See Saucepan Option on the post. \nMore Instant Pot Recipes: \nhttp://veganricha.com/category/instant-pot\n\n\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ BUY MY COOKBOOK: http://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen \nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ Join the Mailing List: https://veganricha.com/mailinglist\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ SUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\nâœ¦ JOIN THE COMMUNITY:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nâœ¦ COOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book:\nhttp://www.veganricha.com/vrekaz\nMy Amazon Store: https://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\n\n#vegan #veganism #easyveganrecipes #veganrecipes #veganricha #cooking \nMusic: Peyruis Swing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4Aq9qtQcFo","uploadDate":"2018-07-17T00:42:15+00:00","duration":"PT1M26S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NVlpxW32iOM/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVlpxW32iOM","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NVlpxW32iOM?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["3"],"prepTime":"PT10M","cookTime":"PT25M","totalTime":"PT35M","recipeIngredient":["1/4 cup water or broth","1/2  onion chopped","4 cloves of garlic (chopped)","1  jalapeno or 1/4 cup chopped green bell pepper","1 cup chopped celery","1/2 cup chopped carrots","1/2  red bell pepper or green bell pepper (chopped)","15 oz can kidney beans or 1.5 cups cooked (, or use black beans)","1/2 cup dry red lentils (quick cooking lentils (masoor dal))","2 tsp ground cumin or a combination of cumin and coriander","1 to 2 tsp paprika (I use a combination of smoked paprika and sweet)","1 tsp oregano","1/2 tsp chipotle chili flakes or powder ( or ancho chili powder)","1 to 2 tsp chili powder blend (chili blend not pure chili powder, optional)","1/2 tsp each garlic powder and onion powder","1  bay leaf optional","28 oz diced tomato (with juices)","1 to 2 tbsp tomato paste","3/4 tsp salt ((less if using salted broth and beans))","1.5 cups water ( or veggie broth )","lemon juice to taste (, cayenne or black pepper for heat)","1/4 cup cilantro","avocado (, hot sauce, vegan sour cream, chopped onion, tortilla strips, other toppings)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Add water or broth to the instant Pot on Saute when hot.
