They are vegan gluten-free grain-free nut-free soy-free and oil-free! \n\nThis year I have been experimenting a lot with tahini and grain-free baking! So here’s another tahini cookie which is mostly just tahini. The key to liking tahini is getting a good brand that is not too bitter. I love cookies which are scoop and bake, no hand messyness! These cookies bake into fat soft cookies. You can lave them like that or flatten with a spoon and continue to bake for crispy chewy cookies.\n\nFor these cookies, get a good brand of tahini such as Soom or Whole foods brand, add a lot more spice to mask some of the bitterness, adjust baking time for the kind of texture you prefer, a few mins longer for crispier and and get to a cookie you love! Don’t like tahini, just use smooth nut butter or sunbutter or use a a mix of tahini and nut butter.\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\n#veganricha #easyveganreecipes #tahinicookies #vegancookies #grainfree","uploadDate":"2020-01-14T03:58:45+00:00","duration":"PT1M51S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MawFMUbkHeI/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MawFMUbkHeI","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MawFMUbkHeI?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["12"],"prepTime":"PT10M","cookTime":"PT25M","totalTime":"PT35M","recipeIngredient":["1.5 tbsp flax seed meal","1/4 cup water","3/4 cup tahini","3 tbsp sugar (such as coconut sugar or cane sugar)","3 tbsp maple syrup","1/2 tsp baking powder","1/4 tsp baking soda","1.5 tsp  chai spice blend","2 - 3 tbsp coconut flour"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Mix flax seed meal and water and set aside for 2 mins to make the flac&quot;egg&quot;.
