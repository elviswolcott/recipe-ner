Most machines take 10 to 15 minutes depending on the temperature of the mix, and it should look like soft serve when it’s finished. Transfer the churned ice cream to a large freezer-safe container. Wide and shallow containers work well for mixing, freezing, and scooping later on. Gently fold the crumbled oats into the base until they’re evenly distributed. You want to be sure to maintain the air that was churned into the base for the best texture. Smooth the top, cover the container, and freeze the ice cream for at least 5 to 6 hours, or until it is set.
