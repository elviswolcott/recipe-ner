Golden Milk Mix + Chai Spice. Caffeine-free.\nFULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2019/05/golden-chai-mix-for-turmeric-chai-latte.html\nMY BOOKS: https://veganricha.com/books\n\nI’ve been trying to change up my morning Chai to be caffeine free. Don’t ask me how that is going (it is hard!). I’ve been reducing the masala Chai and subbing a portion of it other options. This cup of this Turmeric Chai works the best. The warm spiced drink feels cozy and the refreshing spices remind me of the brewed spiced masala chai. Success!\n\nMy favorite Indian Chai spice mix gets a makeover with the addition of Turmeric and some optional saffron. This potent and flavorful mix makes amazing golden chai latte, minus the chai(tea, caffeine). Mix up this golden chai mix, change up the amounts of spices to preference. Boil in a small amount of non dairy milk then add some frothed non dairy milk and done!\n\nYou can add a tea bag to it for tea, serve it cold over ice or make a golden ice cream shake or smoothie! You can also use this mix in dals, veggie stir and curries! Try it in my peanut butter chickpea curry, lentil soup, and aloo gobi.
