Saucepan option.\nFULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2018/02/instant-pot-lasagna-soup-vegan.html\n\nVegan Lasagna Soup with lasagna noodles, veggies, red lentils and basil. 1 Pot weekday meal. Vegan Nut-free Recipe. Saucepan option Can be gluten-free. Serve with pesto, vegan ricotta or garlic bread.\n\n\nThis soup is satisfying and comfort food made in 1 pot and ready within minutes. It comes together quickly with short active time. Make it in the Instant Pot (pressure cooker) or a Saucepan (see recipe notes on post), but definitely make it. I love the soup with some extra garlicky topping like garlic bread or garlic olive oil and some fresh basil or pesto. Lentils make up the protein. If using brown lentils, use cooked lentils. Veggie crumbles will also work wonderfully.\n\n\nBUY MY COOKBOOK: http://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen \n\nMY AMAZON STORE: https://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha\n\nSUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n#vegan #veganism #easyveganrecipes #veganrecipes #veganricha #cooking \n✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧\nFOLLOW US:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nCOOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book:\nhttp://www.veganricha.com/vrekaz\n\n✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧\n\nMusic: Me too by Lakey inspired \nhttps://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired/","uploadDate":"2018-02-18T15:00:00+00:00","duration":"PT2M3S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1LL37S4BF7Q/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LL37S4BF7Q","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1LL37S4BF7Q?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["3"],"prepTime":"PT10M","cookTime":"PT20M","totalTime":"PT30M","recipeIngredient":["1 tsp oil","1/2  onion (chopped)","4 cloves of garlic (chopped)","1 cup veggies - combination of peppers (, carrots, zucchini)","1/4 cup red lentils ((uncooked) - quick cooking red lentils (split ones) also called masoor dal)","1 cup tomato puree ((or use any thick tomato sauce such as marinara, pasta sauce or passata))","1 to 1.5 cup diced tomato","2 tsp italian seasoning ((1 tsp basil and 1/2 tsp oregano, parsley, generous dash of thyme/sage and rosemary))","1/4 tsp each onion powder (, garlic powder)","1/2 to 3/4 tsp salt ((depends on if there is salt in the tomatoes or other seasoning, I use 3/4 tsp with))","2 cups water or veggie broth ((2.5 to 3 cups for soupier or if using whole grain noodles or with more veggies))","5 oz lasagna sheets (, broken into small pieces, or use pasta of choice (I use no boil as they work out the best))","dash of black and white pepper","pepper flakes to taste (, i use about 1/3 tsp)","1 tbsp nutritional yeast","1 cup packed spinach (, optional)","vegan pesto, vegan ricotta or mozzarella, vegan butter/ garlic bread to serve (optional)","a tbsp tomato paste, lemon, fennel seeds (optional add ins)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Heat oil in Instant pot on saute mode.
