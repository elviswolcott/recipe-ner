In a microwave-safe bowl, combine 1 cup (160 grams) of sweet rice flour (mochiko) and 50 grams of sugar. Whisk to combine first, then add 1 cup (236 grams) of water and whisk until completely smooth. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, poke a few holes on top, and microwave on high heat for 1 minute. After 1 minute, use a wet spatula to mix up the dough. Repeat this two times with 1 more minute, then 30 more seconds (2 minutes 30 seconds total). Turn the dough onto a work surface that's been lined with parchment paper and heavily dusted with potato starch (or corn starch), and let cool for a little bit.","text":"Make the Mochi Dough.

Dust both the top of the mochi dough and the rolling pin liberally with flour, and roll the dough out into a large rectangle.

Note: Before wrapping mochi, be sure to have plastic wrap ready on the side. Dust off as much potato starch as possible with a pastry brush, then place a scoop right in the middle. Fold up the sides, stretching as necessary, until the ice cream is completely encased. (I place the remaining scoops back into the freezer while I wrap each one up). Then, quickly wrap up the mochi ice cream and twist the top relatively tight, and place it back into the muffin cup/egg carton to keep its shape.","text":"Wrap the Ice Cream.
