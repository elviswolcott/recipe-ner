Atakilt Wat. 1 Pot , 30 Mins\nFULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2014/07/atakilt-wat-ethiopian-cabbage-potato.html\n\nAtakilt Wat/ Atkilt wot is a Ethiopian cabbage dish. The traditional recipe may or may not use some niter kibeh which is butter/ghee slow-infused with whole spices like cardamom, cinnamon, fenugreek, cloves, ginger, garlic etc. by cooking everything on low heat for hours. You can make niter qibe/ kibeh with coconut or olive oil(see my Second book Everyday Kitchen for a recipe) and use about a Tbsp of the Spiced oil in this recipe instead of all the spices and oil. \nSince I don't usually have the infused oil, I sometimes add the spices directly to infuse the oil while cooking (Indian style) for my interpretation of this delicious Atakilt Wat. Omit the spices to preference. Serve with Ethiopian flat breads or other flat breads and lentil stews. Easy and So Flavorful!\n\nMore Ethiopian Inspired Recipes including Berbere Spiced Jackfruit, Kik Alicha and more here: https://www.veganricha.com/?s=ethiopian\n\nBUY MY COOKBOOK: http://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen \n\nSUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n#vegan #veganism #easyveganrecipes #veganrecipes #veganricha #cooking \n✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧\nFOLLOW US:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nCOOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book:\nhttp://www.veganricha.com/vrekaz\n\nVR AMAZON STORE:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha\n✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧\n\nMusic: Rock Angel by Joakim Karud\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8eRXvLL7Wo","uploadDate":"2018-01-21T20:01:33+00:00","duration":"PT1M16S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KHU9nUHqAdk/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHU9nUHqAdk","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KHU9nUHqAdk?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["2"],"prepTime":"PT15M","cookTime":"PT35M","totalTime":"PT50M","recipeIngredient":["2 tsp olive oil or vegan butter (divided)","2 cloves garlic (minced)","1 tsp minced ginger","1  green chili (chopped (optional))","1/2 cup chopped onion","1/4 tsp cumin powder","1/2 to 3/4 tsp turmeric powder","1/4 tsp fenugreek seeds or powder","1/4 tsp cardamom powder","1/4 tsp cinnamon powder","1/8 tsp cloves powder","a generous dash of black pepper","3/4 cup sliced carrots","2  medium potatoes (chopped, 1.5 loaded cups)","1/2  head of cabbage (finely chopped)","1/2 tsp salt"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"In a large skillet, add 1 tsp oil and heat at medium-low.
