Stove top option. Nutfree option\nðŸ’™ FULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2018/09/vegan-cauliflower-tikka-masala.html\nðŸ’™ COOKBOOK: http://www.veganricha.com/mybooks\n\nThe sauce is made in the Instant Pot before adding anything else to it, so that just the sauce can be cooked for a longer time. This helps roast the ingredients under pressure for that deep flavor profile. If you add veggies, they will overcook in the time needed for the sauce. You can pressure cook other ingredients such as tempeh, seitan, soy curls or chickpeas with the uncooked sauce ingredients. Just add them to the sauce before closing the lid. \n\nWith Cauliflower I prefer to bake it and then simmer in the cooked sauce for a few mins for best results. To cook it in the instant pot, pressure cook for just 1 minute at low pressure with the already cooked sauce or just Simmer with cooked sauce on the stove top/IP for 10-12 mins or until cauliflower is cooked to preference. \nTry it both ways to decide which you prefer, Add some chickpeas in for added protein. \n\n\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ BUY MY COOKBOOK: http://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen \nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ Join the Mailing List: https://veganricha.com/mailinglist\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ SUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\nâœ¦ JOIN THE COMMUNITY:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nâœ¦ COOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book:\nhttp://www.veganricha.com/vrekaz\nMy Amazon Store: https://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\n\n#veganricha #easyveganrecipes #vegan #veganism #veganrecipes #cooking \nMusic by Lakey Inspired\nhttps://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired/","uploadDate":"2018-09-29T18:26:04+00:00","duration":"PT1M56S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jpN3-rVtUxE/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpN3-rVtUxE","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jpN3-rVtUxE?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["6"],"prepTime":"PT10M","cookTime":"PT35M","totalTime":"PT45M","recipeIngredient":["1  medium head of cauliflower chopped into florets","2 tsp oil","1 tsp lemon juice","1/2 tsp ground cumin","1/2 tsp ground coriander","1/2 tsp garam masala","1/2 tsp smoked paprika","1/2 tsp garlic powder","1/2 tsp or more salt","1 Recipe my Tikka masala sauce (, use 2/3 of the sauce recipe if using a small head of cauliflower)","1/4 cup non dairy cream (such as cashew ( (blend 1/4 cup cashews with 1/4 cup water until smooth), soy, coconut (optional))"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"If you havent yet, make &nbsp;my Tikka Masala Sauce.
