Mung Bean egg mixture makes a great soy-free egg substitute. Easy Moong Dal Batter for omelets or savory pancakes. No Chickpea flour! \nFULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2019/12/vegan-omelet-with-mung-bean-egg.html\n\nMung bean is used in Indian cuisine to make pancakes, crepes format snack or breakfast. Moong Dal, which is split and skinned green Mung bean, has a nutty flavor (milder than chickpea flour) and makes for a great option to use to make egg-free omelets.\r\n\nI posted a moong dal omelet way back in 2013. At that time Moong dal was available in Indian stores and some other stores, hence the recipe didn’t get as many remakes. Mung bean dal is much more easily available now in many regular grocery stores and amazon and is used in many of my recipes.\r\n\r\nAs with any vegani-zed version of dishes, they are dependent on personal preference. Everyone prefers various textures and format of the egg and omelet. This moong dal batter is very flexible to flavor and texture. Play around with additional flavors and adjusting the consistency and cooking time for your preferred vegan omelet.\nVegan Gluten-free Grain-free soy-free Recipe Nut-free option.\n\n#veganricha #veganomelet #mungomelet #easyveganrecipes #veganbreakfast \nMusic: Epidemic sound","uploadDate":"2019-12-11T20:02:17+00:00","duration":"PT1M16S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vra0MKrjSYs/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vra0MKrjSYs","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vra0MKrjSYs?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["4"],"prepTime":"PT15M","cookTime":"PT25M","totalTime":"PT40M","recipeIngredient":["1 cup moong dal (split Mung beans)","1/2 tsp salt","3/4 tsp kala namak ((Indian sulphur salt))","1/4 tsp each garlic powder, onion powder","1/8 tsp black pepper","1/4 tsp turmeric (for color. too much will add flavor)","1 tsp oil","1 to 1 1/4 cup non dairy milk such as","2  potatoes (, cubed to a 1/4 inch )","1/2  onion (, finely chopped)","3 cloves garlic (, finely chopped)","1 cup bell pepper (, finely chopped, red or green or both)","1/2 tsp salt","1/2 tsp thyme + rosemary","1/4 tsp cayenne","a good dash of black pepper","2 tsp oil"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Wash and then soak the Moong Dal/split Mung Beans in 3 cups water overnight or atleast 8 hours.","name":"Wash and then soak the Moong Dal/split Mung Beans in 3 cups water overnight or atleast 8 hours.","url":"https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-omelet-with-mung-bean-egg/#wprm-recipe-32114-step-0-0"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Drain and add to a blender.
