In a large bowl, combine all purpose flour, instant yeast, and salt. Incorporate in the plant-based milk and vegan butter until a rough dough forms. If you find that the dough is still too dry, add in additional milk one tablespoon at a time and continue to incorporate. Using floured hands, knead the dough inside the bowl for about 10 minutes. As you knead the dough, try to clean off any remaining flour and mixture that were stuck to the sides of the bowl. Once the dough is smooth, form it into a ball (at this point I like to lift up the dough and sprinkle a little bit more flour on the bottom to prevent sticking). Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and let it rise for 2 hours, or until doubled in volume.","text":"Make the Dough. In a large bowl, combine all purpose flour, instant yeast, and salt.

Once the dough has risen, push the air bubbles out and move it onto a large floured surface. Roll the dough out into a large rectangular with even thickness of about 0.5-0.6 centimeters (around 0.2 inches). Once rolled out, bush throughout the surface of the dough with melted vegan butter, and sprinkle on the five-spice sugar mixture evenly. Starting from one end, roll the dough up lengthwise and place it seam side down. Cut up the rolled up dough into 8-10 rolls (I did 8) with a serrated knife. If you do not have a serrated knife, a regular knife works as well. Be sure to flour the knife and use a sawing motion to slowly saw through the dough — if you cut directly down, the layers will be smooshed up together.","text":"Make the Rolls.
