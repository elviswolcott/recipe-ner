Saucepan Option.\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡FULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2018/03/instant-pot-tomato-soup-tofu-croutons.html\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡MY COOKBOOK: https://veganricha.com/vrekaz\n\nThis soup is Gorgeous, delicious and super easy. Just blend up the ingredients, pour into the instant pot with some herbs, pressure cook for five minutes and you are done. I top the soup with crispy tofu croutons that work wonderfully. \n\nOregano, dill and basil add the flavor. Cashew or Coconut milk add creamyness. The soup can easily be made without tofu with other croutons (bread croutons, roasted chickpeas etc), without nuts with coconut milk and oil free by sauteing in broth. Try this delicious soup with Extra black pepper for the chilly days. The soup can also be easily made in a saucepan, see recipe notes. For variation, change up the herbs, add some red lentils (1/4 cup) with the tomato mix for a hearty soup. Build it up to make your own!\nMore Instant Pot Recipes: http://veganricha.com/category/instant-pot\n\n\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ MY COOKBOOKS: http://www.veganricha.com/mybooks\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ Join the Mailing List: https://veganricha.com/mailinglist\n\nðŸ’™ SUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\nðŸ’™ JOIN THE COMMUNITY:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nðŸ’™ COOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book:\nhttp://www.veganricha.com/vrekaz\nMy Amazon Store: https://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\n#vegan #veganism #easyveganrecipes #veganrecipes #veganricha #cooking \nMusic: In my Dreams By Lakey Inspired\nhttps://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired/","uploadDate":"2018-05-16T20:12:32+00:00","duration":"PT2M4S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hMlTHo2z7sk/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMlTHo2z7sk","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hMlTHo2z7sk?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["3"],"prepTime":"PT10M","cookTime":"PT25M","totalTime":"PT35M","recipeIngredient":["7 oz tofu (pressed for 10 minutes and cubed)","1 tablespoon fine cornmeal (, or use rice flour or breadcrumbs as sub)","1/2 teaspoon oregano","1/4 teaspoon onion powder","1/4 teaspoon garlic powder","1/4 teaspoon salt","1/4 teaspoon paprika","1 teaspoon oil","1/2  onion chopped","4 cloves of garlic chopped","1/4  cup carrots","15 ounces diced tomatoes","1/4 cup tomato paste","1 cup water or broth","1/2 teaspoon each oregano (basil)","1/2 tsp fresh dill or 1/4 tsp dried","1/2 teaspoon salt","1/4 teaspoon each onion powder ( and garlic powder)","1/4 teaspoon pepper flakes","3/4 cup cashew milk or thick full fat coconut milk (, 1/2 to 3/4 cup based on preference)","Black pepper for garnish (, sugar/sweetener for flavor (optional))"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Tofu Croutons: Combine all the herbs, spices in a bowl.
