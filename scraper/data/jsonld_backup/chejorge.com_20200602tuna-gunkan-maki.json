Make sure to use a spatula to turn them or move them around once every 30 minutes or so. The roast is a very slow one — the low temperature will slowly tenderize the watermelon without charring or caramelizing it, so as to retain that raw look. In the end, the watermelon should become squishy and bouncy. At this point, place them back into the marinade while you prepare your other ingredients. Note: When you place the hot watermelon (after roasting) back into the cold marinade, you not only allow the watermelon to cool down quicker, but allow the watermelon to re-absorb all that umami flavor from the marinade.","text":"Bake in the preheated oven for 1.5 hours to 2 hours.
