If you like it a little spicy, you can add cayenne to the rice as it's cooking, or do what I do: just squeeze a ton of sriracha sauce over it.","breadcrumb":{"@id":"https://thevietvegan.com/tomato-rice-and-beans/#breadcrumb"},"inLanguage":"en-US","potentialAction":[{"@type":"ReadAction","target":["https://thevietvegan.com/tomato-rice-and-beans/"]}]},{"@type":"BreadcrumbList","@id":"https://thevietvegan.com/tomato-rice-and-beans/#breadcrumb","itemListElement":[{"@type":"ListItem","position":1,"name":"Home","item":"https://thevietvegan.com/"},{"@type":"ListItem","position":2,"name":"Tomato Rice and Beans"}]},{"@type":"Article","@id":"https://thevietvegan.com/tomato-rice-and-beans/#article","isPartOf":{"@id":"https://thevietvegan.com/tomato-rice-and-beans/#webpage"},"author":{"@id":"https://thevietvegan.com/#/schema/person/32db954312f993c7607670eba9ef6c3e"},"headline":"Tomato Rice and Beans","datePublished":"2013-05-27T18:35:49+00:00","dateModified":"2020-09-30T21:02:04+00:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@id":"https://thevietvegan.com/tomato-rice-and-beans/#webpage"},"wordCount":351,"commentCount":4,"publisher":{"@id":"https://thevietvegan.com/#/schema/person/32db954312f993c7607670eba9ef6c3e"},"image":{"@id":"https://thevietvegan.com/tomato-rice-and-beans/#primaryimage"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://thevietvegan.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1058W.jpg","keywords":["appetizer","avocado","dinner","GF","gluten-free","lunch","rice","tomato","tomato paste","vegan","vegetarian"],"articleSection":["Appetizers &amp; Sides","Gluten-Free","Lunch","Vegan recipes"],"inLanguage":"en-US","potentialAction":[{"@type":"CommentAction","name":"Comment","target":["https://thevietvegan.com/tomato-rice-and-beans/#respond"]}]},{"@type":["Person","Organization"],"@id":"https://thevietvegan.com/#/schema/person/32db954312f993c7607670eba9ef6c3e","name":"Lisa Le","logo":{"@id":"https://thevietvegan.com/#personlogo"},"description":"Lisa is the thirty-something, nerdy, procrastinating, feminist blogger and photographer behind The Viet Vegan.
