GF option | Vegan Richa Recipes","description":"Vegan Cardamom Cookies. These Cookies are a cross between cardamom shortbread and Snickerdoodles. No Palm oil. GF option\nFULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2018/09/vegan-cardamom-cookies.html\nMY BOOKS: https://veganricha.com/mybooks\n\nIf you love cardamom, you will love these cookies! Soft, melt in your mouth cookies that remind you of shortbread, snickerdoodle, and Indian Desserts, all rolled into one. \n\nI use seeds from whole green cardamom pods and ground cardamom for extra flavor punch. The nut butter and almond flour add the texture. The cookie is easily refined sugar free and is palm oil free. Change up the spices to cinnamon, chai, pumpkin pie spice for variation.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nHi, I'm Richa!
