Nut-free Creamy Cajun Spice Sauce with Farfalle. 23 Gm of Protein.\nFULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2019/10/vegan-creamy-cajun-pasta-with-breaded-tofu.html\n\nThis Creamy Pasta Sauce has my cajun blend for a smoky delicious flavor profile. The sauce is creamy, fluffy and is made with tofu. I have started to make more Tofu sauces(Lemon Asparagus Pasta) as they are so much quicker than cashew sauces. They also amp up the protein in the meal!\n\nThe peppers and onions add flavor. I top the pasta with a smoky breaded tofu. You can use other toppings such as roasted cauliflower or veggies, or chickpeas or vegan meat subs. Or just serve as is! See Recipe notes for tofu-free option.\n\nMusic: Ikson Calling\n#easyveganrecipes #veganricha #cajunpasta #breadedtofu #veganpasta\n\n\nMY BOOKS:\nINDIAN KITCHEN:  https://veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nEVERYDAY KITCHEN: https://veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen\nBoth have about 150 Recipes each.
