This gum-free, Soy-free, Yeast-free bread can be made oat-free.\n\nThe pumpkin and banana hold the structure together and make this a very moist loaf and make this more of a Banana Pumpkin Bread. This bread also doesn’t need added gum. You can use a 1/2 tsp xanthan with the dry ingredients to help the crumb if you want. Use chocolate chips or dried fruit of choice for variation.\n\nThis loaf uses brown rice flour, almond flour, starch and oat flour. You can use any other flour which is similar to oat flour to sub oat flour if needed. I have not tried the loaf with any other starch. Arrowroot hasn’t worked well for me in the past. A blend of tapioca and corn might work, but I would recommend sticking to potato starch for the first try. Make this festive loaf with cranberries and walnuts/pecans and let me know how it turns out!\n\n\n******MORE PUMPKIN RECIPES FROM THE BLOG******\n\nONE BOWL VEGAN PUMPKIN CREAM CHEESE MUFFINS: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-pumpkin-cream-cheese-muffins/\n\nGLUTEN-FREE YEAST FREE PUMPKIN CINNAMON ROLLS: https://www.veganricha.com/gluten-free-yeast-free-pumpkin-cinnamon-rolls/\n\nVEGAN PUMPKIN CINNAMON ROLLS RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-pumpkin-cinnamon-rolls-recipe/\n\nPUMPKIN CINNAMON SWIRL BREAD: https://www.veganricha.com/pumpkin-cinnamon-swirl-bread/\n\n1 BOWL VEGAN PUMPKIN BREAD RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/1-bowl-vegan-pumpkin-bread-recipe/\n\nConnect with me on Social Media:\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\n\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/veganricha\n\nPINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/veganricha\n\nAUDIO DISCLAIMER/CREDIT\nMusic: Lakey Inspired\n\nSUBSCRIBE HERE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n\n #pumpkinbreadrecipe #pumpkinrecipes #glutenfreebaking #veganrecipes #Veganricha #easyveganrecipes","uploadDate":"2020-11-30T19:23:23+00:00","duration":"PT1M41S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1pWgWnD5VEE/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pWgWnD5VEE","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1pWgWnD5VEE?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["8"],"prepTime":"PT15M","cookTime":"PT60M","totalTime":"PT75M","recipeIngredient":["1/2 cup brown rice flour","1/2 cup almond flour","1/4 cup oat flour (certified Gluten-free or other gf flour of choice like white sorghum, amaranth etc , do not use bean flour)","1/4 cup potato starch","1 1/4 tsp baking powder","1/4 tsp baking soda","1/4 tsp salt","1/4 cup powdered sugar ((Blend up any unrefined sugar in a blender to make it fine))","1 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice","1/2 tsp chai spice  (or use more pumpkin pie spice)","1  very ripe banana (medium size)","1 tbsp pysllium husk powder  (or chia seed meal)","1/4 cup sugar (raw, coconut or other)","3/4 cup + 2 tbsp pumpkin puree (not pumpkin pie filling)","1/4 cup maple syrup","2 tbsp oil","1 tsp apple cider vinegar","3 Tbsp or more chopped walnuts","1/4 cup or more fresh or frozen cranberries"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Preheat the oven to 365 degrees F / 180ºc.
