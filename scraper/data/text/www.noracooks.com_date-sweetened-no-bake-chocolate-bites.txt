Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups raw walnuts
10  large soft medjool dates (pitted)
4 tablespoons cocoa powder
1 tablespoon water (optional)

Instructions:
In a food processor with an "S" blade, add the walnuts, dates and cocoa powder.
Process until a sticky dough is formed, about 1-2 minutes. You may need to scrape the sides of your food processor a few times so that it will come together. You should be able to easily roll it into balls without the dough falling apart.
If it still seems dry, add 1 tablespoon of water at a time until the dough is sticky and uniform, being careful not to add too much water.
Roll into tablespoon sized balls and place in a container. Store in the fridge or freezer.
