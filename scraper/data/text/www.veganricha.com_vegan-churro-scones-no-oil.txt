Ingredients:
1 3/4 cup flour ((I use 3/4 cup whole wheat and 1 cup unbleached all purpose))
1/4 cup almond flour (, or use more flour for nutfree)
2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
3 tbsp brown sugar or coconut sugar
1 tsp cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup cream from a chilled full fat coconut milk can
1/2 cup grated apple mixed with 1 tsp lemon juice
1/2 to 1 teaspoon vanilla extract ((depends on your vanilla preference))
Optional add ins: 1/3 cup chopped pecans or walnuts
1 tbsp brown sugar
1.5 tbsp cane sugar
3/4 tsp ground cinnamon

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 435 deg F ( 225 C) . Mix the dry ingredients(flour to salt) in a large bowl until well combined.
Add the coconut cream.&nbsp; Use a fork to mix it into the flour until it forms crumbs.
Add the apple, vanilla extract and mix in. Add coconut cream (use coconut milk if the mixture is very dry) 1 tbsp at a time until the dough begins to come together. Bring the dough together until somewhat smooth. do not knead or overwork the dough.
Place on parchment lined baking dish and shape into a 1 inch thick disk. Brush with coconut cream. Mix the sugars  and cinnamon and sprinkle all over.  Slice and move the slices to have half inch space between them.
Bake for 16 to 18 mins. Remove the scones from the dish after a minute. Serve hot with some vegan butter or a simple sugar icing or a fruit compote.&nbsp;Store&nbsp;covered on the counter for upto 2 days, or refrigerate in a container for upto 5 days or freeze for upto a month.&nbsp;Scones can be frozen unbaked for upto a month. Remove from the freezer and thaw for 10 mins(while the oven is preheating), then bake. Frozen scones might need 1-2 mins more to bake.&nbsp;
