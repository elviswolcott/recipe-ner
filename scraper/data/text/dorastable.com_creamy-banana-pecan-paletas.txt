Ingredients:
5  Bananas, ripe, peeled, (cut into rounds, and frozen overnight)
1/2  cup Almond milk, vanilla, unsweetened
1/3  cup Chopped pecans

Instructions:
Freeze peeled and cut bananas overnight in a Ziploc bag.
The following day place the bananas and almond milk in a blender or food processor and process until smooth.
If the mixture is too thick you can add some more almond milk.&nbsp;
You must work quickly otherwise your bananas will start to turn brown.
Pour the banana-almond milk mixture into a cold bowl.&nbsp;
Add half of the chopped pecans and mix well with a spatula.&nbsp;
Scoop the banana mixture into your popsicle molds and top with a generous sprinkle of chopped pecans.
Insert popsicle sticks and freeze overnight.&nbsp;
