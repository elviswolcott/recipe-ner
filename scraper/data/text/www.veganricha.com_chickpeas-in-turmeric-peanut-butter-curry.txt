Ingredients:
1/4 cup chopped onion
4 cloves of garlic
1 inch knob of ginger
1/2 tsp oil
1/2 tsp ground cumin
1/2 tsp or more ground coriander
1/4 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp cardamom (optional)
1/3 tsp or more cayenne
1/2 tsp or more turmeric
3 tbsp or more peanut butter  (or almond butter)
1/2 cup non dairy milk like coconut or almond milk
3/4 cup water or broth
1/2  red bell pepper (sliced)
1/2 cup or more sliced carrots
1/2 cup or more sliced summer squash ( or zucchini)
15 oz can chickpeas drained and washed (or 1.5 cups cooked, or use cooked lentils)
1/2 tsp or more salt
1 tsp or more sugar or other sweetener of choice
1/2 to 1 tsp lime juice
1/4 cup chopped cilantro (or use 2 tbsp thai basil)
pepper flakes to taste

Instructions:
Blend the onion, ginger, garlic with 2 to 3 tbsp water until smooth. Keep aside. I use a NutriBullet and the small amount works in the small blender. Alternatively, finely mince the onion, garlic and ginger as use.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. When hot, add cumin, coriander, cinnamon, cardamom, cayenne and cook until fragrant. 15 to 30 seconds.
Add in the onion puree to the skillet and mix. Mix in the turmeric and cook until the mixture is well roasted and onion does not smell raw. 7 to 9 minutes. Stir occasionally. (Cook at a slightly lower heat if using minced onion garlic).
Add in the nut butter, non dairy milk and mix in. it will take a half minute for the nut butter to mix. Add water. Mix well.
Add the veggies and chickpeas, salt, sugar. Mix, cover and bring to a boil. 4 mins. Reduce heat to medium low and continue to cook for 5 minutes. Mix in the lime juice and cilantro. Taste and adjust salt and heat. Add red pepper flakes to taste and mix in. At this point you can also mix in some baby greens, and adjust the curry consistency (add more non dairy milk or cook longer for thicker).
Continue to simmer for another 3 to 4 minutes until the curry thickens a little. Serve over rice or cooked grains of choice.
