Ingredients:
1 cup frozen raspberries and red currants (I used them in a equal amount, but of course that's totally up to you)
1/4 cup water
1 tablespoon chia seeds
1  banana, peeled
1  apple, peeled and roughly chopped
1  orange, peeled
1  kiwi, peeled
1/4  pineapple, peeled and roughly chopped
2-3 hand full fresh spinach
2   dried dates or figs
1  passion fruit
1 tablespoon chia seeds
1 tablespoon flax seeds
1 tablespoon sesame seeds
3/4 cup water

Instructions:
First make the red smoothie layer: Put the frozen raspberries and red currants together with the water and the chia seeds in a food processor and blend until smooth.
Fill the mixture into the popsicle molds and put them in the freezer for a couple of minutes while making the green smoothie. Make sure to put them in an upright position.
For the green smoothie, place all ingredients in a food processor and blend until smooth. Fill the smoothie into the popsicle molds and put them in the freezer for at least 2-3 hours depending on your freezer.
