Ingredients:
1/2 cup tahini
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/4 cup pure maple syrup, or less to taste
1/4-1/2 teaspoon salt, to taste
2-4  tablespoons water, or more as needed to thin

Instructions:
Add all ingredients to a medium bowl. Whisk until creamy and smooth, adding water as needed to thin the dressing. This will depend on the thickness of your tahini. If your tahini is really thick or chunky and difficult to whisk, you can use a blender/food processor or immersion blender.
Add more salt to taste. If you want a less sweet dressing, you can use less maple syrup, but I think 1/4 cup is just perfect for a sweet, lemony creamy dressing.
Serve over salads, buddha bowls, drizzle on falafel, veggie burgers or steamed vegetables. Basically, pour it on everything!
