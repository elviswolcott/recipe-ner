Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups raw cashews
3/4 cup water
1/4 cup brine from a jar of green olives
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoons white vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt (or 2 teaspoons for more saltiness!)
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
2 teaspoons agar agar powder

Instructions:
Bring 3 cups of water to a boil. Pour the hot water over the cashews and let soak for 5 minutes.
Drain the cashews, discard the soaking water and add the cashews, 3/4 cup fresh water and all other ingredients to a high powered blender EXCEPT the agar agar powder. Blend until smooth.
Add agar agar powder to the blender and blend to incorporate.
Transfer to a small pot and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until it begins to simmer. Cook for about 2 minutes until it thickens, then remove from heat and place in a mold (I used a round glass bowl).
Chill at room temperature for 10-15 minutes, then transfer to the refrigerator, uncovered for at least 3 hours until firm.
That&#39;s it! The cheese is semi-soft and spreadable, but you can also slice or crumble it. Enjoy!
