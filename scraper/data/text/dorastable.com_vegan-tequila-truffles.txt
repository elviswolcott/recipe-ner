Ingredients:
1/2 cup Coconut milk (full fat)
12 oz. Vegan Dark Chocolate at least 70% Cacao (finely chopped)
1 pinch Sea Salt
1/2 tsp. Mexican Vanilla Extract
2 tbsp. Tequila
¼-½ tsp. Chili Powder (optional)
1/4 cup Cocoa powder (for dusting)

Instructions:
In a medium saucepan heat the the coconut milk over medium heat. When the milk comes to a low boil add the chopped chocolate and continually stir until about ¾ of the chocolate has melted. Turn off the heat and add the pinch of salt, vanilla, tequila and chili powder if using. Keep stirring until all of the chocolate has melted.&nbsp;
Pour the chocolate into a loaf pan or shallow dish. Refrigerate for 2 hours, or until the chocolate is almost solid. If the chocolate is still wet in some spots continue chilling until firm.&nbsp;
Once the chocolate is chilled and firm, prepare a dish with the cocoa powder for rolling. Use a tablespoon sized scoop to scoop out small balls; I like to use a cookie scoop. Scoop out the tablespoon size balls then gently use your hands to roll into a round ball shape. Toss in cocoa powder to coat and shake off the excess. Transfer to a cookie sheet or pan lined with wax paper. Continue until all the chocolate has been scooped out. Depending on the size of the scoop, you should get about 14-16 truffles.&nbsp;
Enjoy the truffles right away or store in a tightly covered container in the fridge. Let the truffles come up to room temperature before serving, about 10-15 minutes.&nbsp;
