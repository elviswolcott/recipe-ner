Ingredients:
14 oz green asparagus
14 oz fresh strawberries
9 oz whole wheat rotini or penne ((for a gluten-free version use brown rice rotini))
2 handful baby arugula or baby spinach
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon maple syrup
1/2 teaspoon salt
black pepper, to taste
balsamic reduction, optional

Instructions:
With a knife, cut off the woody part of the asparagus. Then cut them into about 1.5 inch pieces.
Cook the pasta according to the instructions on the package. Rinse with cold water after cooking.
Heat some oil in a large pan and cook the asparagus on high heat for about 8 minutes.
In the meantime, make the dressing. Combine all the ingredients in a small bowl and whisk well.
Wash and cut the strawberries into slices. In a large bowl combine the cooked asparagus, the strawberries, the pasta, and the arugula or baby spinach. Add the dressing and stir well.
Top the salad off with balsamic reduction (optional).&nbsp;This salad is best served fresh. I don't like storing it for more than two hours in the fridge because the strawberries soak up the dressing very fast and aren't fresh anymore.
