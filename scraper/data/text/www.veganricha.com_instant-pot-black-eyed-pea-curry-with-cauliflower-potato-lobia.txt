Ingredients:
3/4 cup black eyed peas (soaked for atleast half an hour in warm water)
1 tsp oil
½  a medium onion chopped
5 cloves of garlic (chopped)
½ inch ginger (finely chopped)
1/2 tsp garam masala  ( or 1 tsp sambhar masala, or use ½ tsp cumin + ½ tsp coriander)
1/2 tsp ground coriander
1 tsp turmeric (use less if you are sensitive to the flavor)
¼ to ½ tsp cayenne
2 tbsp shredded coconut (dried or fresh)
2  juicy tomatoes pureed  (or 1¼ cup)
1.5 cups or more veggies chopped small (I use small cauliflower florets and cubed potato or sweet potato)
¾ tsp or more salt
2 cups water
lemon for garnish
1 tsp oil
1/2 tsp cumin seeds
10  curry leaves (fresh are best)

Instructions:
Press Saute on Instant Pot and let it get hot. Add oil and spread using a spatula. Add onion, garlic, ginger and cook for 5 mins.
Add the spices and coconut and mix in. Cook for a minute.
Add pureed tomato. Mix and bring to a good boil. Add the veggies and mix in.
Add drained black eyed peas, water and salt and mix in. Close the lid and cook on Manual for 12 to 15 minutes.
Let the pressure release naturally. Open the lid, add a dash of lemon. Taste and adjust salt, spice and heat.
Make the tempering. Heat oil in a small skillet. When hot, add cumin seeds and let them change color. Add curry leaves carefully, (they will splutter) then take off heat. Add the tempering over the curry. Serve as a soup in a bowl or over rice or other grains of choice, or with flatbread,&nbsp;Naan&nbsp;or pita bread.
