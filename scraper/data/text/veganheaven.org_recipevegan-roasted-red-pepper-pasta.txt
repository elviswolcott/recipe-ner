Ingredients:
2  red bell peppers
1  red onion
2  cloves of garlic
1/2 cup cashews
1 cup unsweetened almond or soy milk ((make sure the milk you use is unsweetened) )
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
1/2 teaspoon salt
black pepper, to taste
red pepper flakes, to taste
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika powder
9 oz fettuccine
chopped fresh parsley, to serve

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 Â°F. Cut the red bell peppers and the onion into stripes. Together with the garlic, place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake for 10 minutes.
In the meantime, cook the fettuccine according to the instructions on the package. Set aside.
Get the bell pepper, the onion, and the garlic out of the oven and place them in a high speed blender together with the remaining ingredients and process until smooth.
Pour the red bell pepper sauce into a saucepan and heat it up for a couple of minutes. Stir in the cooked fettuccine and serve immediately. Sprinkle with fresh chopped parsley and more red pepper flakes if you like. Enjoy!
