Ingredients:
1/2 cup urad daal ((split black gram daal))
1/2 cup brown rice
1/2 cup white rice ((I used basmati.. typically should use parboiled rice))
1/4 cup toor daal ((split pigeon pea))
1/4 cup chana daal ((split Bengal gram))
2 teaspoons methi seeds ((Fenugreek seeds))
1 inch ginger
1  dried red chili
handful of methi leaves ((fresh fenugreek leaves))
salt to taste

Instructions:
Soak all the to be soaked items overnight (12 hours) .. its quite cold here right now.. so i usually let it be for 12-16 hours.
Drain the water and grind the soaked lentils/grains along with ginger, dried red chili, washed fenugreek leaves and salt(1/2 teaspoon or more) with little water if needed.
If this mixture doesnt look fermented enough, add 1/4 teaspoon baking powder, or keep for another 4-6 hours in a warm place.
Grease Idli stand and mix and pour the batter.
Steam the idlis for 20 mins and let stand for another 10 before removing from idli stand.
Serve with sambhar (Pigeon Pea curry), coconut chutney or any podi (dry chutney)! Serve in breakfast or lunch! There are other lentils or oats and grains, vegetables can be added as well.
