Ingredients:
1 cup bread flour
3  or more cups whole wheat flour
2 teaspoons active yeast
1/2 teaspoons dark brown sugar
1  mango (I used honey manila mango 1/2 pureed and 1/2 chopped)
1 cup raspberries
1 cup water
1/2 cup milk
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
2-3  mint leaves crushed

Instructions:
I made the starter this time and let it sit in the refrigerator for a day. For the starter, warm 1/2 cup water and add 1 teaspoon yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar to it and mix well.
Let it sit for 10 minutes or until frothy.
Add 1 cup bread flour to it and mix well.
Keep this mixture in a covered container in the fridge for a day.
For the main dough, warm 1/2 cup water and add 1 teaspoon yeast to it and mix well.
Let it stand until frothy(10 minutes)
Add in the milk, sugar, 1 cup wheat flour, salt and nutmeg and mix well.
Add in the mango puree(1/2 mango) and crushed mint. (You can add more mango puree if to add a more mango taste to the bread!!)
Add in the starter dough which has been brought to room temperature.
Add wheat flour 1 cup at a time and knead into a soft dough.
Place dough in a well oiled container, cover it with plastic wrap and place in a warm oven for an hour or until doubled.
Take the dough out and knead on a well floured surface for 5 minutes.
Add in the chopped mango and raspberries and knead well.
Place this dough in a well oiled bread pan.
Place pan in a warm oven for half an hour.
Bake at 350 degrees F&nbsp; / 180Âºc for 30-35 minutes. Spray water twice every 5 minutes in the first 10 minutes of baking.
Tap the bread to see if it makes a hollow sound to confirm that the bread is done.
Cool on rack before slicing!
