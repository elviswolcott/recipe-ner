Ingredients:
1 1/4 cup of my waffle mix (below) or   (all purpose flour + 2 tsp starch)
2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
3 tbsp sugar (, fine cane sugar or coconut sugar or light brown)
1 1/4 cup non-dairy milk such as almond or soy or light coconut milk
1 tbsp oil (, plus more for cooking if needed)
1 tsp vanilla extract
a few drops almond extract ( or 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon)
3/4 cup unbleached all purpose flour
1/3 cup wheat pastry flour  (or use more all purpose)
1 tbsp starch such as tapioca or cornstarch
2 tbsp almond flour (or use 1 tbsp rice flour for nut-free)
1 tsp flax seed meal (,optional)

Instructions:
In a large bowl, whisk the flours under waffle mix. Add baking powder, salt, sugar and mix well.
Add the oil and 1 cup + 2 tbsp non dairy milk and whisk well. Depending on the flours and non dairy milk used, you will need 1-2 tbsp more milk for a smooth batter. (You can add in chocolate chips or small blueberries in the batter at this time for variation)
Let the batter sit for atleast 15 mins. (You can adjust the batter at this time if too thick, with additional non dairy milk, or a tbsp of flour if too thin)
Heat your waffle maker. When hot, brush or spray oil if needed. Add the batter depending on the size of your waffle iron. (*Add a smaller portion of the batter, sprinkle some cinnamon sugar mix and add another tbsp or so batter on top for cinnamon swirl waffles)
Cook until golden. The waffles will crisp more on cooling for a min or so. Remove the waffle and serve immediately or store in a warm oven (225 deg F) until ready to use. Serve with a drizzle of maple syrup, some vegan butter, fruits and other toppings and sides or choice. Store: Freeze the waffles once fully cooled in an airtight container. That for a few mins, then reheat in a toaster and serve.
