12 oz mushrooms (, sliced, (white or combination or white, cremini, portobello))
1/4 cup orange juice (or cider(plain cider not vinegar), half of both)
2 tsp lime juice
1 tbsp soy sauce  (or tamari for glutenfree, or coconut aminos for soyfree)
1/4-1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp ground cumin
2 tsp ground coriander
1.5 tsp smoked paprika (, or use 1 tsp sweet paprika and 1/2 tsp smoked forless heat)
1.5Â  tsp oregano
1/4 tsp black pepper
1/2 tsp or more chipotle pepper
1 to 2 tsp chili powder blend or use more of the above spices and herbs
optional flavors: Add 1/2 tsp poultry seasoning , add 2 tbsp beer

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 400 deg F (205 C). Line a baking dish with parchment.&nbsp;
Add the sliced onion, garlic, jalapeno, mushrooms to a large bowl. Add the orange juice/cider, lime and soy sauce and toss to mix well. Let it sit to marinate for atleast 10 mins (or chill for an hour).
Mix the ground spices in a small bowl and sprinkle on the mushrooms. Add salt if using. Toss well to coat.
Drop the mushroom mixture onto parchment lined baking dish. Spread the mixture around so it forms a mostly single layer. Spray oil all over(optional).
Bake for 30 mins, then move the mushrooms around so the ones on the edges dont burn.(If the mushrooms or marinade is burning on the edges already, then reduce temp to 350 deg F). Bake for another 5 to 15 mins depending on preferred browning (also depends on the mushrooms used and thickness of the slices).
Serve in tacos or wraps or bowls with mashed avocado/guacamole, jalapeno, vegan sour cream, or salsa. Add some cooked beans, or refried beans for added protein.&nbsp;Store refrigerated for upto 4 days. Pictured with mashed avocado+ lime, jalapeno, vegan sour cream.
