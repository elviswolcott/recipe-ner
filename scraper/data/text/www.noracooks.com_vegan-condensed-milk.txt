Ingredients:
13.5 ounce can coconut cream
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
pinch of salt (~1/8th teaspoon)

Instructions:
In a small saucepan, combine the coconut cream, sugar, vanilla and salt over medium-high heat.
Whisk well to combine and bring the mixture to a boil then quickly reduce the heat and simmer on low heat for 40-45 minutes, whisking every 5-10 minutes. The liquid should be reduced by about half when it&#39;s done. It will still be fairly thin at first, but as it cools it will thicken up nicely.
Remove from heat and transfer to a glass container with a lid. Place in the refrigerator to chill for at least an hour before using.
Leftover vegan condensed milk can be stored in a covered container for up to 2 weeks. To freeze, store in a jar with a tight fitting lid. When ready to use, thaw in the refrigerator overnight then add to a bowl and whisk until smooth (or throw it in a blender until smooth).
