Ingredients:
2 Tablespoons oil (I use 1 Tbsp virgin coconut and 1 organic canola oil. or Use 1.5 Tbps nut butter and 1 Tbsp canola oil)
1.5 Tablespoons warm water or non dairy milk
2 teaspoons flaxmeal
1 Tablespoon agave syrup or maple
3-4 Tablespoons raw sugar or equivalent sweetener (3 for moderate sweet)
2/3 cup Oats (I used old fashioned)
1/3 cup whole wheat flour (Use Oat flour for gf)
2 Tablespoons all purpose flour or Spelt flour (Skip for gf)
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon spices of choice (I use cloves and cinnamon powder)
1/3-1/2 cup cranberries

Instructions:
In a bowl, add flaxmeal, warm water, agave, oils and sugar and mix for 2 minutes.
In another bowl, whisk the flours, salt and baking powder well.
Add the 1/4 cup flour mix, oats and cranberries or chocolate chips or both and/or almond slivers to the wet mix.
Mix to combine well, add more flour (and oats), if the mix is too wet to form a slightly stiff doughy mix.
Drops spoonfuls on parchment or greased baking sheet.
Flatten a little and Bake 12-14 minutes at 350 degrees F until the edges are golden and the center is not runny.
Cool on rack for 2 minutes before finishing them off!
