Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
3 tablespoons room temperature vegan butter
1 tablespoon miso
1/2 cup brown sugar
1  flax egg (1 tablespoon flaxseed meal + 3 tablespoons water)
1/2 cup vegan dark chocolate chips (more as desired)

Instructions:
Make the flax egg. In a small bowl, combine flaxseed meal and water. Mix well, and let sit at room temperature for at least 5 minutes, or until thickened.
In a large bowl, combine flour, baking powder, and baking soda.
In another large bowl, whisk together room temperature vegan butter, brown sugar, and miso. Cream this mixture for around three minutes, until its homogenous and nicely incorporated.
Add the flax egg into the creamed mixture and mix well. Then in goes the dry ingredients (mixed in step 1), followed by chocolate chips. Mix everything together well.
Scoop the mixture and shape them into balls â€” I portioned it into 6 balls. Place them onto a baking tray lined with parchment paper and chill in the fridge for at least thirty minutes.*
When thirty minutes is almost up, pre-heat the oven to 180 degrees Celsius (356 Fahrenheit). Bake the cookies for 16-18 minutes, or until they are golden-brown.  Cool them on a wire wrack and enjoy while still warm.
