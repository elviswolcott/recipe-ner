Ingredients:
3/4 cup warm-hot water
1/4 cup aquafaba
1 tbsp sugar or other sweetener
1 tbsp maple syrup
1  packet active yeast (or 2 1/2 tsp active yeast)
2 tbsp oil (or use melted vegan butter. I usually use oil)
1 tsp nutritional yeast (optional)
2.5 cups or more flour (I use unbleached white or a combination of white and wheat flour)
1/3 tsp salt
1 to 2 tbsp Oil  (or melted vegan butter)
1/3 cup or more coconut sugar  (or brown sugar)
2 to 3 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp salt
Add some cardamom or nutmeg for variation

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F / 180ºc. Line a 8 by 8 inch brownie pan or 9 inch pie pan with parchment. Mix the first 5 ingredients under rolls until the sugar is mixed in. Let sit for a minute for the yeast to activate.
Add in the oil, nutritional yeast and mix in. Add 2 cups flour and salt and knead. Add more flour, few tbsps at a time to make a soft somewhat smooth dough. 4 to 6 mins.
Roll the dough out using additional flour into a 10 by 14 inch rectangle
Spray or brush oil or vegan butter on the rolled out dough. (use as much melted vegan butter as you like :)).Sprinkle sugar, cinnamon and salt evenly. Roll the dough tightly along the longer edge to make a cylinder.
Slice using a pizza cutter or floss or a serrated knife. Place the slices in a parchment lined brownie baking pan or pie pan. Spray or brush oil on top. Cover lightly with a towel and Let the pan sit near the warm oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until just about doubled. Remove the towel.
Bake at 350f / 180ºc for 21 to 23 minutes or until golden on some edges.(just about starting to get golden)
Let the rolls sit for a few minutes, while you make the icing or frosting of choice. Frost and serve.
