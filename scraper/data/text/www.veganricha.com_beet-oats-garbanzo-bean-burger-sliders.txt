Ingredients:
1/2  medium beet ((peeled and grated/shredded))
1/2 cup garbanzo beans/chickpeas ((washed and drained if canned, cooked till soft after soaking overnight, if dry beans))
1/2  medium potato boiled ((1/3 cup))
1/2 cup oats ((coarsely crushed/blended))
2 teaspoons minced garlic ((3-4 cloves))
1 tablespoon thick tomato paste or pureed roasted tomato.
1/2 teaspoon cumin powder
1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste
1/4 teaspoon chili powder/chili flakes/black pepper (or to taste)
1/2 teaspoon chole/chana masala powder ((See Notes or garam masala or spice mix(cajun or Mediterranean) of choice))
1 tablespoon olive oil

Instructions:
In a bowl, add grated beet, mashed garbanzo beans, mashed potato. Mix and mash well.
Add in the salt, olive oil, tomato paste and spices. Mix well and let sit for 5 minutes.
The mixture will get a little damp because of the salt and spices. Add half of the ground oats and mix well.
Add more oats if needed to get the mixture to a dry enough state to make flat balls/ patties.
Press the patties on the remaining oats on a plate, to stick the coarse oatmeal on both sides.
Place patties on parchment paper on a baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven at 350 degrees F, for 15-20 minutes or until the patties start to feel crisp on the outside.
Serve immediately with dipping sauce, or top some greens or in sliders, or cool on rack and store in refrigerator for 2-3 days! Have a fun meatless Tuesday!
