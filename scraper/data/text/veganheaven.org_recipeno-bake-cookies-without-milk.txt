Ingredients:
1 cup dark chocolate, roughly chopped
1/3 cup peanut butter
1 1/3 cup rolled oats
1 tablespoon almond milk or other plant-based milk ((optional but recommended) )

Instructions:
First, melt the chocolate (either use a microwave or melt it on the stovetop).
Once it's melted, stir in the oats and the peanut butter and add a splash of the plant-based milk if using. Stir until well combined.
Put some parchment paper on a plate and evenly divide the no bake cookie batter. Form about six cookies and place them in the fridge for at least 2-3 hours, so they got enough time to harden up.
