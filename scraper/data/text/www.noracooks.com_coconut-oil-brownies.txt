Ingredients:
1/2 cup refined coconut oil (*for no coconut flavor)
1/2 cup dairy free chocolate chips
1 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup unsweetened soy milk  (*or other non-dairy milk)
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
3/4 cup all purpose flour
1/2 cup cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup more chocolate chips, optional for folding in

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and lightly grease an 8x8 inch metal baking pan.
In a large microwave safe bowl, add the coconut oil and 1/2 cup chocolate chips. Make sure to correctly measure your coconut oil, do not accidentally add too much or too little or the brownies may turn out greasy. Place the bowl in the microwave and cook for about 2 minutes, stirring after 1 minute every 30 seconds until melted and smooth.
Whisk in the sugar until it begins to dissolve in the warm oil/chocolate. Now add the soy milk and vanilla and whisk well to combine.
Add the flour, cocoa and salt to the bowl  and stir with a spoon until just mixed, being careful not to over mix. Stir in the extra chocolate chips, if desired (I always do).
Pour into the prepared pan and bake for 30 minutes, until the top is crinkly and the edges are pulling away from the sides a bit. Let cool for a few minutes before enjoying. They will cut better if they cool for at least 30 minutes, but can be eaten sooner for a fudgier, melty experience!
