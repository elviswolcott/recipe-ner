Ingredients:
1 tsp oil
1  small onion chopped ((I usually just process the onion, garlic, ginger and chilli to chop in aÂ  processor or a chopper))
6 cloves of garlic (finely chopped)
1 inch of ginger (finely chopped)
1  hot green chili (such as serrano or bird's eye)
1 tsp turmeric
1 tsp paprika ((combination of sweet and smoked))
1 tsp coriander powder
1/3 to 1/2 tsp cayenne
1/2 to 1 tsp Garam Masala
2 tsp dried fenugreek leaves (,plus more for garnish)
1/4 cup chopped red or green bell pepper
28 oz diced tomatoes(including juices) (or 15 oz diced + 2 ripe tomato chopped)
1/2 cup non dairy yogurt (, plain unsweetened, plain lightly sweetened also works)
3/4 tsp salt
1/4 cup non dairy cream (such as cashew, soy or coconut (optional))
smoked paprika or cayenne for garnish

Instructions:
Press saute on Instant Pot. When hot, add the oil then add finely chopped onion, ginger, garlic, and chili. Add good pinch of salt, mix well and cook for about 3 minutes. Stir occasionally&nbsp;
Add the spices and mix well. Add bell pepper and mix well.&nbsp;Add tomatoes and non dairy yogurt and salt and mix well. (stir well for a few seconds to pick up the scorched onion bits, else they tend to scorch more and cause burn errors in some sensitive instant pots)
Cancel saute. Close the lid. Pressure cook for 11-12 mins (manual high pressure)
Let the pressure release naturally. Open the lid. mix, taste and adjust salt, flavor, heat. Add some sugar or maple syrup if needed. (I add 1/2 tsp if using plain unsweetened yogurt).&nbsp;Add some more fenugreek leaves or cilantro, some fresh smoked paprika or cayenne and garam masala for garnish.
At this point you can freeze the tikka masala sauce for upto 2 months, and refrigerate for upto 4 days. Add some non dairy dream for creamier and use or store(refrigerated or freeze). You can also blend half of the sauce for smoother.&nbsp;
