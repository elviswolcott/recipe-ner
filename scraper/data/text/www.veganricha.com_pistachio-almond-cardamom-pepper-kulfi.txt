Ingredients:
3 Tablespoons raw Pistachios
1 Tablespoon raw almonds
1/2 cup almond milk or other non dairy milk  (or make your own nut milk)
2 teaspoons cornstarch or any thickening starch (or 1 Tablespoon ground cashew)
1/8 teaspoon cardamom powder
a pinch of saffron (optional)
2-4 Tablespoons raw sugar (powdered ( to taste))

Instructions:
Grind the Pistachios and then the almonds into as fine a powder as possible.(some of it may become buttery, which is fine), or use pistachio or almond butter,
In a blender, add the ground Pistachios and almonds, cornstarch, raw sugar, spices and Almond milk. Blend well until the mixture is well combined.
Transfer mix to a pan and bring to just about a boil on low-medium heat, stirring almost constantly.
Or microwave for 30 seconds. Stir and microwave for 30 seconds again(it should bubble slightly).
The mixture will thicken at just about the boiling stage. Add a few tsp more nut flour(pistachio/almond or cashew) if you like it the kulfi mix to be really thick. If adding cashew flour, then bring to a boil.
Take off heat. Let cool a bit. Taste and adjust sugar.
Add in the cardamom, pepper/candied ginger is using, mix , then transfer to Popsicle, Kulfi, or ice cream molds or ramekins.
Cover the open molds/ramekins with aluminium foil and let freeze overnight.
Let the popsicles or molds sit out or dip in warm-hot water to take the frozen ice cream out.
Serve as is, or in a parfait with fresh mango, pistachio, and ginger snap crumbs.
Or drizzle some salted caramel or peppered sugar syrup.
