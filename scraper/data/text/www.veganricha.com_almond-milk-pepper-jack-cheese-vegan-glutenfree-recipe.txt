Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups almond milk (divided)
1.5 Tbsp tapioca starch or use arrowroot starch
1.5 Tbsp cornstarch or arrowroot starch
1.5 Tbsp chickpea flour
2 Tbsp or more nutritional yeast
2 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil
2 tsp or more lemon juice
1 tsp apple cider vinegar
1/2 to 3/4 tsp salt
1/2 tsp garlic powder or use 1 tsp garlic paste
1/2 tsp onion powder
2.5 tsp agar powder (see note for agar flakes)
1/2 tsp or more red pepper flakes

Instructions:
Grease a glass container with extra virgin olive oil and keep ready. In a bowl, whisk 1/2 cup almond milk with the starches, chickpea flour, nutritional yeast, extra virgin olive oil, vinegar, lemon juice, spices and salt.
In a pan, add 1 cup of almond milk and agar powder and heat on medium heat, Bring to a rolling boil and cook for 4 mins.
Reduce heat to low and slowly add in the almond milk starch mixture from step 1 and mix.
Increase heat to medium and continue to mix and cook for 4 to 5 minutes.
Add in the pepper flakes and fold in. Carefully (the mix will be hot) taste and adjust salt, tang (lemon juice) and spice. You want it to be slightly more saltier, spicier in the liquid state.
