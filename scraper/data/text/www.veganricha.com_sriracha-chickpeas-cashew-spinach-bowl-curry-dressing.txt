Ingredients:
15 oz can chickpeas ( or 1.5 cups cooked)
2 tsp oil
1 to 1.5 tbsp sriracha (or other hot sauce or asian chile garlic sauce)
1/3 tsp salt
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp onion powder
1/2 to 1 tsp garam masala or curry powder
1 to 2 tbsp rice flour
1/2 cup cashews
1/2  tsp oil
1 tsp sriracha
1/4 tsp garam masala
1/4 cup vegan ranch or vegan mayo
1/4 tsp garam masala or curry powder
1/4 to 1/2 tsp turmeric
1 tsp lemon juice
8 oz Baby spinach or Greens
sliced carrots
sliced celery or cucumber

Instructions:
Add chickpeas, oil, sriracha, salt, garlic, onion, garam masala in a bowl till and toss to coat. Add rice flour 1/2 tbsp at a time and mix until the mixture gets pasty and sticks to the chickpeas.
Spread the chickpeas on a parchment lined baking dish or sheet.
In the same bowl, mix 1 tsp sriracha, 1/2 tsp oil, 1/4 tsp garam masala and 1/4 tsp salt. Add cashews and mix to coat. Add a tsp of rice flour and mix in. Spread them on another small baking sheet .(or add them 10 mins later to the chickpea baking dish).
Bake at 425 degrees F (218 C). Take the cashew sheet out at the 18-20 minute mark. Check the chickpeas and continue to bake until preferred crispyness.
Make the dressing: Combine all the ingredients. Thin with water if needed for a creamy dressing consistency. Taste and adjust. Add a bit of sweetener if needed. (You can also use plain cashew cream. Add some salt, pepper, onion powder, more lemon juice and dill to the cashew cream.) Or use just plain vegan ranch or Peanut Sauce to dress.
Assemble the bowl with spinach, raw or lightly roasted carrots, celery or cucumber, and a good helping of the chickpeas and cashews. Drizzle the dressing generously over the bowl and serve.
