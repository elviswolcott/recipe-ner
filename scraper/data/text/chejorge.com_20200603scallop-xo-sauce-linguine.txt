Ingredients:
2 large king oyster mushrooms
1 tablespoon chili oil
1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil
130 grams shiitake mushrooms (or white mushrooms)
1/2  yellow onion, minced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ginger, minced
1/4 teaspoon ground five-spice
2  dried chilis, crushed
2 tablespoons light soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon white pepper
1/2 teaspoon red pepper powder
4 tablespoons vegetable oil (or other neutral oil)
2 tablespoons dried seaweed, shredded
200 grams linguine
3 tablespoons Mushroom XO Sauce
1  scallion, thinly sliced, to plate
shredded nori, to plate

Instructions:
Today we're working with the king oyster mushroom.
Trim off the ends and slice the mushrooms into around 1 cm thick cylinders.
With a knife, gently score one side of each cylinder. See the video above for how I score it!
In a pan, heat up the vegetable oil on high heat. Sear each "scallop" with the scored side down first. Flip when the scored side is crispy and golden.
Once you flipped all the "scallops," add the chili oil. Baste* the scallops with the chili oil. When both sides are golden-brown, they are ready. Take off the heat and set aside.
Prepare the pasta according to the directions on its packet. When the pasta is 2 minutes from being done, heat up the XO sauce in another pan.
Add the cooked pasta, a few tablespoons of pasta water, and toss to emulsify. Finally, add the scallops and top everything with thinly sliced scallions and nori.
