Ingredients:
1 cup dried soy curls (TVP)
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup unsweetened almond milk
1/4 cup water
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons paprika powder
1 cup panko bread crumbs
1 cup Frank&#039;s Red Hot Buffalo Sauce
1/2 cup vegan mayonnaise
1 teaspoon freshly chopped dill
1 teaspoon freshly chopped parsley
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste

Instructions:
Place the soy curls in a pot or large bowl and add boiling water or vegetable broth. Let them soak for 10 minutes. They will double or even triple in size. 
Drain them and cool them down with cold running water. 
Squeeze out any extra water with your hands. 
In a large bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, the plant-based milk, the water, the garlic power, the paprika powder, the salt, and the black pepper.
Stir until well combined. Fill a bowl with panko bread crumbs. Dip the soy curls into the flour batter. Then roll them in the panko bread crumbs. 
Place them in your air fryer and set it to 350 F.
Cook them for 10-12 minutes. 
Pour the Frank&#039;s Red Hot Buffalo Sauce in a bowl and evenly coat the soy curls from all sides by carefully stirring them a few times.
Place them back into the air fryer and cook them for 5 more minutes at 350 F.
In the meantime, prepare the vegan ranch dip. Finely chop fresh parsley and dill. Place the vegan mayonnaise in a small bowl and add the parsley and dill. Stir until well combined.
