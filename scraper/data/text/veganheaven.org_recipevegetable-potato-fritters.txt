Ingredients:
3/4 cup red lentils
1 small red onion, chopped
2  cloves of garlic
2  medium-sized potatoes (raw)
1  medium-sized carrot
5 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika powder
1 teaspoon regular paprika powder
1 teaspoon majoram
salt
black pepper, to taste
3 tablespoons vegan mayonnaise
1 teaspoon tomato paste
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika powder
salt
black pepper, to taste
sriracha sauce, to taste

Instructions:
Cook the red lentils according to the instructions on the package. Peel and grate the potatoes and the carrot.
In a large bowl, combine them with the cooked red lentils, the garlic, the onion, the flour, and the spices and stir well.
Heat some oil in a large pan, and add about 1 1/2 heaped tablespoons for each fritter. Cook them on medium heat in a son-sticky pan for three to four minutes on each side. Alternatively, you can also make them in the oven for an oil-free version (about 20 minutes, flipping halfway).
For the vegan sriracha mayonnaise, combine all ingredients and stir well.
Serve the fritters with a green salad and the sriracha mayonnaise. Enjoy!
