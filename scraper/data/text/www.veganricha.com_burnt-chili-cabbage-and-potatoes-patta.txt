Ingredients:
2 cups cabbage finely chopped
1  medium potato chopped
2 teaspoons organic canola oil or mustard or sesame oil (any high smoke point oil)
1/2 teaspoon brown mustard seeds
5-6  curry leaves (optional)
1 teaspoon coriander powder
2  dried red chilies (broken into half)
1 teaspoon good quality red chili powder/cayenne
a generous pinch of asafoetida (hing, optional)
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
1 Tablespoon of split lentils of choice (urad dal-black gram, chana-bengal gram or petite yellow lentils (mung dal))
2/3 teaspoon salt or to taste

Instructions:
In a large pan, add oil and heat at medium. Add mustard seeds when hot and mix for a few seconds. Add asofetida(hing), curry leaves, broken red chilies and chili powder and cook for 1-2 minutes.
The chilis and power should start to turn dark. A good indication is that you will start to sneeze :). Use the exhaust.
Add the lentils/daals, turmeric and coriander powder and 2 teaspoons of water. Mix and cook for 30 seconds. Add the potatoes and mix well to coat. Cook for a minute.
Add cabbage and salt and mix well. Cook covered on medium heat for 3-4 minutes. Stir once in between.
Lower the heat to low-medium and cook covered for 15 to 20 minutes or until the potatoes are tender. Cook on medium high heat for 2 minutes to char the cabbage a bit(optional).
For variations, add peas, chopped carrots, bell peppers, other veggies to the cabbage. Or change up the spices, use cumin seeds or fennel or just a little garam masala.
Serve hot topped with fresh cilantro or coconut flakes, as a side with lentil Daal and Roti or Naan-Indian flat bread or Rice.
