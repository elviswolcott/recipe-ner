Ingredients:
4 Tablespoon of chickpea flour ((garbanzo bean flour/besan))
1 Tablespoon oats ((omit this if you dont have glutenfree oats))
1 Tablespoon rice flour
2/3 teaspoon salt (or to taste)
pinch of turmeric
pinch of asofetida ((hing))
1 teaspoon oil
1/2 teaspoon chili flakes or to taste (or 1 green chili)
1/4 teaspoon cumin powder
1/4 teaspoon carom seeds ((Ajwain))
1/2 inch piece of ginger
3-4  mint leaves or cilantro leaves
4-5 Tablespoons water
1  apple chopped into long slices/fries
Oil for frying

Instructions:
In a blender combine all ingredients except apples and oil to fry.
Blend into a thick pasty puree/batter( adjust water and chickpea flour to get the thick consistency, water needed will depend on the flours used). For a simpler batter, just mix chickpea flour, 1/2 tsp garam masala powder, salt and pepper, or use your favorite onion fritter batter.
Drop apple slices into the batter and mix well to coat.
Fry in medium-high hot oil for 2-3 minutes, turning occasionally till the batter becomes darker than its color, golden brown.
Serve hot with ketchup or cilantro Chutney. Top with Chaat masala or rock salt and some red chili powder for added fun. Happy Sunday!
