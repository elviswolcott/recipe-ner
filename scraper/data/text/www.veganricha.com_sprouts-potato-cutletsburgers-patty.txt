Ingredients:
2 medium potato (boiled and mashed)
1 cup mung bean sprouts or any other sprouts you like. (( I sprouted the green mung for 2 days so the sprout was about 1/4 inch))
1  Serrano Chili pepper finely chopped
1/2 cup cilantro leaves finely chopped
1 teaspoon ginger paste
1 teaspoon garlic paste
1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon coriander powder
1/4 teaspoon cumin powder
1/4 teaspoon rock salt ((kala namak))
1/2 cup bread crumbs or 1 slice bread toasted and coarsely blended.
1/4 cup flour
2 tablespoons oil

Instructions:
In a large bowl, add in all the ingredients except flour and mix well.
Try to make patties out of the mixture. If the mixture is too soggy, then add the flour and more bread crumbs.
Shallow fry the patties on medium heat for 2-3 minutes each side.
Serve hot with cilantro chutney and sweet tamarind chutney!
I also made some sandwiches with the patties topped with cilantro chutney, some cherry tomatoes, lettuce and some dijon mustard. Enjoy!
