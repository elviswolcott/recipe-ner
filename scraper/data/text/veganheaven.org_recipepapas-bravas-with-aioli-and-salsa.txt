Ingredients:
35 oz russet potatoes
1 teaspoon smoked paprika powder
1 teaspoon regular paprika powder
2 tablespoons olive oil
salt
1  red onion, finely chopped
2  cloves of garlic, minced
red pepper flakes
2 cups diced tomatoes (drain most of the liquid)
1 tablespoon sherry vinegar
salt
pepper
1/2 cup vegan mayonnaise
1-2  cloves of garlic, minced

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 Â°F. Peel the potatoes and cut them into cubes. Place them in a bowl and toss them with the remaining ingredients for the papas bravas. Place them onto a baking tray and bake for 25 minutes until they're crispy and brown.
In the meantime, make the salsa and the vegan aioli. For each recipe, combine all the listed ingredients in a bowl.
Serve the papas bravas with the salsa and the aioli and sprinkle fresh parsley, green onions, and red pepper flakes on top. Enjoy!
