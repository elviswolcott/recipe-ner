Ingredients:
2 cloves garlic (minced)
1/4 cup chopped onion
1/2  red bell pepper (chopped)
1/2 cup Split red lentils (use 1/3 cup if you like less lentilly chili )
15 oz can black beans or 1.5 cups cooked beans
1 tbsp chili powder blend
1/2 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp ground oregano
1/2 tsp onion powder
2 cups diced canned tomatoes (or fresh tomatoes. If using fresh tomatoes, add in 1 tbsp of tomato paste as well.)
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp black pepper
2 tbsp maple syrup
2 tbsp oil
3/4 cup non-dairy milk (Such as almond , oat, soy or light coconut)
1 tsp vinegar
1/2 cup all purpose flour
3/4 cup Medium grain cornmeal (or fine grain or grits)
1 tbsp cornstarch or tapioca starch
1/2 tsp salt
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
2 tbsp chopped pickled jalapaneo
1/4 to 1/3 cup of vegan cheddar shreds (or use 1-2 tbsp nutritional yeast)
1  jalapeno thinly sliced for topping

Instructions:
In a 9x9 casserole dish, add all of the ingredients under "for the chili" and mix well. Add 1 1/2 cups of water and mix in, and even out the mixture
Place in a pre-heated oven at 400 degrees F, and cook for 35 minutes. Meanwhile make your cornbread mixture, and keep ready.
Mix all your dry ingredients, cornmeal, salt, baking powder, baking soda, and cornstarch in a bowl, then add in the wet ingredients and mix well.
Add in your pickled Jalapenos and cheddar shreds and mix, and let the mixture sit for five minutes to see if you need more non-dairy milk.
Take the chili casserole out of the oven and the lentils by now should be al dente, or just about done.There should be barely any liquid in the mixture. If it's too liquidy, then bake for another 10 minutes.
-Spread the cornbread mixture over the casserole, and even it out with a spatula, spread the sliced jalapenos on top.
Put the casserole back in the oven to bake for another 25-30 minutes, check if the cornbread is done in the center and the sides are startng to turn golden, thats when the casserole is done.
Take the casserole out and cool for 5-10 minutes, and just take large helpings and enjoy!
