Ingredients:
1/3 cup smooth almond butter
1/3 cup maple syrup
1/4 cup non-dairy milk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons oil
3/4 cup oats
3/4 cup flour (I use all-purpose flour, use gf blend or oat flour for Glutenfree )
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/3 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup chocolate chips or chocolate chunks
10-11  soft dates (soaked in hot water for 15 minutes)
1 tablespoon almond butter
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon maple syrup
1/2 cup  non-dairy milk
1/4 cup shredded coconut
1/4 cup chocolate chips

Instructions:
In a bowl, add the almond butter, maple syrup, vanilla, and oil. Heat the non-dairy milk until it&#039;s hot and then add to the bowl. Mix until all of these wet ingredients are well combined.
Then add in the oats, flour, baking soda, salt, and chocolate chips and mix well.
Line a 8 by 8 inch pan or a similar baking dish with parchment paper and press this mixture into the baking pan. Even it out with a spatula. Put in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180C) for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, make your date caramel. Drain the dates and blend with almond butter, salt, and maple syrup. Add 2-3 tablespoons of milk initially and add more if needed. Blend until it's a smooth mixture.
Take the baking pan out of the oven and spread the date caramel all over. Even out with a spatula.
Top it with the coconut and chocolate chips and put it back to bake for another 15-20 Â minutes or until the top is golden to preference.
Remove the pan from the oven and let it cool for 10 minutes before removing it from the pan and cool for another 10 minutes before slicing.
The bars will keep in the counter for a day and in the refrigerator for up to 10 days.
