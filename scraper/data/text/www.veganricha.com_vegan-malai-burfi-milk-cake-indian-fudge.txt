Ingredients:
6 tbsp vegan cream cheese (,kite hill plain almond works best, as fresh as possible (see note to make your own))
2.5 tbsp vegan butter
9 to 11 tbsp sugar (fine sugar) ((Indian desserts are sweet. Use a tbsp or so less for less sweet))
1/2 cup + 1 to 2 tbsp almond flour ((blanched no skin works best))
1 tbsp coconut flour (. optional , add more almond flour if needed)
1/2 tsp ground cardamom
seeds from 1 cardamom pod (, crushed lightly or chopped)
1/8 tsp salt
raw pistachio or almond slivers for garnish

Instructions:
Mix &amp; Whip the cream cheese and vegan butter with a spoon, until well mixed and slightly fluffy. Add sugar and whip again.
Add the 1/2 cup almond flour, coconut flour, cardamom, salt and mix well. Let the mixture sit for a few minutes&nbsp; to thicken before adding more almond flour. You want it to be just about stiff. Taste and adjust sweetness and cardamom. At this point try to not eat all of it.
Chill for 5-10 mins, then spread the mixture on parchment. Using another parchment paper on top, even it out and make into a 1/4 inch thick rectangle.
Chill again for 15 mins, slice and separate slices a bit. Press chopped pistachios on the slices.
Bake at 275 degrees F for 8 to 10 mins. Let cool, then chill for another hour before serving. Store refrigerated for upto 3 days.&nbsp;
