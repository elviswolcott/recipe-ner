Ingredients:
1 cup risotto rice
1 tablespoon olive oil
1  small onion
4 cups brown button mushrooms
1 1/2 cups dried mushrooms
2  cloves of garlic, minced
3/4 cup white wine
2 1/2  cups vegetable broth
3 tablespoons nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon white miso paste
1 tablespoon almond butter
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste
1-2 tablespoons chopped parsley
on the vine cherry tomatoes
Italian spice mixture

Instructions:
Soak the dried mushrooms with one cup of hot water. Let it soak for about 5 minutes. Slice the fresh button mushrooms. 
Finely chop the onion. 
Drain the dried mushrooms and keep the liquid you soaked them in for later. Roughly chop them. 
Heat some oil in a large pan and sauté the onion for about 2-3 minutes until it becomes translucent. 
Add the mushrooms (fresh plus soaked) and the garlic and cook for 3 minutes on high heat. Add the rice and cook for another 2 minutes. 
Deglaze with white wine and allow the wine to evaporate. Once the wine has cooked into the rice, add the water you soaked the mushrooms in. Turn down the heat to a simmer and slowly keep adding the vegetable broth, allowing each amount to be absorbed before you add the next. This will take about 15-20 minutes, depending on the rice you use. If needed add more vegetable broth.
Meanwhile, make the roasted cherry tomatoes. Place the cherry tomatoes in a baking dish and lightly drizzle them with olive oil, salt, and Italian spices. 
Preheat the oven to 350 °F and bake the cherry tomatoes for 10 minutes. 
Stir in the nutritional yeast, the white miso paste, and the almond butter. Season with salt and black pepper. 
Sprinkle with freshly chopped parsley and serve with the roasted tomatoes.
