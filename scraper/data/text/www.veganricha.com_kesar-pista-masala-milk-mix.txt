Ingredients:
2 tbsp raw pistachio
1 tbsp raw cashews
3 tbsp sugar (or add sweetener of choice later)
1/4 tsp cinnamon
1/4 to 1/2 tsp cardamom powder
1/8 tsp cloves
1/8 tsp fennel seeds (optional)
1/4 tsp ground ginger
1/4 tsp black pepper
1/4 tsp poppy seeds
8 to 10  strands of saffron

Instructions:
Grind the nuts to a coarse powder. Add sugar and the rest of the ingredients and grind until well blended.
Store in an airtight container.
Blend 2 Tbsp or more of the mix with a cup of non dairy milk. Use a blender. Taste and adjust sweet if needed. Chill the blended mixture for a few minutes so the saffron gets some time to infuse the drink. Serve as is or with a dollop of whipped coconut cream.
