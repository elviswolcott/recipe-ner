Warm the Non-Dairy Milk in a bowl. Add the oats, chia seeds, cinnamon, vanilla extract, maple syrup, and mix well. Let this mixture sit for 15 to 20 minutes so it thickens a little bit.

To candy pecans, add the pecans to a skillet over medium heat, and cook for 2-3 minutes to slightly roast. Then add the maple syrup, sugar, and a pinch of salt, and mix well. Cook until the sugary mixture starts to thicken, and coats all the pecans. Remove from the heat.
