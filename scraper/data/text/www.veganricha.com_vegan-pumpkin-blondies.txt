Ingredients:
1/3 cup pumpkin puree ((pure pumpkin puree, not pumpkin pie filling. Use a well filled 1/3 cup.))
1/3 cup smooth nut butter (such as almond, cashew or peanut)
1  tsp vanilla extract
1/4 cup maple syrup
2 to 3 tbsp sugar ((I usually use a mix of coconut and raw sugar))
1 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice
3/4 cup flour ((I use a mix of whole wheat and unbleached all purpose))
1/2 cup almond flour
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 to 2/3 cup additions, like chocolate chips, chopped pecans, dried fruit or other nuts or seeds, (plus more for topping)

Instructions:
In a bowl mix in all the wet ingredients until smooth.&nbsp;
Add 1/2 cup flour and rest of the dry ingredients and mix. The mixture will make a soft cookie dough. Use your hands if needed. Add more flour if needed a tbsp at a time. If the dough is too dry, add a tablespoon of pumpkin puree. Add the chocolate chips and pecans and mix them in.
Press the dough into a lined brownie pan using a spatula to evenly spread. Sprinkle and press some chocolate chips and pecan/nuts on top.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 21 to 23 minutes.&nbsp;Allow to cool completely and slice.&nbsp;
To bake into cookies, chill the dough for 10 minutes, form balls and flatten well on a lined baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes, a minute less for smalle and a minute longer for larger cookies.&nbsp;
