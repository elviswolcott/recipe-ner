Ingredients:
1 bottle  red wine ((25.4 oz))
2 tablespoons brown rum
2  oranges, cut into slices
2  juice of two oranges
5  cloves
2  cinnamon sticks
2  star aniseed
1/2 cup brown sugar

Instructions:
Combine all ingredients in a saucepan and stir well.
Heat it up for a couple of minutes over very low heat. Make sure not boil the mulled wine because then the alcohol will evaporate and it won't taste right.
Strain through a sieve and serve hot in heat-resistant glasses or mugs.
