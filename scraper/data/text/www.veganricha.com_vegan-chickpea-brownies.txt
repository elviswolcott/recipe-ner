Ingredients:
1/3 cup non dairy milk (such as almond or coconut or soy)
3 tbsp maple syrup
1/2 cup vegan chocolate chips
15 oz can chickpeas  (drained, or 1.5 cups cooked)
3/4 cup nut butter such as peanut, almond or cashew (or use sunbutter to make nut-free)
5 tbsp coconut sugar or other sugar (, use 7-8 tbsp for sweeter)
3 tbsp cocoa powder
1/4 cup almond flour (, see note for nutfree)
2 tsp vanilla extract
1/8 to 1/4 tsp salt, depends on if the nut butter and chickpeas are already salted
3/4 tsp baking powder
4 tbsp vegan chocolate chips for folding in and for topping

Instructions:
Heat the non dairy milk and maple syrup in a skillet or microwave until just about boiling. Take off heat. Add the chocolate chips. Mix until melted and smooth and set aside. Line a brownie pan with parchment. Preheat the oven to 350 deg F (180 C).
Add chickpeas, nutbutter, coconut sugar, cocoa, vanilla, salt and baking powder to a food processor. Process for half a minute. (The nut butter might not fully incorporate, which is ok)
Add the warm melted chocolate + milk mix (from step 1), almond flour and process again until smooth and even mixture.  Add a tbsp more milk if too thick. (Or add 2 tbsp oil for chewier result)
Fold in 2 tbsp chocolate chips into the batter. Transfer the batter immediately to the parchment lined brownie pan. Spread using a spatula. to even out the top as much as possible. (This batter doesnt melt like regular brownie, so the uneven top will bake uneven. and not even out during baking). Sprinkle some chocolate chips on top.&nbsp;
Bake at 350 F for 35 to 40 mins.  Cool for 10 mins then slice and serve with whipped coconut cream or vanilla ice cream. Store on the counter for the day and refrigerate for upto 5 days. Freeze for upto a month
