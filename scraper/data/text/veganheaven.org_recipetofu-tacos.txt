Ingredients:
21 oz firm or extra-firm tofu
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup unsweetened almond or soy milk
1/4 cup water
2 teaspoon paprika powder
1 cup panko bread crumbs
1 cup Frank&#039;s Red Hot Buffalo Wings sauce
1 tablespoon olive oil
1  small romain lettuce
1/4  small red cabbage
1  avocado
1  lime
1 cup corn (frozen or canned)
6  medium corn or flour tortillas
1 cup unsweetened coconut or soy yogurt
1-2  cloves of garlic, minced
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste

Instructions:
Drain the tofu and pat it dry with a paper towel. Cut it into sticks or cubes. In a large bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, the plant-based milk, the water, the paprika powder, the salt, and the black pepper.
Stir until well combined.
Dip the tofu sticks or cubes into the batter, so they’re completely coated. Then roll them in the panko breadcrumbs.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and lay the tofu cubes or sticks on the baking sheet. Don’t put them on top of each other. Bake for 25 minutes at 350 F.
Combine Frank’s Red Hot Buffalo Wings sauce with a tablespoon of olive oil and pour it over the baked tofu. Evenly coat it from all sides by carefully stirring them a few times.
Put the coated tofu back on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake again for 20 minutes at 350 F.
Roughly chop the lettuce and the red cabbage. Slice the avocado. Make the yogurt sauce: in a small bowl combine the plant-based yogurt, the minced garlic, salt, and pepper. Stir well. 
Once the baking time is over, reheat the store-bought tortillas in a skillet (30 seconds per side) or in the microwave (30 seconds on high). Arrange everything in the tortillas and drizzle the yogurt sauce on top. Sprinkle with freshly chopped cilantro and lime juice. Serve immediately!
