Ingredients:
1 cup raw cashews
1 cup peeled and chopped yellow or white potato (1-2 potatoes)
8 ounces canned green chiles, mild or medium
2 tablespoons pickled jalapeños
2 tablespoons pickled jalapeño juice from the jar
2 tablespoons lemon juice (about 1 lemon squeezed)
1 cup water
1 teaspoon salt

Instructions:
In a small pot, add the cashews and diced potatoes, then cover with water. Bring to a boil and cook for about 10 minutes, until the potatoes are fork tender.
Drain the cashews and potatoes and add to a blender along with the remaining ingredients. Blend until smooth and creamy. If you have a Vitamix or similar blender, you can simply blend it until hot, without needing to warm it in a pot.
If you have a regular blender or prefer to warm it on the stovetop, pour the mixture into a small/medium pot and stir frequently over medium heat until hot. It will thicken as it heats up, so add more water as desired to thin the cheese sauce.
Serve with tortilla chips, in tacos, burritos, bowls or with any other Mexican inspired meal. Enjoy!
