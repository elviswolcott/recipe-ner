Ingredients:
1/2 cup non dairy milk ( such as almond or soy)
1/3 cup pumpkin puree
4 tbsp sugar
1 tsp active yeast
2 tbsp safflower or refined coconut oil
1 tsp vanilla extract ((1/2 to 1 tsp to flavor preference))
1 tsp pumpkin pie spice
a generous pinch of nutmeg
3/4 cup  unbleached all purpose flour (+ 1 to 2 tbsp more as needed )
2 tbsp almond flour  (or use 1 tbsp more flour)
1 tsp baking powder
 tsp salt
1 tsp cinnamon
4 tbsp cane sugar  (or granulated sugar)

Instructions:
Grease the donut pan. Warm the non dairy milk until hot. Mix with the rest of the ingredients except yeast and mix well until sugar is combined. Add the yeast and mix in.&nbsp;
In a bowl, mix 3/4 cup flour and rest of the dry ingredients. Add the flour mix to the wet and mix in. Add a tbsp or so more flour if needed (if the mix is runny). Let the mixture sit for 10-15 minutes.
Spoon into greased donut pan. You can also fill up a ziplock, cut one end and squeeze the batter into the pan. Let the pan sit for another 10 minutes for the batter to rise, Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
Bake for 11 to 12 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes then remove from pan.
Add cinnamon and sugar to a small ziplock bag and mix. Take the warm donuts, add to the ziplock, shake. Remove from the ziplock and serve. You can also use a bowl to make the cinnamon sugar topping, and dip the donuts in the bowl to coat. The warm donuts are moist enough so the topping should stick. If you'd like more topping, brush oil on the donuts before dipping.&nbsp;
