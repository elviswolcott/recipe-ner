Ingredients:
1/2 cup oat flour (certified gluten-free if needed *, or use regular flour)
1 cup cooked chickpeas (drained if using canned)
2 tbsp coconut oil (refined if you dont want the coconut flavor)
1/3 cup nut butter such as peanut (almond or cashew, or use sunbutter to make nut-free)
2 tbsp maple syrup
3 to 4 tbsp coconut sugar or other sugar
2 tsp vanilla extract
1/8 to 1/4 tsp salt (depends on if the nut butter and chickpeas are already salted)
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp ground cinnamon (optional)
1/2 cup vegan chocolate chips or chunks

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F / 180c.
Add all the ingredients except chocolate chips to a food processor. Process for half a minute, scrape sides and process again until smooth. Taste and adjust sweet if needed. (If the mixture is too stiff, add a tbsp or more aquafaba or non dairy milk and blend in. See pictures for texture).
Reserve a tbsp of chocolate chips for garnish. Fold in the rest of the chocolate chips into the thick batter in the processor.
Grease or line an 8 inch or smaller cake pan. Transfer the batter onto the pan and spread it out using a spatula. Sprinkle chocolate chips on top.
Bake for 22 to 26 minutes or until the center looks set. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then slice and serve with dollop of vegan vanilla ice cream or whipped coconut cream, and melted chocolate or vegan caramel.
