Ingredients:
2 tsp oil
1/2 tsp cumin seeds
3/4 cup onion ((chopped))
1 inch ginger ((finely chopped))
5 cloves of garlic ((finely chopped))
1  hot green chilli ((such as serrano - finely chopped))
1 tsp turmeric
1/2 tsp garam masala
1 tsp ground coriander
1/2 tsp smoked paprika
1 large tomato ((diced))
1 large eggplant ((peeled and cubed into small about half an inch cubes))
3/4 tsp salt
1/2 cup water
1/3 cup peas
1/4 cup cilantro

Instructions:
Set your instant pot to sauté, once it has heated up, add&nbsp;oil. Let the oil heat up and add the cumin seeds. Cook for half a minute. Add the onion, ginger, garlic, green chili and a good pinch of salt. Cook for 3 minutes.
Add all the ground spices and mix well. Then add the tomato and allow to cook for 2 minutes. Mash the larger pieces of tomato and deglaze with a tbsp of water if needed.
Once the tomato is tender, add the eggplant, salt, water and give it a good mix. Cancel sauté mode, close the lid, then pressure cook for 9-10 minutes. Let the pressure release naturally.
Open the lid and mash the eggplants really well using a potato masher. Taste and adjust the salt and flavor as needed. Add 1/2 teaspoon of liquid smoke for additional smoky flavor. Press sauté mode and cook for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, (cook a few mins longer for thicker and more roasted)&nbsp; then add the peas and cilantro and mix in. Cancel sauté.
Serve hot and garnish with additional cilantro, pepper flakes and sprinkle smoked paprika.
