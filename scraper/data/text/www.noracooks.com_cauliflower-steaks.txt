Ingredients:
2 large heads cauliflower
1/4 cup olive oil
spray oil
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup vegan mayo
1/4 cup Thai sweet chili sauce
2 teaspoons Sriracha hot sauce
2 teaspoon pure maple syrup or agave

Instructions:
Preheat your oven to 450 degrees and grease two large baking sheets with olive oil. Add the seasonings to a small bowl, stir and set aside.
Pull off the green leaves from the heads of the cauliflower and trim the very bottom of the stem, but not too much as you need some to hold the &quot;steaks&quot; together. Slice each head into 3/4-1 inch thick slices. The outer slices will just fall apart, and you can roast these alongside the steaks if youâ€™d like, or save and use them in another recipe or salads. You will probably get about 3 steaks from 1 head of cauliflower.
Arrange the steaks in a single layer on the prepared baking sheets. Place the extra florets around the edges, if desired.
Spray the tops with oil and sprinkle with half the seasonings. Turn them over, carefully and sprinkle the other side with the seasonings. You can use your fingers to rub the spices into the crevices as well for more flavor.
Roast the cauliflower in the center rack of the oven for 15 minutes, then carefully use a spatula to flip each steak, then cook for another 10-15 minutes. They are done when they are golden on both sides, tender and a bit crisp.
