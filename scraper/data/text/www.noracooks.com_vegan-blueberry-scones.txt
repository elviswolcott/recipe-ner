Ingredients:
2 cups all purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 tablespoon ground flaxseeds
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup granulated sugar
8 tablespoons cold vegan butter ((or solid coconut oil))
3/4 cup almond milk ((soy or coconut milk fine))
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
3/4-1 cup fresh blueberries ((may use frozen as well))
OPTIONAL: lemon zest from 1 lemon
1 cup powdered sugar
2 tablespoons almond milk
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, ground flaxseeds, salt and sugar.
Add the cold vegan butter, and use a pastry cutter or your hands to work the butter into the dry ingredients. It should resemble coarse crumbs.
Pour in the milk and vanilla, and stir until just combined. Fold in the blueberries.
On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough a few times until it comes together. Flatten the dough with your hands (lightly flour your hands if sticky). Flatten it into a circle, about 1 inch thick.
Using a pizza cutter or large knife, cut it like you would a pizza, into 8 pieces.
Place the scones onto the prepared baking sheet and bake for 22-26 minutes, until lightly golden brown on top.
