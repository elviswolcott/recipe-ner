Ingredients:
Bunch  Green Beans (2 to 3 cups, chopped into 3 to 4 inch size)
2 tsp oil
3 cloves of garlic (finely chopped)
3-4 tbsp red curry paste (use a fish free brand)
2 tsp soy sauce (or use coconut aminos + some tamarind paste to make soy-free)
1 tsp lemon or lime juice
1 tbsp kaffir lime leaves or zest of half a lime
3 tbsp water or veggie broth
1 1/2-2 tsp sugar
1/4 tsp or more cayenne or to taste
a dash of salt

Instructions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Blanch the green beans for 2 minutes, drain and keep aside. If using thinner beans like haricot verts, blanch for 1 minute.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium low heat. Add garlic and cook until translucent. 2 minutes.
Add the red curry paste and mix and cook until fragrant . 1 minute.
Add the soy sauce, lemon, lime leaves or zest, water, sugar, cayenne and salt and mix well. Increase heat to medium. Cook for a minute.
Add the green beans. toss to coat. Cover and cook for 3 to 6 minutes or until tender to preference.
Taste and adjust salt, sweet, and spice. I added some red pepper flakes as the curry paste I use is not hot. Serve hot with rice or noodles or cooked grains of choice. The beans can also be garnished with crushed peanuts or almonds and cilantro.
