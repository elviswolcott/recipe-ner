Ingredients:
200 grams king oyster mushroom stems
1 tablespoon light soy sauce
1/4 teaspoon dark brown sugar
1 pinch ground five-spice
1 pinch mushroom bouillion/extract
1 tablespoon white sesame seeds (optional)
shredded nori (optional)

Instructions:
Prepare the Mushroom Floss. First, cut off the king oyster mushroom caps. Note: In this picture, I am using mini king oyster mushrooms but regular-sized ones work perfectly too. Just be sure you shred the stems as finely as possible.
Let the mushroom stems soak in warm water for around 5 minutes (to soften). After 5 minutes, take the mushroom stems out of the water and squeeze out the liquid absorbed by them.
Using a fork, shred each stem finely.
Add the shredded mushroom stems into a pan, and heat the pan up on high heat to draw out moisture from the mushrooms. Be sure to pay attention to the mushroom shreds so they don't burn. This is also a good time to pre-heat the oven to 400 degrees F (204 degrees C).
Once the moisture has mostly evaporated, add the soy sauce, brown sugar, five-spice, mushroom boullion, and cook for one more minute. Spread the shredded mushroom stems on a parchment-lined baking tray and bake for 12-14 minutes, or until dry and crumbly.
At the end of the baking process, the mushroom floss should look like this. At this point, you can toss the floss with any additional ingredients such as shredded nori and white sesame seeds. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Enjoy within 2 weeks.
