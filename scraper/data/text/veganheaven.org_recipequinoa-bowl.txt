Ingredients:
1 cup quinoa
2  carrots, cut into thin strips/sticks
1  red bell pepper, cut into thin strips
2 cups thinly sliced red cabbage
2  green onions, cut into rings
1/2 cup roughly chopped cilantro
1 cup frozen edamame
1/2  cucumber, cut into cubes
1/4 cup roasted peanuts
1/4 cup natural, unsweetened peanut butter
juice from 1 lime
1 teaspoon maple syrup
2 teaspoons soy sauce
red pepper flakes, to taste
1  clove of garlic, minced
3-4 tablespoons water
1/2 teaspoon sriracha (optional)
1 teaspoon sesame oil

Instructions:
Cook the quinoa. Either use the instructions on the package to cook it on the stovetop or cook it in the Instant Pot. I usually cook it for 1 minute on high pressure with natural pressure release for 12 minutes. 
While the quinoa is cooking, chop up the vegetables. Cut the carrots, the bell pepper, and the red cabbage into thin strips and the cucumber into cubes. Cook the frozen edamame in boiling water as directed on the package. 
Make the peanut sauce. Combine all of the ingredients in a small bowl and stir well. 
Serve the cooked quinoa with the vegetables and the peanut in a bowl and sprinkle it with roughly chopped peanuts.
