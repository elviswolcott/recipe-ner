Ingredients:
1 cup cooked rice (I used parboiled rice)
1 cup black beans
4  flour tortillas
2 teaspoons tomato paste
1 teaspoon cumin
1/2 cup vegan cheese to sprinkle on top
1 cup canned diced tomatoes
1 teaspoon cumin
1 teaspoon paprika powder
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste
red pepper flakes, to taste
1  avocado
4  mini sweet peppers
fresh parsley or cilantro
1/4 cup vegan sour cream
red pepper flakes

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 Â°F.
First make the taco cups: They're actually made of tortillas. You can either use a really wide glass (about 3.5 inches wide) or a large cookie cutter. Then just use a sharp knife to cut out the taco cups. Place each of them in a muffin cup and press them into the cup. You can either use your fingers or a smaller glass to do that. If they're too hard, you can put them on a plate and place them in the microwave for about 20 seconds to make them softer. But for me it worked without putting them in the microwave.
Next make the spiced rice. In a medium-sized pan, heat some oil and add the cooked rice together with the tomato paste and the cumin. Stir well and cook for about 2-3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
For the salsa, combine all ingredients in a small bowl.
Fill the taco cups with the rice, black beans, the salsa, and top it with some vegan cheese. Bake them for 15 minutes.
Let them cool off a bit and then add sliced avocado, mini sweet peppers, fresh parsley or cilantro, and vegan sour cream on top. Sprinkle with some red pepper flakes and enjoy!
