Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups almond milk
2 teaspoons baking powder
2 tablespoons melted coconut oil or canola oil
1 pinch salt
2 teaspoons natural vanilla extract
3 tablespoons coconut sugar or brown sugar
2 tablespoons unsweetened apple sauce

Instructions:
Combine all ingredients for the vegan waffles in a medium bowl.
Using a hand whisk, stir well until all lumps are removed.&nbsp;The batter will be quite thin. Don't worry, that's normal!
Heat your waffle maker and grease it with coconut oil or canola oil on both sides (top and bottom). Pour the batter with a ladle into the waffle iron. It depends on your waffle maker how much batter you need, so check the manufacturer instructions.
Close your waffle maker and bake the waffles for about 5 minutes until they're golden and crispy on the outside. Don't open the waffle maker too early.
Serve the waffles immediately with maple syrup and berries or other fruits. Enjoy!
