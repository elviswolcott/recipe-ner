Ingredients:
14 oz very firm tofu
1  chipotle in adobo sauce (canned)
2 tablespoons adobo sauce (from the canned chipotle)
3  cloves of garlic
2 teaspoons cumin
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika powder
1  green bell pepper, roughly chopped
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1  tomato, quartered
3/4 cup salsa
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons tomato paste

Instructions:
Drain the tofu. Wrap it in paper towels and squeeze out as much of the excess water as possible. Cut it into slices
In a large non-stick frying pan, heat some oil and cook the tofu on high heat until it&#039;s nicely browned on both sides. This should take about 8 minutes. 
In the meantime, make the marinade. Place all of ingredients into a food processor or blender and process them into a sauce with a few chunks left. It should look like a salsa. 
When the tofu is nicely browned, use a wooden spoon to crumble it. The crumbles shouldn&#039;t be too small.
Add the sauce to the tofu. 
Stir well. 
Simmer for 15 minutes on medium heat.
Serve with burritos, tacos, or in a burrito bowl with brown rice, lettuce, guacamole, and vegan sour cream.
