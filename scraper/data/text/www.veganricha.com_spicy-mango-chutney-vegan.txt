Ingredients:
1 teaspoon organic high fat oil (I used organic canola. coconut would work too)
1  diced champagne mango  (or large mango preferably very ripe)
1/2 inch ginger grated
1/2 teaspoon red chili flakes or 1 broken dry red chili (adjust to taste)
1 clove garlic chopped
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 Tablespoons cider vinegar or white vinegar
2 Tablespoon Raw sugar or equivalent jaggery or packed brown sugar or other sweetener. (adjust to taste less or more)
2 Tablespoons golden raisins
1/8 teaspoon each of cinnamon

Instructions:
In a large non stick or non-reactive pot, add oil and heat on low, swirl to spread on the bottom.
Add all ingredients and mix well.
Cook on medium-low heat and bring to a rolling boil, reduce heat to low and simmer until thick, about 25 minutes.
Stir frequently to keep from sticking.
Taste for sweet, sour, spice levels, adjust spices, mix well and take off heat after another minute.
Let cool before canning.
