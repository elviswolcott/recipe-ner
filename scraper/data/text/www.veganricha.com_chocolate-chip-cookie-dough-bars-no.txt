Ingredients:
2 Tbsp solid coconut oil
2 Tbsp almond milk  (or other non dairy milk)
1/4 cup Coconut palm Sugar ( or brown sugar)
1 Tbsp pure vanilla extract (use 2 tsp for less intense flavor)
1/4 tsp salt
3/4 cup Oat Flour (certified gf finely ground Oats , or use any mild tasting grain flour/white flour)
3/4 cup Almond flour/fine Meal
1/4 cup ground raw sugar (use less for less sweet)
1/3 to 1/2 cup vegan Enjoy Life mini chocolate chips (or vegan dark chocolate chunks by Theo to make palm oil-free.)

Instructions:
Melt the coconut oil by heating in a pan or bowl. Whisk in the almond milk, coconut sugar and vanilla until well combined.
Add the flours, salt, and ground sugar and mix. Taste and adjust sweet if needed, or add more flour or oil for the soft sticky, but not too sticky dough. Do not add too much flour as the do set and dry out as they chill. Fold in the chocolate chips and mix.
Press onto a parchment sheet and shape into a 1/2 inch thick rectangle (about 8 by 7 inch size) and Refrigerate until set. Cut the bars and store in an airtight container in the fridge, if there are any going to be left for the next day :). Eat as is, or Add these to ice creams, morning oatmeal or chia pudding, shakes, and what not.
