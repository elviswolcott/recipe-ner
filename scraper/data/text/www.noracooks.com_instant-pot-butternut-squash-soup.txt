Ingredients:
1-2 tablespoons olive oil or water for oil free
1  small sweet onion, diced
3  cloves garlic, minced or pressed
1  large butternut squash, about 3 pounds, peeled and cut into cubes
1/8  teaspoon nutmeg (freshly grated if possible)
2-3 cups vegetable broth
salt, to taste
1 cup Cashew Cream  (OR 1 cup full fat coconut milk)

Instructions:
Push the &quot;saute&quot; button on the Instant Pot. Add the olive oil (or water), chopped onion and garlic. Saute for 2-3 minutes, then turn the Instant Pot off for a moment.
Add the butternut squash, nutmeg and enough vegetable broth (2-3 cups) to nearly cover the squash. To prevent getting the &quot;burn&quot; message, use a spatula to stir and scrape the bits on onions/garlic off the bottom of the pot. Cover with the lid and seal. Push the &quot;manual&quot; button, and cook on high pressure for 10 minutes.Â 
Once it beeps, carefully release any pressure from the Instant Pot. Using an immersion blender (or regular blender), blend until very smooth. Taste, and add salt as needed.
Now stir in 1 cup of Cashew Cream OR 1 cup of full fat coconut milk. Both work well, but if you don&#x27;t like the taste of coconut, go with cashew cream.
Ladle into bowls and serve warm. You can stir in a little extra cashew cream or coconut milk if desired. Enjoy!
Without an Instant Pot: In a large pot on the stovetop, saute the onion and garlic in olive oil for 2-3 minutes. Now add the vegetable broth, squash and nutmeg. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer for 20-30 minutes until the squash is fork tender. Then, use an immersion blender until smooth. Stir in cashew cream/coconut milk.
