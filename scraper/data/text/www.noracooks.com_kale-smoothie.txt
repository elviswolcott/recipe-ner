Ingredients:
2 cups chopped kale
1 1/2 cups frozen mango chunks
2  medjool dates, pits removed
2 tablespoons hemp, chia or flax seeds
1 lemon, juice squeezed (about 2 tablespoons)
1/2 inch piece fresh ginger, optional
1-1 1/2 cups water

Instructions:
Add all ingredients to a high powered blender and blend until creamy and smooth. Start with 1 cup of water, and if it&#x27;s too thick add the extra 1/2 cup. I tend to enjoy a thinner smoothie so I use the full 1 1/2 cups of water.
Serve immediately. It makes either one large serving, or two smaller servings.
