Ingredients:
1 1/2  cups flour
1/2 cup cocoa powder
1/2 cup vegan chocolate chips
3 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 cup almond milk
3.5 oz dark chocolate
24  oreo cookies ((make sure you have some spare cookies because they break easily))
24  yellow skittles
12  orange skittles

Instructions:
In a large bowl, combine all ingredients. Stir with a wooden spoon until combined. Place baking cups in a muffin pan and divide the mixture evenly.
Bake for about 15 minutes at 360F (180C). In the meantime, melt the dark chocolate. You can either do this in a microwave or in a small sauce pot over the stove.
Coat the chocolate muffins or cupcakes with melted dark chocolate. Then carefully separate the Oreos with a knife and press the halves with the filling onto the melted chocolate to make the eyes. Use yellow skittles for the eyeballs. Again be careful not to break the Oreos. Then make a little hole between the eyes with a knife and add an orange candy nose in the middle.  Then cut ears out of the leftover Oreo halves and tuck them into the top of each chocolate cupcake or muffin behind the eyes. Put the first one on the melted chocolate and the second one on top of the first one. Use some more melted chocolate to glue them together.
