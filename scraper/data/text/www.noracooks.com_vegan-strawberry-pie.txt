Ingredients:
1 recipe Easy Vegan Pie Crust (| OR store bought vegan pie crust)
2 pints (1 quart) strawberries (about 4 cups)
1 cup granulated sugar
3/4 cup water
3 tablespoons cornstarch
1 teaspoon lemon juice
Optional: Coconut Whip Cream (| I used SoDelicious Coco Whip)

Instructions:
Bake the pie crust: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. If using my pie crust recipe, prepare the crust according to instructions and line a 9 inch pie pan with the crust, trimming the edges as needed. Poke all over the bottom with a fork and bake for 15-20 minutes. If worried about the crust puffing up, you can place a piece of parchment paper inside the crust and put about 1 cup of dried beans or rice on top. Let cool for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, wash and hull the strawberries. Slice if desired (I left them whole).
Take 3/4 cup of the strawberries and add to a saucepan. Mash them with a fork or potato masher, then stir in the sugar, water, cornstarch and lemon juice. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently, and cook for 2-3 minutes until thickened. Remove from heat.
Place the rest of the strawberries in the cooked pie crust, pointy side up (for prettiness!). You will probably have 2 layers of strawberries; simply arrange them fairly evenly.
Pour the thickened strawberry sauce into the pie pan with the strawberries, evenly distributing the sauce over the berries.
Chill in the refrigerator for 4-6 hours before serving. The pie will thicken and become sliceable. Serve with a dollop of Coconut Whip Cream if desired and enjoy!
