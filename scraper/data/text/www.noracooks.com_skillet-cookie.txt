Ingredients:
1/2 cup vegan butter or coconut oil
1 cup  brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 tablespoons non-dairy milk
1 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup chocolate chips
1 recipe 3 Ingredient Vegan Caramel Sauce (salt added)
non-dairy vanilla ice cream
more chocolate chips
sprinkle of salt

Instructions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.&nbsp;
In a 10 or 12 inch cast iron pan, melt the vegan butter or coconut oil. Once it's melted, remove from heat and add the brown sugar. Stir well to combine, then add the vanilla and non-dairy milk, and mix until well combined.
Stir in the flour, cornstarch, baking soda and salt. Stir in the chocolate chips, and press evenly into the pan with your hands.
Bake for 15-20 minutes until the edges are golden brown. The inside middle will still be slightly gooey, which is how it should be.&nbsp;
Serve immediately with non-dairy vanilla ice cream, salted caramel sauce, more chocolate chips and a sprinkle of salt, if desired. You can also leave out the caramel sauce for a regular chocolate chip skillet cookie, if you'd like.
