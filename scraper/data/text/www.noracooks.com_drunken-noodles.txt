Cook the noodles according to package instructions. Drain, rinse in cold water and set aside.
Mix all sauce ingredients in a small bowl until combined. Set aside.
In a large skillet or wok, heat the oil over high heat. Add the garlic and cook for about 30 seconds, then add the onion and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly.
Now add the carrots, broccoli and bell pepper to the skillet, and cook for 2 more minutes.
