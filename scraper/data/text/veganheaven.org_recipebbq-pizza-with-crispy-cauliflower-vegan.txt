Ingredients:
1/2  head of cauliflower
1 cup BBQ-sauce
1 teaspoon smoked paprika powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon liquid smoke
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon instant yeast
1 pinch sugar
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 cups lukewarm water
1 cup unsweetened coconut yogurt
2  cloves of garlic, minced
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste

Instructions:
First make the dough. Combine the dry ingredients in a bowl and stir well. Slowly add the olive oil and the warm water. Knead the dough with your hands. Add more water if needed. Form a ball and put it in a bowl that you cover with a cloth or kitchen towel. The best thing about this dough is that is doesn't have to rise for too long. 45 minutes is definitely enough. Maybe you could even get away with 30 minutes if you let the dough rise in a warm place. 
In the meantime, make the BBQ cauliflower. Cut the cauliflower into bite-sized florets. Combine the BBQ sauce with the spices. Use half of the sauce to dip the florets in, so they're completely coated.
Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake for 10 minutes at 350 F.
Get your dough ready. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and gently knead to form two pizzas.
Coat the baked BBQ cauliflower with the remaining sauce and place them on the pizza. Bake for 12-15 minutes or until lightly brown and crispy. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and green onions.
And don't forget the forget the vegan garlic sauce! Just combine the ingredients in a small bowl and pour over the pizza. Enjoy!
