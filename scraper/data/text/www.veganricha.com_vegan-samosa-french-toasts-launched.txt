Ingredients:
2 teaspoons organic canola oil
1  green chili chopped fine
1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds
1/2 teaspoon coriander seeds
1/4 teaspoon fennel seeds (optional)
a generous pinch of asafoetida (hing)
1/4 teaspoon turmeric (haldi (Optional))
1/2 teaspoon garam masala powder/curry powder or to taste
1/2 teaspoon amchur (dry mango powder or Chaat masala powder(or add lemon juice to the potatoes when cooked))
2  medium boiled potatoes. ( Mashed or cubed small.)
1/4 cup green peas (optional)
1/4 cup chopped cilantro
1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste
1/2 teaspoon cumin powder
1/4 teaspoon red chili powder or to taste

Instructions:
Heat oil in a pan. When hot, add the cumin seeds, saute for a few seconds.
Add the fennel or coriander seeds and green chili. Mix for half a minute.
Add the asafoetida, turmeric, garam masala, mix, and add the peas if using, and cook for half a minute.
Add in the boiled potatoes, salt to taste. Cook uncovered for 3-4 minutes.
Add in the amchur or chaat masala, cumin powder, chili powder, cilantro. Mix well, taste, adjust salt and spice(my mom would add a load of red chili powder right about now).
Take off heat.
(You can also make this with uncooked(not boiled) potatoes. Add potatoes and peas together. Add 1/4 cup water and salt, mix and cook covered on low-medium for 14-16 minutes.
Mash the potatoes a bit, add the other spices and cook for another minute or so.)
