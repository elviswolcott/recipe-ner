Ingredients:
2 tablespoons ground flaxseeds
5 tablespoons water
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup soy milk*
zest of 1 orange
2 tablespoons fresh squeezed orange juice
1/2 cup canola oil*
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
2 cups all purpose flour*
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups fresh or frozen cranberries
1 cup powdered sugar
2 tablespoons fresh squeezed orange juice
zest of 1/2 orange, optional
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and grease a standard loaf pan (8 1/2 x 4 1/2 inches or 9 x 5 inches).Â You can also line the pan with parchment paper, leaving some overhang on the sides for easy removal.
In a small bowl, combine the ground flaxseed and water. Set aside to thicken for 3-4 minutes. These are your flax &quot;eggs&quot;.
In a large bowl, whisk together the sugar, soy milk, orange zest, orange juice, oil, flax eggs and vanilla until well combined.
To the bowl with the wet ingredients, add the flour, baking powder and salt. Stir until just combined, being careful not to over mix or your bread may be dense or rubbery.
If the cranberries were frozen, toss them with a tablespoon of flour; this will help them not make the entire loaf red or pink. Gently fold the cranberries in the batter.
Pour into the prepared pan, place in the center rack of the oven and bake for 55-65 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Let the bread cool for 10 minutes in the pan, then carefully transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
Make the glaze: In a small-medium bowl, add the powdered sugar, orange juice, zest and vanilla, and stir with a spoon until smooth. You can use a whisk if you powdered sugar is clumpy.
Once the bread has cooled completely, spread or drizzle the glaze over the top. Serve and enjoy!
