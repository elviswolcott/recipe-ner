Ingredients:
1 tablespoon canola oil
pinch of asofetida ((hing))
1/4 teaspoon mustard seeds
1/4 teaspoon cumin seeds
1/2 teaspoon coriander powder
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
1  Serrano chili pepper finely chopped ((put half if you want it less spicy))
3 cloves garlic finely chopped
1 inch ginger finely chopped
5  curry leaves
3  medium tomatoes chopped
3-4 cups Lauki/Doodhi/Bottle gourd ((peeled and chopped into half inch cubes))
1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste
chopped cilantro for garnish

Instructions:
I cook this curry in a pressure cooker, but you can use a covered pan as well.
In the cooker/pan, heat the oil on medium heat
Add in the asofetida(hing powder) and mustard seeds and wait till they start to splutter.
Add in the cumin seeds and coriander powder and mix well.
Add in the chopped chili peppers and garlic and mix well. Cook until garlic is slightly golden
Add in the ginger and curry leaves and mix for a few seconds.
Add in the tomatoes and salt and let cook for 5-7 minutes until the tomatoes are tender and they pick up the garlicky flavor. you will be able to smell the tomato garlic aroma.
Add in the chopped bottle gourd and mix well. Pressure cook for 2 whistles and switch off.
If cooking in a pan, add in some water with the bottle gourd and cook on medium heat covered until the bottle gourd is soft and easily smashed.
Adjust for salt and spice(chili powder optional) and garnish with cilantro. Serve hot with rotis/ chapatis/Naan or basmati rice!
