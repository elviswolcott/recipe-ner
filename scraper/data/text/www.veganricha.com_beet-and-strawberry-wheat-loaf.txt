Ingredients:
2/3 cup bread flour
2/3 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup water
1.5 teaspoons active yeast
1 teaspoon vital wheat gluten
1  flax egg ((can be substituted for 1 teaspoon vegan butter))
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoons raw sugar
1 tablespoon oil
5-6  large strawberries
1/2  medium beet (peeled and chopped)
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg

Instructions:
Puree the strawberries and beet together using a little water if needed.
Boil the puree with 3 tablespoons raw sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg for 5-6 minutes until it thickens a little. You can use this as pancake topping as well!
Warm 1/4 cup (60ml) water and 1 tablespoon sugar and add yeast to it. Mix well and let sit for 10 minutes.
Add in the flours, salt, vital wheat gluten, flax egg, oil and puree and knead into a soft dough. Knead for at least 5 minutes and use more flour or water if necessary. The syrupy puree will make the dough a bit sticky.
Place dough in a well oiled container where it can double in volume. Spritz top of the dough with oil spray and Cover with damp towel and let rest for 2 hours.
Take dough and shape into a rectangle. Then roll it up and place in bread pan with seam side down. Spritz top with water then oil and cover with damp towel.
Let rise for 45 minutes.
Bake at 375 degrees for 15 minutes, then 350 for another 10 or 15 until bread sounds hollow.
Cool bread completely before slicing!
