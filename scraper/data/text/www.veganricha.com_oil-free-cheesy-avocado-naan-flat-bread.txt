Ingredients:
1/4 cup warm water
1.5 teaspoons yeast
1 teaspoon sugar or maple (or bread flour if using stevia. Add equivalent stevia later with dry ingredients)
1/2 cup bread flour
1/4 cup wheat flour
1 teaspoon onion flakes
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 Tablespoons mashed avocado (about half a regular sized Avocado)
1/4 cup chopped basil
1 Tablespoon nutritional yeast
1  green chili finely chopped (optional)
Seeds for topping: Sesame, Til, Nigella(Kalonji) or Carom(Ajwain)
Add other chopped up greens (spinach, baby kale or herbs(cilantro).)
Add a Tablespoon or evoo or vegan butter.

Instructions:
In a bowl, add warm water, yeast and sugar and mix well.
Let sit 10 minutes or until frothy.
Add all the dry ingredients and avocado and mix.
Knead into a soft dough(3-4 minutes).
Spray water on top, cover with towel and let sit for 1.5 hours or until doubled. Use a bowl with enough space for the dough to double without touching the towel on top.
Add chopped basil, chopped green chili, nutritional yeast and 1-2 Tablespoons wheat flour and knead for a minute to combine well.
Divide dough into 2 parts (for 2 large 10 inch Naans or 3 parts for smaller) and roll into oval shape or shape with your hands by pressing it outwards. Use flour if needed. The hand shaped Naans puff up better.
Use any large pan/skillet which can withstand high heat. Heat it on medium high heat until hot.
Pat some nigella, sesame or carom seeds on top and spritz the bottom with a little water.
Place the naan with bottom on the pan.
Cover and let cook on medium high till it starts to puff.
Flip after 1-1.5 minutes, and cook for half a minute( for pita style)
If you like a charred Naan, then instead of flipping to cook the other side, hold the uncooked side of Naan over the flame with tongs for a few seconds to cook and char some spots.
Serve hot, topped with vegan butter or olive oil with any Indian curry, Daal lentil stews, vegetable Subzis, salad and pickle.
