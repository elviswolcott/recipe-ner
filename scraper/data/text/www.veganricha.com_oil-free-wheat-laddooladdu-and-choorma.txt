Ingredients:
1/4 cup whole wheat flour
2 Tablespoons ground raw sugar (reduce to 1 if you dont like very sweet laddus, or powdered jaggery or sweetner of choice)
2 Tablespoons ground raw almond
1/8 teaspoon cardamom powder
2 Tablespoons Maple syrup (you can try agave or date syrup or any sticky sweet syrup or single thread sugar/jaggery syrup)
few sprays of water

Instructions:
In a pan, dry roast the wheat flour on low heat for 25-30 minutes, stirring every 3 to 4 minutes. You can also roast over medium heat for 6 to 8 minutes. Stir frequently (2-3 times per minute) to avoid burning. Slow roasting however has better flavor.
Once the wheat flour gets lightly browned and you can smell the roasted aroma, add in the ground sugar, cardamom and almond flour and mix well.
Roast for another minute.
Add in the maple syrup, mix well and take off heat.
Spray water on the mix 3-4 times mixing continuously with the spatula and pressing a little to see if a few lumps are formed.
Let it cool slightly till easy to handle, then knead it using you hands for a minute, so the nut oil and the maple incorporate well and help with the sticking.
You can serve this lumpy mix, similar to the wheat choorma as is, or make balls/laddoos out it.
You can add roasted or raw chopped nuts and raisins to the mix. (dont add too many if making balls)
Use a spray of water or 2 more to make balls if needed.
Garnish with chopped raw pistachios.
Consume same day or store in airtight container in refrigerator for a few days.
