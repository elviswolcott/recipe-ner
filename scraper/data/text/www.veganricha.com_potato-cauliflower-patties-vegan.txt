Ingredients:
2  medium potatoes (cooked (or use 1 heaping cup leftover mashed potatoes))

1  flax egg ((1 tbsp flax meal mixed with 2.5 tbsp water))
1/3 cup breadcrumbs (+ 1/4 cup more for coating (optional))

Instructions:
Cook the potatoes if you havent already by boiling or steaming, then mashing. or measure 1 cup leftover mashed potatoes and set aside.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, jalapeno and a pinch of salt. Cook for 4 to 5 mins until golden.
Add cauliflower, carrots. and a pinch of salt and cook for another 3 mins. Take off heat to cool.
In a bowl, add the mashed potatoes. Add the cauliflower mixture, herbs, salt and pepper. Mix well. Add the flax meal and breadcrumbs and mix well. (Chill the mixture for 20-30 mins if planning to pan fry).
Make small 1 to 1.5 inch patties.. I use a cookie cutter then pack the mixture in it, release and shape more. Roll the patties in some more breadcrumbs to coat (this is optional)
Pan fry over medium heat for 3 to 4 mins per side,&nbsp;Or bake at 425 deg F (220 deg C) for 25 mins. Flip the patties half way. Serve with sauces/dips of choice.&nbsp;
