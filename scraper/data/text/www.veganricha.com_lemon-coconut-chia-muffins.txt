Ingredients:
1 cup full fat coconut milk (If using other non dairy milk, add 1 to 2 tbsp oil or melted vegan butter)
zest of a lemon
juice of 2 lemons
2 to 3 tbsp chia seeds
1/2 to 2/3 cup sugar (raw, cane or other)
1/4 tsp or more turmeric
1/2 tsp vanilla extract (optional)
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/4 cup unbleached white flour
2 to 3 tbsp dried coconut flakes
1/2 tsp baking soda
3/4 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt

Instructions:
Mix all the wet ingredients until sugar is well combined. Refrigerate for at least an hour to hydrate the chia seeds. I usually keep it overnight.
Line a muffin pan with muffin liners.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
In a bowl, whisk all the dry ingredients. Add to the wet and mix to combine. The batter should be somewhat flowy but not runny. If too runny, add a few tbsp more flour and mix in. (If the wet mixture was refrigerated overnight, the batter will be thick and muffin like and not flowy).
Add more turmeric if needed. Fold in dried fruit or nuts, candied lemon or blueberries at this point.
Drop the batter into lined muffin pan. Sprinkle coconut and chia seeds on top. Bake at 350 degrees F / 170c for 26 to 28 minutes.
Cool for 5 minutes in the pan then a few minutes on the counter before serving. The muffins can be kept on the counter (covered) for upto 2 days, or refrigerated upto 5.
