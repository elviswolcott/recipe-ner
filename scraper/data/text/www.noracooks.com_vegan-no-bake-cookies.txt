Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
1/3 cup cocoa powder
1/2 cup vegan butter ((8 tablespoons))
1/2 cup almond milk
2/3 cup creamy peanut butter
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
3 cups quick cook oats

Instructions:
Line a counter or two cookie sheets with parchment paper or wax paper.
Add the sugar, cocoa, vegan butter and almond milk to a medium pot over low heat. Stir with a wooden spoon until the butter melts, then increase the heat to medium. Stir constantly and bring to a boil. Simmer for 1 minute exactly, then remove from heat and keep stirring for 30 seconds.
Add the peanut butter and vanilla and stir until combined well. Stir in the oats until they are coated in the mixture.
Drop the mixture by about 2 tablespoons each onto prepared parchment/wax paper. You can leave them rounded at the top, or flatten them slightly if you prefer.
Allow to cool for 20-30 minutes before serving, until they are hardened. Serve and enjoy!
