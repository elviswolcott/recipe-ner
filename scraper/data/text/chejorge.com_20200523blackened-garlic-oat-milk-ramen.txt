Ingredients:
300 grams ramen noodles
1 tablespoon blackened garlic oil
1/2  yellow onion, finely diced
1/2  scallion, chopped
1 teaspoon ginger, minced
1 teaspoon white pepper
1 tablespoon mirin (or rice wine)
1 tablespoon sesame seeds
1 tablespoon miso paste
1/2 tablespoon spicy broad bean paste (doubanjiang)
3/4 cup oat milk (preferably barista oat milk)
1.5 cups water
8 cloves garlic, crushed
1/4 cup vegetable oil
salt, to taste
1  scallion, sliced thinly
1  grilled onion
100 grams bean sprouts, blanched

Instructions:
Prepare the Blackened Garlic Oil. Crush the garlic with your knife.
In a pot, cook the garlic in vegetable oil on medium-high heat until they become black. Once done, turn off the heat and let cool for a bit.
Prepare the vegetables for the broth and toppings. Dice the onion finely.
Cut the scallion in half: slice one half into thin long strips and chop the other half roughly.
Finish making the blackened garlic oil by blending it with a food processor.
Now, it's time to prepare the broth. First, heat up 1 tablespoon of the blackened garlic oil in a medium-sized pot. Sweat the yellow onion, spring onion, white pepper, and ginger powder together for 3 minutes (don't over-caramelize!).
After 3 minutes, add in the sesame seeds, mirin, miso paste, spicy broad bean paste (doubanjiang). Cook this for 3 more minutes.
Finally, add the oat milk and water. Bring the broth up to a boil, and turn down the heat to simmer for 20 minutes.
When 20 minutes is almost up, start cooking the noodles. Cook the noodles according to what the packet specifies. Once the broth is done, do a final tasting and adjust seasoning to taste. Assemble the ramen bowl and don't forget to drizzle that blackened garlic oil all over. Enjoy immediately.
