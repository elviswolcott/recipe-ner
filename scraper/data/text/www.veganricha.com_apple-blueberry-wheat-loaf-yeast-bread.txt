Ingredients:
2 cups whole wheat flour
1.5 cups bread flour
1 teaspoon vital wheat gluten
1/4 cup flax seed meal
3 tablespoons raw sugar
1.5 teaspoons active yeast
2/3 cup water
1/2  medium apple
1/2 cup blueberries
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon powder
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg powder
1 tablespoon vegan butter
1/2 teaspoon salt

Instructions:
Add the yeast and sugar to 1/4 (60ml) cup warm water and mix well. Let stand for 10 minutes or until frothy.
In a blender, puree the apple and blueberries with a little warm water.
Add in the flax meal, spices and blend and keep aside.
In the mixer bowl add the flours, wheat gluten and salt and mix.
Add in the yeast mixture, softened butter, fruit puree and 1/4 cup (60ml) water.
Knead the dough for 8-10 minutes, scraping sides every 2-3 minutes. add more flour or water in little quantities if needed. As with any fruit bread, the fruit gives out a little extra moisture than a normal bread while the dough sits for the rising time. The dough should be soft and non sticky.
Spritz the top of dough with some oil spray. Place dough in a covered container in a warm place for 1.5 hours.
Punch it lightly and shape into a loaf by pulling on all sides, or by rolling it out into a rectangle and rolling the rectangle from one side and tucking the other edge under.
Place loaf in greased bread pan. Spritz the top with water and then spritz a little oil spray and cover with damp towel.
Place it in a warm place or warm oven for about an hour.
Remove towel, spritz top with some water and bake at 375 degrees F for 40 minutes.
Remove bread from pan and let cool for an hour.
I usually refrigerate it for another hour before slicing. The breads are usually quite fluffy and soft and refrigeration makes them a bit firm for nice and clean slices!
