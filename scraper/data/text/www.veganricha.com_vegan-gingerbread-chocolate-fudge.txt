Ingredients:
1/2 cup pumpkin puree or you can use sweet potato puree
1 tablespoon refined coconut oil
1 teaspoon cornstarch (or tapioca or arrowroot starch )
1 tablespoon molasses
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1-2 tablespoons sugar if you like your fudge sweeter
1 teaspoon gingerbread spice mix  (or you can use 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice plus 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger)
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 cup Vegan semi sweet chocolate chips
1-2 tablespoons  chopped candied ginger
1 teaspoon brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon or gingerbread spice

Instructions:
Add the pumpkin puree, coconut oil, molasses, vanilla, cornstarch, sugar, gingerbread spice, salt to a pan and cook over medium heat.
Mix really well and continue to cook until the pumpkin puree thickens about 3-4 minutes.
Then add in the chocolate then take off the heat. The heat from the pumpkin puree will start to melt the chocolate. Keep whisking until the chocolate is melted into the pumpkin mixture and is even and smooth.
Drop this mixture into a parchment-lined loaf pan ( 9 by 5 inch) and even it out with a spatula.
In a bowl, mix in your candied ginger, sugar, and gingerbread spice mixture, and then drop that all over the fudge and press it in. Chill this in the fridge for 1 hour then slice and serve.
Store on the counter for at most an hour, Refrigerate for upto 5 days. Freeze for upto 2 months.
