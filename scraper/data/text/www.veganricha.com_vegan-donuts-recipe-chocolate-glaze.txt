Ingredients:
1/2 cup non dairy milk
1/4 cup maple syrup
2 tbsp sugar
1 tsp active yeast
2 tbsp coconut oil (refined for neutral flavor or use other oil)
1 tsp vanilla extract
a generous pinch of nutmeg and cinnamon
1 cup unbleached all purpose flour
2 tbsp almond flour
1 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
3 tbsp sugar
3 tbsp non dairy milk
2 tbsp refined coconut oil
1/2 cup vegan semi sweet chocolate chips

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F / 180c. Grease a doughnut pan.
Warm non dairy milk and maple and sugar in a saucepan or in a bowl in the microwave. The mixture should be jut warm to touch. Mix well to combine the sugar. Add yeast and mix in. Let sit for 5 mins to activate. Add oil, vanilla, spices and mix in.
Add flours, baking powder, salt and whisk well to make a smooth batter. Let the batter sit for 10 mins. It should increase in volume. Transfer to a ziplock. Snip one of the ends of the bag and pour into greased donut pan. Or use a spoon to fill the greased doughnut pan. I usually like to fill them a bit more than half to make thinner donuts rather than very tall results. Let the batter sit for 5 minutes.
Bake at 350 degrees F / 180c for 11 to 12 mins.
Cool for a minute. Tap to release, cool completely before adding a glaze.
Dip in prepared glaze and let it sit in a cool place for a few minutes to set. Serve.
