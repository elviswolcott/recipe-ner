Ingredients:
3/4 cup dried chickpeas ( soaked for atleast 4 hours)
2  dried red chilies
2 tsp coriander seeds
1/4 tsp black peppercorns (less for less heat)
1/3 cup shredded coconut (, dried or fresh/frozen)
5 cloves garlic
1/2  medium onion (, roughly chopped)
1/8 tsp cinnamon
1/2 cup water (to blend)
1/2 tsp turmeric
3/4 tsp salt (divided)
1 cup water
1/2 to 1 tsp tamarind paste
Lemon and cayenne for garnish.
1 tsp oil (, organic safflower or other neutral oil)
1/2 tsp mustard seeds
1/8 tsp fenugreek seeds
8 to 10  curry leaves

Instructions:
Soak the chickpeas if you havent already, See notes for making with cooked chickpeas. Heat a skillet over medium heat. Toast the coriander seeds, chilies and black pepper until the seeds start changing color. Add coconut and mix in. Roast for half a minute or until coconut starts to get golden.
Transfer to a blender. Add onion, garlic, cinnamon, water and blend until the coconut breaks down. *(Some onion and garlic can turn bitter on blending for long. When in doubt, blend the coconut,water and spices, then add onion and garlic and blend in short pulses till a coarse mixture, or use finely chopped onion and garlic instead of blended).
Add the blended mixture to Instant pot or pressure cooker. Add turmeric and 1/2 tsp salt and mix in.
Drain and wash the chickpeas, add to the pot with 1 cup water and mix in. Cook on Manual (hi) for 35 to 40 minutes. Release the pressure after 10 mins.
Add in the tamarind, lemon, and additional salt if needed. Add cayenne if needed and mix in.
Make the tempering. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. When hot, add mustard seeds, fenugreek seeds and cook until the mustard seeds splutter. Add curry leaves carefully. Take off heat and mix into the chickpeas. Serve hot with rice or flatbread.
