Ingredients:
1 tbsp flax seed meal
4 tbsp water
3/4 cup pumpkin puree (, not pumpkin pie filling)
1/3 cup coconut sugar (or light brown sugar)
3 tbsp maple syrup
3 tbsp oil ((neutral safflower oil or refined coconut))
1 tsp vinegar
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp pumpkin pie spice
3/4 cup almond flour
3/4 cup oat flour
3 tbsp potato starch
2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
1/3 cup oats
1/4 cup oat flour (, substitute option in notes)
3 tbsp coconut sugar
1/2 tsp cinnamon
2 tbsp vegan butter or oil
3 tbsp chopped pecans

Instructions:
Line a muffin pan with liners. Preheat the oven to 375 deg F (190 C).
Mix the flax meal with water and set aside for 2 mins. In a large bowl, combine the flax &quot;egg&quot;, pumpkin puree, sugar, maple, vinegar, oil and vanilla extract. Mix until well combined.
Add the oats to the puree mixture, and mix in.
Add the dry ingredients and mix well to make a thick batter. Add 3-4 tbsp chopped pecans if you like. Spoon the thick mixture into prepared muffin pan. (I use a cookie scoop to scoop the thick mixture into the pan. Then use the scoop or spatula to even the top a bit)
Make the Streusel: Mix flour, sugar, cinnamon in a bowl. Add vegan butter or oil and mix with your hands to make breadcrumbs. Add in the pecans and mix in. Spoon the streusel over the muffins.
Bake for 20 mins. Check if the muffins are done. Remove from the pan after 5 mins. let cool completely covered with a light kitchen towel. Add a simple sugar icing drizzle if you like.
Store: on the counter for the day, refrigerate for upto 5 days. Microwave to warm and serve with vegan butter.
