Ingredients:
2 cups whole wheat flour
1/3 cup water
3/4 cup plant-based margarine
1/2 teaspoon salt
14 oz silken tofu
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon starch
1 teaspoon turmeric
1 1/2 tablespoons herbs de Provence (thyme, oregano, rosemary, and basil)
1 pinch kala namak ((optional but recommended) )
1 tablespoon olive oil
about 7 oz green asparagus
2  green onions, cut into rings
about 10  sun dried tomatoes in oil
6  cherry tomatoes, cut into halves

Instructions:
Make the dough: Combine all ingredients in a bowl and knead into a smooth dough. Form a small ball and let it rest in the fridge for about 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, cut the green onions into rings. In a medium pan, heat some oil and add the green onions. Stir gently for about 2 minutes. Set aside. Cut the asparagus into small pieces and cook in salt water for about 3 minutes.
In a medium bowl, combine the silken tofu, the oil, the starch, the turmeric, the herbs de Provence and – if using – kala namak. Whisk until smooth. Chop the sun-dried tomatoes. Add them together with the green onions and the cooked asparagus (save the asparagus ends for the top) to the tofu-mixture and stir well.
Divide the dough into twelve portions and place twelve baking cups into a muffin tray. Evenly press the dough balls into the bottom and all the way up the sides of the muffin cups. Fill with the tofu-mixture, top with half a cherry tomato and an asparagus end and bake for 30-35 minutes at 350 °F (180°C). Serve together with a green salad or as a snack.
