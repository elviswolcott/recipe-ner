Ingredients:
1 tsp oil
1/2 cup onion
4 cloves of garlic (chopped)
1/2 tsp ground cumin
1/2 tsp ground coriander
1 tsp turmeric
1/3 tsp ground cardamom
1/3 tsp or more cayenne
1/2 cup red lentils (masoor dal, washed and drained)
1.5 cups water
1/2 tsp salt
1 tbsp parsley  (or 1 tsp dried)
1/2 cup packed chopped spinach
1 tsp lemon juice
1 tbsp chia seeds
1 tbsp flax seed meal  (or more chia seeds)
1 tbsp toasted sesame seeds
1/4 cup breadcrumbs (or use flour, glutenfree breadcrumbs or flour for gf)
1/4 cup tahini
1/4 cup water
1 tbsp lemon juice
1/2 tsp dried dill
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp cayenne
Greens or lettuce
Chopped tomatoes &amp; cucumbers

Instructions:
Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion, garlic and a pinch of salt. Cook until translucent. 4 to 5 mins. Stir occasionally.
Add all the spices and drained lentils. mix and cook for a minute.
Add salt and water and cook for 11 minutes partially covered. Uncover, fold in spinach and parlsey and cook for 3 to 4 minutes or until the lentils are cooked and all the liquid is absorbed. The mixture will be soft. Taste and adjust salt and heat.
Add chia seeds, flax seeds sesame or hemp seeds and mix in. Chill the lentil mixture for half an hour.
Preheat the oven to 425 deg F / 220c. Mix in 1/4 cup breadcrumbs in the lentil mixture. If it is too sticky, add some flour. The mixture will be soft but should get easily shaped into soft balls without too much sticking or squishing.
Use a cookie scoop to scoop the lentil mixture onto parchment lined baking sheet. Spray oil on the balls. I usually sprinkle some sesame seeds on the fritters. Bake for 20 minutes.
Blend everything under tahini sauce. Taste and adjust salt and tang (lemon). For a garlicky dressing mix in 1/4 tsp garlic powder.
Assemble the bowl with greens, juicy tomatoes or cucumbers, and as many Lentil fritters as you like. Drizzle dressing generously.
