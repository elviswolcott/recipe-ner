Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
(1) 16-oz block extra-firm tofu
1 small onion, diced
1  large red bell pepper
1  large green bell pepper
4  cloves garlic, minced
1/3 cup peanuts
1/4 cup water
3 tablespoons soy sauce (or tamari for gluten free)
2 tablespoons rice wine or sherry cooking wine
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
2 tablespoons granulated sugar
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 teaspoon  Sriracha hot sauce
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/4 cup green onions, chopped
sesame seeds
more peanuts
4 cups cooked brown or white rice

Instructions:
Press the tofu by wrapping in paper towels or a clean dish towel, and set something heavy on top (like a cast iron pan or a few heavy books). Let it sit for an hour, if possible.
Chop the onion and slice the bell peppers. Set aside.
Make the sauce: In a medium bowl, add all sauce ingredients and whisk well to combine.
Slice the pressed tofu into 3/4 inch cubes.
In a large skillet, heat the oil in the pan over medium-high heat. Add the tofu in a single layer. Let cook for 2-3 minutes on one side, then carefully flip the pieces with a spatula and cook for a few more minutes on each side, until the tofu are golden and crispy on all sides. Remove from the pan and set on a plate while you cook the vegetables.
In the hot pan, add the onion, bell peppers and garlic and cook for 2-3 minutes. Now add the Kung Pao sauce and stir constantly until it thickens. Lower the heat.
Add the peanuts and crispy tofu and stir, then turn off the heat.
Serve over brown or white rice, and garnish with green onions, sesame seeds or more peanuts.
