Ingredients:
1/2  head of cabbage
3/4 cup carrots
1/2  red or green bell pepper
2 tbsp scallions
1 inch ginger (minced)
2 tsp rice vinegar
1 tbsp soy sauce
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp white pepper
1 tbsp nutritional yeast
1 tsp miso (optional)
1/8 tsp Indian black salt (kala namak- optional)
2 tsp crumbled nori sheets  (or 1/2 tsp togarashi - optional)
3/4 cup unbleached white flour
1/4 cup chickpea flour
1/2 tsp baking powder optional
2 to 4 tablespoons water
1 tbsp ketchup
1 tbsp vegan worcestershire sauce  (or whatever sauce as we refer to it in my house ;))
1/2 tsp sugar
a few tsp water

Instructions:
Shred all the veggies. Add vinegar, and everything through nori sheets keep aside for 10 minutes.
Sifft in the flours + baking powder into the bowl and mix in. Add a little water to make a mix that can spread. You might not need much as the veggies leak a lot of water depending on how you shred them.
Heat a pan over medium heat, add oil. Spread the batter to even it out into 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick pancake and cook for 5 to 7 minutes per side.
Serve with the tonkatsu sauce, vegan mayo and pickled ginger if you have some.
Tonkatsu sauce: Mix all the ingredients until well combined and serve.
