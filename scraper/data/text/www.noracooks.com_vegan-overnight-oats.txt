Ingredients:
1/2 cup rolled oats
1/2 cup non-dairy milk, I prefer vanilla soy milk
drizzle pure maple syrup
1-2 tablespoons natural peanut butter
fresh or frozen blueberries
sliced banana
diced apples
chopped dates or raisins
chopped walnuts or almonds
hemp or ground flaxseeds
sprinkle of cinnamon

Instructions:
Combine the oats and non-dairy milk in a small container, preferably with a lid. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
In the morning, you can eat the oats cold, or heat them in the microwave for 1 minute. Top with optional toppings. My favorite combination is with blueberries, chopped walnuts, dates and a drizzle of maple syrup.
That's it! Enjoy!
