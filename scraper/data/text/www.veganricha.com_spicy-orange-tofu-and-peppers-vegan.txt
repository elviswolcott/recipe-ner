Ingredients:
2 to 3 tsp cornstarch (use arrowroot to make corn-free, add more starch for thicker sauce and glaze)
2 Tbsp warm water (1/4 cup for thinner and more sauce)
2 Tbsp soy sauce (low sodium) or liquid aminos
2 Tbsp rice vinegar
2 Tbsp maple syrup (agave or 1 Tbsp raw sugar)
1 tbsp or more Asian Hot Chili paste/Sambal oelek (or 2 tsp of Sriracha (or to taste))
Zest of 1 clementine or small orange
1  Juice of 1 orange (1/3+ cup)
1 Tbsp Oil
7 oz firm Tofu (, cubed, patted down with paper towels to remove excess moisture . I use Nasoya non gmo Organic.)
2-3 cloves garlic (finely chopped/sliced)
1/2  green bell pepper thinly sliced

Instructions:
In a bowl, whisk cornstarch and water. Add soy sauce, rice vinegar, maple, hot chili sauce, orange juice and zest, and reserve.
Heat oil in a very large nonstick pan or wok over medium-high heat. Add tofu to pan and cook, browning on most sides, about 6-8 minutes. Cover the pan if there is too much sputtering. Add garlic and sliced bell pepper or blanched veggies and cook for half a minute. Add the sauce and cook until sauce begins to bubble(2-4 minutes). Then reduce heat, cover and cook for another 2 minutes. Serve with rice or other grains.
