Ingredients:
15-ounce can chickpeas, drained and rinsed (1 1/2 cups)
1/4 cup chopped small red onion (about 1/2 small red onion)
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons tahini or peanut butter
1/3 cup breadcrumbs
1/2 cup chopped cilantro (may also use parsley)

Instructions:
In a large bowl, add the drained and rinsed chickpeas. Use a potato masher or fork to mash them until no whole beans remain.
Add the chopped red onion, garlic, cumin, salt, tahini, breadcrumbs and cilantro to the chickpeas, and stir with a large spoon until well combined.
Form into burger shapes, about 3-4 inches wide and 1/2 inch thick.
In a large pan, heat 1/4 cup of oil over medium heat. Carefully place the patties on the pan, and fry for about 4 minutes, then flip and cook for another 3-4 minutes until golden brown. Alternatively, you could bake the burgers at 350 degrees for 15 minutes, then flip and bake for 15 more minutes.
Remove from the pan and place on a paper towel lined plate.
Serve immediately on buns with toppings of choice. I went with vegan mayo, arugula, tomatoes and red onion slices. Enjoy!
