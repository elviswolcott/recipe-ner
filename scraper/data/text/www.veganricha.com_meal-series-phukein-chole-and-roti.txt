Ingredients:
2  medium organic potatoes chopped
2 cups chopped green onions
4 cloves garlic chopped
1  green chili chopped or red chili flakes to taste
1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds (jeera)
1/2 teaspoon turmeric
1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste
1 teaspoon organic canola oil

Instructions:
In a medium deep pan, add the oil and heat on medium heat for a minute.
Add in the cumin seeds and let them cook for a few seconds.
Add in the garlic and chili and cook for a minute.
Add in the potatoes and cook for 4-5 minutes, covered on low-medium heat.
Add in the green onions, turmeric and a little salt and cook for 10-15 minutes on low heat, stirring occasionally until potatoes are well cooked.
Serve hot topped with chopped cilantro leaves! Serve as part of meal with any lentil curry(Daal), or beans curry, or other soups/stews, Indian bread(Roti) and salad or any indian pickle.(my current favorite is the punjabi raw mango pickle)
Another way to make this, is with Boiled potatoes. Add the boiled potatoes to the pan at Step 4.
Mix well to coat. Add in the green onions as well along with the salt and turmeric and mix well. Cook on low heat for 6-8 minutes since the potatoes are already cooked. The green onions look fresher and retain their shape when cooked this way! Have a fun day!
