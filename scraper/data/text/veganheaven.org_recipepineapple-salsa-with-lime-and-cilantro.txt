Ingredients:
2  tomatoes
1 small red onion, finely chopped
1  bell pepper (orange or yellow)
1  fresh pineapple
juice of one lime
1/2 cup fresh cilantro, finely chopped
1/2 teaspoon salt
black pepper, to taste
red pepper flakes, to taste

Instructions:
Start by making the pineapple bowl. Cut about 1/3 of a fresh pineapple off using a sharp knife.
With a sharp knife, make a cut around the edge of the pineapple to make the pineapple bowl. Be careful not to cut through the bottom of the pineapple.
Cut the pineapple into six pieces. Carefully use a spoon to remove the pineapple pieces. Congrats, you've got a pineapple bowl!
Cut the removed pineapple pieces, the tomatoes, and the bell pepper into small pieces. Finely chop the red onions and the cilantro.
In a large bowl combine all ingredients for the pineapple salsa and stir in the lime juice. Season with salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes. Serve the pineapple salsa in the pineapple bowl.
