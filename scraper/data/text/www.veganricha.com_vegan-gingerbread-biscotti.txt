Ingredients:
1 Tbsp blackstrap molasses
1/4 cup non dairy milk
2 tsp chia seed meal  (or 1 tbsp flax seed meal)
1/4 cup sugar (1 tbsp more for sweeter)
3 tbsp almond butter  (or peanut butter)
1 tsp oil (or use more almond butter)
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 cup wheat or Spelt flour
1.5 to 2 tsp gingerbread spice (or use 1 tsp ginger, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, a generous dash of ground nutmeg, clove and black pepper)
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1 to 2 tbsp dried cranberries
1 to 2 tbsp finely chopped candied ginger
1 to 2 tbsp almond slivers  (or chopped pistachios)

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F / 180c.
In a bowl mix the molasses, milk and chia seed meal. Mix and let sit for 2 minutes. Add the rest of the ingredients and mix until well combined. The nut butter will take a minute to mix in.
In another bowl, whisk all the dry ingredients until well combined.
Add dry to the wet and mix. Add in the cranberries, almonds, ginger. Mix and make a soft dough. If the dough is too sticky, add 1 tsp or more flour. If too dry, sprinkle a few drops of water at a time to knead in.
Shape into a log and press down to make a flat rectangle about 9 by 4 inches.
Bake for 24 to 26 minutes. The edges should be crisp and the center set but should have just a bit of give. Do not let it overbrown. Bake a few minutes longer if baking double recipe (2 logs).
Cool for 15 to 20 minutes. Slice using a serrated knife. Place the biscotti on the side and bake at 300 degrees F / 150c until crisp. 15 to 20 minutes.
Cool completely. Dress with melted vegan chocolate or icing of choice. Store in a container on the counter for a bunch of weeks.
