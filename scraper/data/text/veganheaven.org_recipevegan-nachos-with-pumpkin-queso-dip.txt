Ingredients:
15 oz butternut squash (about 2 cups)
1 tablespoon white miso paste
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
1/4 cup soaked unsalted cashews
1  clove of garlic
1 teaspoon paprika powder
black pepper
salt
red pepper flakes
2 green jalapeños, cut into rings
1/2 small  red onion, chopped
1 small red pointed pepper, cut into rings
1/4 cup black olives, cut into rings
1/2 cup guacamole
1/2  tomato salsa
1  tomato, cut into small pieces
vegan nachos

Instructions:
Soak the cashews in water. Bring a medium pot of water to boil. Cut the butternut squash into small pieces and cook them for about 10 minutes or until they are really soft.
Drain both the butternut squash and the cashews and place them into a blender. Add the rest of the ingredients and blend until smooth.
Place the nachos into a big bowl and add the jalapeños, red onion, red pointed pepper, black olives, guacamole, tomato salsa, and tomatoes. In a small pan, heat the vegan pumpkin cheese sauce until it becomes really thick and creamy.
Pour it onto the nachos until they're nicely covered. Serve immediately.
