Ingredients:
300 grams ramen noodles
1/4 teaspoon chili oil (homemade recipe HERE)
2.5 liters water
6  dried shiitake mushrooms (or leftover mushroom caps, stems)
1 large bag frozen vegetable scraps (broccoli stems, onion skins, carrot peels, cabbage stems, shallot skins, scallion stems, etc.)
4 cloves garlic, smashed
2 inches fresh ginger, roughly chopped
1  yellow onion, roughly sliced
1 tablespoon vegetable oil (or other neutral oil)
1 teaspoon mushroom bouillon powder (optional)
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon fine salt
1/4 teaspoon mirin
1 pinch MSG (optional)

Instructions:
Prepare Vegetable Broth. Start by heating vegetable oil (or other neutral oil) on medium-heat. Add garlic, ginger, and yellow onion & saut√© until lightly caramelized, about 5 minutes. Add all frozen vegetable scraps (and/or fresh scraps) and dried shiitake mushrooms, followed by water. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to simmer for about 45-50 minutes. Note: keep an eye to make sure the broth never boils too rapidly! At the 20 minute mark, you can take out the shiitake mushrooms and reserve them for topping. When the broth is done, use a large sieve to drain it into another pot or large bowl. You can use a ladle to press on the used vegetables and squeeze out any excess liquid. Discard used vegetables afterwards.
Prepare Toppings. While the vegetable broth is cooking, you can prepare any additional toppings you'd like. For my bowl, I simply re-heated some frozen corn, sliced some green onions, and toasted some nori & black sesame seeds.
Assemble the Ramen. Prepare ramen noodles as per packaged directions. Drain them well. In a bowl, make the Shoyu Tare (soy sauce seasoning) by combining soy sauce, fine salt, mirin, and MSG (optional). Add the chili oil, then pour 2-3 large ladles of broth (adjust amount according to taste), followed by cooked ramen noodles & all toppings. Enjoy immediately.
