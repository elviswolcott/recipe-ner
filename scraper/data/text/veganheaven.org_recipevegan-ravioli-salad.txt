Ingredients:
14 oz vegan ravioli
1  zucchini
1  yellow bell pepper
2 cups cherry tomatoes
1 can artichoke hearts
12  sun-dried tomatoes in oil
3/4 cup black olives
4 cups arugula or baby spinach
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
2 tablespoons water
2 teaspoons vegan red pesto
1 teaspoon Italian spice mixture
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste

Instructions:
Prepare the ravioli according to the instructions on the package. Drain and set aside. Add a bit of olive oil so they don&#039;t stick together. 
In the meantime, prepare the remaining ingredients. Chop the zucchini and the bell pepper into small cubes. Heat some olive oil in a pan and cook the zucchini and the bell pepper for about 4 minutes on medium heat. 
Wash the cherry tomatoes and cut them into halves. Drain the artichoke hearts and also cut them into halves. Cut the sun-dried tomatoes into strips. Wash the arugula. 
Make the dressing: Combine all of the ingredients for the dressing in a small bowl and stir well. 
Put all ingredients for the salad in a large bowl and add the dressing. Sprinkle with roughly chopped basil.
