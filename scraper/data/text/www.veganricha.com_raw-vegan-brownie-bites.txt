Ingredients:
3/4 cup raw cashews
3/4 cup walnuts
2 tbsp shredded coconut (, preferably lightly toasted)
1/4 tsp salt
1/3 cup cocoa powder (plus more for rolling, I use dutch processed)
12  soft dates ((any medium to large soft dates. Use 11 to 12 depending on size))
2-3 tsp hemp seeds or coconut or cocoa powder or chia seeds for coating

Instructions:
Add the nuts and coconut to a processor and process until the nuts become an even fine meal.*
Add the cocoa powder and process again to combine well.
Add the dates and salt and process again until the dates have broken down and the mixture is homogeneous. It will take a minute. The dates will break down then the mixture will become doughy. If there are pieces of dates visible, then push the dough down and pulse and process again. Check If the mixture is sticky enough, if not then add a tsp of oil or maple syrup and pulse.
Scoop portions of the dough to roll into balls. Press the balls in bowls of hemp seeds, coconut or chia seed, or cocoa powder to coat.
Store on the counter for upto 3 days. refrigerate for upto 3 weeks or freeze for upto 2 months.
