Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable broth or olive oil, for sauteing
1  small sweet onion, chopped
3  cloves garlic, minced
1  medium russet potato, peeled and cubed
3  medium carrots, peeled and chopped
1/2 cup raw cashews
4 cups vegetable broth
1/2 cup nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1-2 cups water, as needed (see instructions)
4 cups bite sized broccoli florets

Instructions:
In a large soup pot, saute the onion and garlic in the olive oil for 2-3 minutes over medium heat, stirring frequently.
To the pot, add the potato, carrots, cashews, vegetable broth, nutritional yeast, smoked paprika and salt. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for about 15 minutes, until fork tender.
Working in batches if needed, transfer the soup carefully to a blender and blend until very smooth.
Return the mixture back to the pot. If your soup is too thick, add water until a desired consistency is reached (I used 1 cup of water). Add in the bite sized broccoli florets and stir into the soup.&nbsp;
Bring the soup to a boil, then lower the heat to simmer for 10 minutes, until the broccoli is soft and cooked.&nbsp;
Serve, topping with non-dairy cheddar cheese shreds, if desired. Enjoy!
