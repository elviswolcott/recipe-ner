Ingredients:
1  small red onion, finely chopped
3  cloves of garlic, minced
1  orange bell pepper, diced
1  red bell pepper, diced
1 cup uncooked quinoa
1 28 oz can diced tomatoes  (do not drain!)
1 1/2 teaspoons cumin
1 teaspoon smoked paprika powder
1 cup cooked black beans
1/2 cup corn (frozen)
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste
red pepper flakes, to taste
juice of one lime
2  green onions, sliced into rings
1 handfull fresh cilantro, chopped
lettuce
1  avocado, sliced
tortilla chips

Instructions:
Finely chop the onion and the garlic. Dice the bell pepper. Press the "sauté" button on your Instant Pot and wait until the pot is hot. Add some oil and sauté the onion for about 3 minutes. Then add the garlic and cook for another minute. Stir in the uncooked quinoa, the bell pepper, the black beans, the corn, and the spices.&nbsp;
Then stir in the diced tomatoes (do not drain as you need the liquid). You don't need any additional water for this recipe. The diced tomatoes provide enough liquid. Press the "manual" button and choose 13 minutes on "high pressure". Close the instant pot and make sure it's sealing.
When the cooking time is over, do a "quick release". The quinoa should be fluffy. Season with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes.&nbsp;
Stir in the fresh lime juice and sprinkle the quinoa with chopped cilantro and green onions.
Serve in a bowl together with lettuce, tortilla chips, and sliced avocado.
