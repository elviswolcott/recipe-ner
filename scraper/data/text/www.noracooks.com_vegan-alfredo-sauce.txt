Ingredients:
12 ounces fettuccine or pasta of choice, for serving
1 1/2 cups raw cashews
1-2 tablespoons olive oil (or water for oil free)
1/2  medium sweet onion, chopped
6 cloves garlic, minced
2 cups unsweetened almond milk (cashew/soy/coconut also fine)
1/4 cup nutritional yeast
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste

Instructions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil, then add the pasta and cook according to package instructions. Drain, then add it back to the pot and cover until the sauce is done.
Bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Pour the hot water over the cashews and let soak for 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat the olive oil (or water) in a small pan over medium heat. Once hot, add the chopped onion and garlic and saute for 5 minutes, until fragrant and the onion is translucent.
Drain the cashews and discard the soaking water. Add them to a blender along with onions/garlic, unsweetened almond milk, nutritional yeast, lemon juice and salt. Blend until very smooth.
Pour the sauce over the pasta and stir. If the noodles are still hot, you may not need to cook it any more. If you want, heat the pasta with the alfredo sauce on low heat until warm. Serve immediately.
