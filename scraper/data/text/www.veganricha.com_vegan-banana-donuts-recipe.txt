Ingredients:
1/4 cup maple syrup (add 1 to 2 tbsp coconut sugar or other sugar depends on the sweetness of the bananas)
1/2 cup non dairy milk
1 tsp lemon juice
1 1/2  small ripe bananas or about 2/3 cup mashed
3 tbsp coconut oil melted or other oil or use smooth nut butter
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/4 cup shredded coconut
1 1/2 cup flour (I use 3/4 cup spelt/whole wheat + 3/4 cup unbleached all purpose flour or all unbleached all purpose)
1.5 tsp baking powder
1 tsp active yeast (optional)
1 tsp ground spices or spice blend of choice such as cinnamon

Instructions:
Blend all the wet ingredients until smooth and pour into a bowl. Or mash the banana really well, then whisk the rest of the ingredients in.
Add the 1 1/4 cup flour and the rest of the dry ingredients, and mix well to combine. Add more flour a tbsp at a time to make a somewhat stiff batter. You can add some nuts, seeds, chopped dates or mini chocolate chips at this point and mix in.
Let the mixture sit for 5 mins.&nbsp;Grease the donut pan and pour the mixture into the pan (use a spoon or pour into a ziploc/pastry bag and pipe into the pan).  Let sit for another 15 mins to rise.
