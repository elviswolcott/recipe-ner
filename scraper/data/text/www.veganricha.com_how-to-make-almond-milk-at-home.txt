Ingredients:
1/2 cup blanched almonds  (or raw almonds)
1.5 to 2 cups water
a tiny pinch of salt
sweetener to taste

Instructions:
Soak the almonds in enough water overnight. I keep them on the counter for a few hours and then refrigerate.
Drain and wash the almonds. Add boiling water to the bowl and let sit for 5 minutes.
Drain, wash, add the almonds to the blender. Add 1 cup water.
Blend for a few minutes for 2-3 cycles. Add 1/2 to 1 cup more water + salt + sweetener. Blend blend. I usually add 1/2 cup to make a creamy almond milk to use in chai or coffee. Add more water to preferred consistency.
If using blanched almonds, you can strain the almond milk through a strainer or cheesecloth lined sieve or nut milk bag. Use a spoon to press when the strainer is full, remove pulp from the strainer and strain the remaining milk.
If using unpeeled almonds, strain through a nut milk bag or cheesecloth lined sieve. Squeeze to remove as much milk as possible.
Use the pulp to add creaminess to any of the Indian curries, soups or Dals. Or make almond pulp cookies,
Store in the refrigerator for 4 to 5 days. If you don't use up the milk within 4 or 5 days, freeze into ice cubes to use to add to smoothies, curries etc, or make almond milk yogurt from my cookbook.
