Ingredients:
1.5 cups bread flour
1.5 cups whole wheat flour
1 cup melted So Delicious Cherry Amaretto Almond milk icecream
1/4 cup warm water
1.5 teaspoons active yeast
2 Tablespoons raw sugar  (or equivalent sweetener)
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 Tablespoons organic canola oil  (or olive oil)

Instructions:
Add the yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar to warm water. Mix and let it sit until frothy. 10 minutes.
In a stand mixer, add the flours, salt, rest of the sugar and mix well.
Add in the melted icecream, oil and yeast mixture and knead for 6-8 minutes. Scraping sides every 2-3 minutes.
Check the dough when it starts to form and Add a Tablespoon or so more warm water if the dough is hard to touch. Also add in half a cup of chopped cherries if you like.
Knead into a soft dough. The dough should be soft and well formed. It will be sticky because of the icecream, but not because of excess wetness.
Place dough in well greased container. Spray water on top, cover and let sit in a warm place for 1.5 hours or until doubled.
Take dough out on a working surface.
Using a little bread flour, knead for a minute, and then flatten it out into an inch thick rectangle.
Roll it up like a jelly roll. Seal the edges. Place the roll seam side down in a well greased or parchment lined bread pan.
Spray water on top. Sprinkle some oats or seeds.
Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place for 45 minutes or until doubled.
Bake in pre-heated 365 degrees F for 35-40 minutes.
Remove from bread pan and cool on rack completely before slicing.
Serve toasted.
