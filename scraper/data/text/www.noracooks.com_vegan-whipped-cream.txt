Ingredients:
1/2 cup aquafaba (liquid from 1 can of chickpeas)
1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/2-3/4 cup powdered sugar
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

Instructions:
Drain the liquid from a can of chickpeas into a large bowl. Reserve the chickpeas for another use. You should have about 1/2 cup of liquid, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be exact; a little more or a little less is fine.
Add the cream of tartar; this helps with the whipping process. With a hand mixer, start mixing on medium speed. Once it gets a little foamy, increase the speed to high and beat for about 3-4 minutes, until stiff peaks form.
Add the powdered sugar and vanilla and continue to beat about 1 more minute, until fluffy and smooth. That&#x27;s it!
Serve immediately for best results. Store leftover whipped cream in the freezer, it won&#x27;t hold up as well in the refrigerator. It reminds me a lot of cool whip straight from the freezer!
