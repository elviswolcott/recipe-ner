Ingredients:
(2) 15-oz canned black beans, drained and rinsed
4-oz can diced green chiles, drained
3  green onions, chopped
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4-1/2 teaspoon salt, to taste
1 teaspoon Sriracha hot sauce
1 recipe Cashew Sour Cream (*may use store-bought non-dairy sour cream if desired)
24  corn tortillas (6 inch)

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F and line a baking pan with parchment paper.
Make the filling: In a large bowl, add drained black beans, drained green chiles, green onions, the spices, salt, Sriracha and 1/2 cup Cashew Sour Cream. Stir until well combined.&nbsp;
Soften the tortillas: Wrap 5 corn tortillas at a time in a damp paper towel and microwave for about 30 seconds to soften. Don't skip this part because they will be near impossible to roll them up if you do!
Place about 2 tablespoons of the filling in each tortilla and wrap up tightly. Place seam side down on prepared baking pan.&nbsp;
Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy. Remove from oven and serve with additional Cashew Sour Cream and/or salsa for dipping.
