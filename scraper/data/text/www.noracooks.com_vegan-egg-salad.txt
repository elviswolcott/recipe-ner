Ingredients:
1 block firm tofu ((16 oz))
1/4 cup Vegan Mayo  (| homemade or store bought)
1 teaspoon yellow mustard
1 1/2 tablespoons dill pickle juice
2 teaspoons sweet relish
1/8  teaspoon smoked paprika
tiny pinch turmeric (optional, for color)
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste (| use black salt for a more eggy, sulfur flavor)
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1  green onion, white and light green parts, thinly sliced ((2 tablespoons))
loaf of bread, butter lettuce for serving

Instructions:
Press the tofu: Wrap the block of tofu in paper towels or a clean tea towel. Place something heavy on top of it, like a cast iron pan, and let it sit for 20 minutes.
Make the dressing: While the tofu presses, whisk together the vegan mayo (1/4 c), yellow mustard (1 tsp), dill pickle juice (1 1/2 tbs), sweet relish (2 tsp), smoked paprika (1/8 tsp), turmeric (tiny pinch), salt (1/2 tsp) and black pepper (1/4 tsp).
Slice the tofu: Once the tofu is pressed, slice the block into thin strips, then slice thinly the other way. Chop into even smaller pieces. (SEE PHOTOS ABOVE FOR REFERENCE)
Add the tofu to the bowl with the creamy dressing, along with the sliced green onions. Stir well. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes if possible before eating, to let the flavors meld together. Serve on sourdough, or other bread (gluten free if needed) with butter lettuce. Enjoy!
