Ingredients:
1/4 cup + 2 Tbsp almond milk
2 Tbsp flaxmeal (flax seed meal, use golden flax)
1/2 tsp salt
1.5 Tbsp vanilla extract
2 tsp apple cider vinegar
1/2 cup + 2 Tbsp ground raw sugar or other fine sugar
1 Tbsp Oil
3 Tbsp oil
6 Tbsp flour (1/4 cup + 2 Tbsp)
1/2 cup almond milk
3/4 cup unbleached white flour
2 Tbsp cornstarch
3/4 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
Zest of 1 lemon if making a lemon pound loaf

Instructions:
Wet: In a bowl, mix the flaxmeal and almond milk, let sit for a minute. Then add everything else under wet. Mix until well combined.
In another bowl, add everything under dry, whisk and keep ready. If using zest, add to dry ingredients and mix.
In a small pan, heat 3 Tbsp oil on medium heat. Add the flour and cook until aromatic. 2 minutes.
Take the pan off heat and add about a Tbsp of the almond milk. Mix in and add the rest of the almond milk. Mix and put back on low-medium heat. Mix until a thick roux is formed and the it leaves the pan. 1 minute.
Let the roux cool for a minute then mix into the wet mixture. Mix until well combined.
Combine the wet and dry. Drop batter onto well greased and floured mini pans. Even it out using a spatula or oiled hands. The batter will be very thick like a spongy soft dough.
Bake in preheated 350 degrees F / 180ºc oven for 30 minutes. Reduce heat to 325f / 160ºc and bake for another 5 minutes for a browner crust.
Cool completely before slicing. Serve with whipped non dairy cream, strawberries or as is.
