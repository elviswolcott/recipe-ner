Ingredients:
1 cup non-dairy milk such as almond, (soy, coconut, or oat)
2 tablespoons applesauce  (or non-dairy yogurt)
1 teaspoon white or apple cider vinegar
1/4 cup sugar (use 1 tablespoon more if you like your cake sweeter)
1/4 cup  oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
a few drops of almond extract (optional)
1 1/2 cup flour (I used all-purpose, you can also use a mix of all-purpose and whole wheat)
1/4 cup almond flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon  salt
1/2 - 3/4 cup chopped nuts and seeds such as pecans
9  large dates chopped or use 12 small dates
2 tablespoons Chopped pecans
2 teaspoons  sugar

Instructions:
In a bowl, mix all the wet ingredients. Mix until well combined and the sugar is well dissolved.
In another bowl, add the flours, almond flour, nuts, baking powder, baking soda, salt and mix well.
Then add in the dates and mix in.
Transfer the dry to the wet mixture and mix until well combined.
You should get a somewhat thick, muffin-like batter. If it is too thin, you can add in 1-3 tablespoons of more flour. If it is too thick, you can add in a few teaspoons of non-dairy milk and mix in.
Line an 8 x 8-inch brownie pan or a 9 x 5-inch loaf pan with parchment. Transfer the batter to the pan. Even on the batter first with a spatula. Then top the batter with pecans and sugar.
Bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180c) for 30 minutes for the 8x8 inch brownie pan and 40 minutes or longer for a loaf fan.
Check with a toothpick from the middle. It should come out clean. Else bake 5-10 mins longer.
Cool in the pan for 10 minutes and remove from the pan. Let it cool for another 15-20 minutes before slicing.Store on the counter for the day and refrigerate in a closed container for upto 7 days
