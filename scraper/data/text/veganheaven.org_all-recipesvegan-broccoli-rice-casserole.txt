Ingredients:
1 teaspoon vegan margarine
4 cups cooked brown rice ((equals 2 cups uncooked))
3 cups broccoli florets
1  onion, finely chopped
1 cup vegan shredded cheese
fresh parsley, chopped
1 cup raw cashews
1 1/2 cups unsweetened almond or soy milk
1/2 cup nutritional yeast
1 tablespoon onion powder
2  small cloves of garlic
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon corn starch
1 teaspoon white or yellow miso paste
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard

Instructions:
Preheat your oven to 350 F. Wash the broccoli and cut it into florets. Cook the broccoli either on the stovetop or in an Instant Pot (choose &quot;0 minutes&quot; on manual). 
Grease a large baking dish with vegan margarine. 
Heat some oil in a pan and sauté the chopped onion until it&#039;s translucent. This should take about 3 minutes. 
Place all of the ingredients for the sauce into a high speed blender and process until smooth. 
In a large bowl, combine the cooked rice, the cooked broccoli, the sautéed onion, and the sauce. Stir carefully. 
Transfer to the prepared baking dish, add the shredded vegan cheese and bake for 15 minutes. Sprinkle with freshly chopped parsley and serve immediately. Enjoy!
