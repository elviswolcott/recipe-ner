Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups whole wheat pastry flour (or white flour)
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup apple cider
1/4 cup soy milk (or other non-dairy milk)
3 tablespoons unsweetened applesauce
2 tablespoons melted vegan butter or coconut oil
3/4 cup granulated sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
4 tablespoons melted vegan butter or coconut oil

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and spray a donut pan (or two if you have it) with non stick spray.
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and cinnamon.
Pour in the apple cider, soy milk, applesauce and melted vegan butter or coconut oil. Mix well with a large spoon to combine, but do not over mix.
Spoon the batter into the donut pan, or use a piping bag with large tip to pipe it evenly into each donut cavity, filling about 3/4 of the way full.
Bake for 8-10 minutes, until the edges are lightly golden brown and they spring back when lightly pressed.
Cool in the pan for about 2 minutes, then invert onto a cooling rack. Continue with all of the remaining batter.
While they are baking, make the topping: Stir together the sugar and cinnamon in a bowl, then melt the vegan butter or coconut oil in a separate bowl.
Brush each donut with a little vegan butter or coconut oil on all sides, then dip into the sugar-cinnamon mixture to coat well. You could also just brush the top and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar instead of coating the entire donut.
Enjoy! They are best served right away but can be kept in an airtight container for 2 days.
