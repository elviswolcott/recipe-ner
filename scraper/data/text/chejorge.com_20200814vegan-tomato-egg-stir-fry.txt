Ingredients:
3 pieces (50 grams) abura-age, or Japanese fried tofu pouch
3 tablespoons water
1/8 teaspoon turmeric
1/8 teaspoon black salt (kala namak) or regular sea salt
1 large tomato
3 tablespoons ketchup
1/4 cup room temperature water
2 tablespoons sugar
1  scallion, thinly chopped
vegetable oil, for frying
1 tablespoon cornstach
2 tablespoon room temperature water

Instructions:
Prepare the Tomato Sauce. First, remove the stem. Slice the tomato in into quarters, then slice each quarter into 2-3 chunks. In a non-stick pan, heat up a little vegetable oil on medium heat. Add the tomatoes, followed by 1/4 cup of water. Bring water to boil and cook to slightly soften the tomatoes, around 2 minutes. Add in the ketchup, then add the cornstarch slurry (thickening agent) to thicken. Turn down the heat and keep warm aside.
Prepare the Tofu Pouches. Use your hands to tear tofu pouches into large chunks.  In a separate bowl, combine 3 tablespoons of water, turmeric, and black salt (or regular salt). Heat up a lightly greased non-stick pan on medium heat and add the torn tofu pouches. Add turmeric water and cook tofu pouches until all liquid evaporates.
To Finish. Add cooked tofu pouches to tomato sauce and gently combine. Sprinkle with scallions and serve immediately.
