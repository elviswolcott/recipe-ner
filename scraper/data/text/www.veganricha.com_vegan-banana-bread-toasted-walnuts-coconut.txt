In a bowl whisk the dry ingredients flour through salt, including salt really well. Add the nuts and other additions if using and mix in.
In a blender, add all the wet ingredients maple through vanilla extract and blend until smooth. (You can also mash the banana in a bowl until smooth then mix in the rest if the wet ingredients).
