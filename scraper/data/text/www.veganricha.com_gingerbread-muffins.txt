Ingredients:
1 1/4 cup non dairy milk
1/4 cup oil
2 tbsp maple syrup
2 tbsp molasses
1 inch knob of fresh ginger
2/3 cup sugar (use 2 tbsp more for sweeter (preferably a combination of brown sugar and cane sugar))
3/4 tsp ground ginger
1 tsp cinnamon
a very good pinch each of ground cloves, allspice and nutmeg
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 3/4 cup flour
1/4 tsp salt
2 tsp baking powder
1/3 tsp baking soda
3 tbsp or more chopped candied ginger

Instructions:
Line a muffin pan with liners. Preheat the oven to 365 degrees F / 180c.
Blend all the wet ingredients in a blender till the sugar is well combined.
Mix the dry ingredients in a bowl. Add candied ginger and toss to coat. Add the blended wet ingredients and mix to make a batter. Pour into lined muffin pan.
Alternatively, add the dry ingredients except candied ginger to the blender. Blend in pulses of 2 to 3 seconds until you get a smooth batter. Sprinkle the candied ginger with 1 tsp flour, then fold into the batter in the blender. Pour the batter into lined muffin pan.
Sprinkle some granulated sugar or crushed ginger snaps on top of the batter. Bake at 365 degrees F&nbsp; / 180c for 18 to 20 minutes, or until toothpick from the center comes out clean.
Cool in the pan for 10 mins, then on the cooling rack. Store on the counter in a covered container for upto 3 days and refrigerate for longer. These muffins get tastier as they sit as the flavors get stronger. I like them best a day later.
