Ingredients:
1 cup vegan mayonnaise
1-2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning ((depending on how spicy your seasoning is))
1 teaspoon tomato paste
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika powder
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste
sriracha sauce, to taste (adjust the amount of spiciness to your personal liking )

Instructions:
Combine all of the ingredients in a bowl. I used store-bought vegan mayonnaise but you could also easily make your own with soy milk and oil in a blender.
Stir until well combined. Adjust the amount of sriracha sauce to your personal liking.Â Start with just a bit of sriracha sauce and then add more if needed.
