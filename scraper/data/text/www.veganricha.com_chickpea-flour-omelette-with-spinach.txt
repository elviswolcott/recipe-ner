Ingredients:
1 Tablespoon flaxmeal
1 Tablespoon Oat flour (or omit)
1/3 cup chickpea flour (besan)
1/2 cup water
1/4 teaspoon salt
a generous pinch of black salt/kala namak (1/8 teaspoon)
a generous pinch of garlic powder (1/8 teaspoon)
pinch of turmeric
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
a few Tablespoons each of chopped onion (bell peppers, tomato, carrots( 1/3 to 1/2 cup total veggies))
1/2  Jalapeno or serano chili pepper finely chopped (or use black pepper/cayenne to taste)
1/4 cup packed chopped spinach or greens

Instructions:
In a bowl, add flaxmeal and warm 1/4 cup water.
whisk and let sit for 5 minutes. Prep the veggies.
Mix baking powder in the chickpea flour.
Add in the chickpea flour, oat flour, salt, spices and 1/4 cup more water and mix. and whisk for half a minute to combine well and to help the batter get airy.
(Or use garfava(garbanzo and fava bean flour), instead of flax,oat, chickpea. Mix in baking powder in garfava flour and add water. garfava makes a thicker mixture and a fatter fluffier omelette. you might need additional water if the batter is too thick)
Add the veggies, jalapeno, greens and fold in well.
Heat a non stick pan at medium heat and grease a little.
Drop the batter on the hot pan and tap once or twice to spread. (Or use spatula to spread the veggies a bit)
Cover with a lid and cook for 7 minutes.
Take lid off, add a few drops of oil on the edges, cook for another 5-7 minutes(depends on the consistency of the batter).
Flip and cook for 5-6 minutes.
Add more greens and/or non dairy cheese, fold and serve with ketchup, toasts and hash browns.
