Ingredients:
3/4 cup quinoa
2 cups Brussel sprouts
4 cups Hokkaido squash
7 oz tempeh
1/2  onion, finely chopped
1 tablespoon BBQ-sauce
1/3 cup water
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon paprika powder
salt
pepper
1/2 teaspoon liquid smoke
2  carrots
2  cooked beetroots
1/2 cup sprouts ((I used alfalfa, beetroot, and leek sprouts))
1/3 cup pumpkin seeds
1/2 cup cashews (If you want to make it easier for your blender soak them in water for about 15 minutes.)
1/2 cup unsweetend almond or soy milk
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon mustard
salt
black pepper
1 teaspoon white miso paste
1/2 teaspoon paprika powder

Instructions:
Cook the quinoa according to the instructions on the package. Place a large pot of water on the stove, add a pinch of salt, and wait a few minutes for the water to boil. Place the Brussels sprouts in the boiling water and cook them for about 12-15 minutes. Cut the Hokkaido squash into cubes and cook them for 8-10 minutes.
Cut the beetroot into thin slices. Peel the carrots and create julienne strips by using a spiral slicer.
Make the sauce: Place all ingredients into a blender and process until smooth.
Cut the tempeh into small cubes. In a medium pan, heat some olive oil and saut√© the onion for about 2-3 minutes until it's translucent. Then add the tempeh, the BBQ sauce, the water, the soy sauce, the paprika powder, salt, pepper, and if using the liquid smoke. Cook for 5-7 minutes until the marinade is all soaked up and the tempeh becomes lightly brown and crispy.
Place the cooked Hokkaido squash, the Brussels sprouts, the carrots, the beet, and the quinoa in a big bowl. In a small pan, heat the cashew sauce for about 2 minutes. If it becomes to thick, add another splash of milk.
Pour the sauce over the buddha bowl and sprinkle with sprouts and pumpkin seeds.
