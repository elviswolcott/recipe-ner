Ingredients:
2 cups dark chocolate, chopped
1 cup cashews (soaked for 4-6 hours in water)
6  strawberries (for the filling)
2 tablespoons full fat coconut milk ((should be firm))
1 tablespoon agave or maple syrup
1/2 cup strawberries
2 tablespoons coconut flakes

Instructions:
First, melt the chocolate. Either in the microwave or on the stovetop.
Then coat 12 silicone cupcakes liners with the melted chocolate. Use about 1 teaspoon per cup. Gently press the chocolate up the sides of the liners using a spoon. Put the cups in the freezer for about 20 minutes. You could also use paper cupcake liners, but I prefer to use silicon ones.
In the meantime, make the filling. Blend the cashews together with the strawberries, the maple syrup, and the coconut milk into a creamy mixture. Spoon the strawberry cashew mixture into the chilled chocolate cups, add a sliced strawberry on top, and cover with more melted chocolate.
Add another strawberry slice on top, sprinkle some coconut flakes on top, and put them back in the freezer.
You can enjoy them frozen or let them thaw for about 20 minutes before serving. Totally depends on what you like better. I usually prefer to eat them frozen though.
