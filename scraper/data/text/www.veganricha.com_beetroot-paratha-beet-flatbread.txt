Ingredients:
1 cup whole wheat flour  (or whole wheat pastry flour)
1/2 cup unbleached white flour ( or all purpose flour)
2 tsp oil
1 tbsp flax seed meal
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp garam masala or cumin
3/4 cup cooked beets (I used canned beetroot)
1/3 cup aquafaba - chickpea brine (or use non dairy milk)
1.5 cups cooked split peas (chana dal or chickpeas)
1/2 tsp garlic
1/2 tsp cayenne
1/3 tsp salt or to taste
1/2 tsp cumin
1/2 tsp garam masala  (or taco spice or other spice blend)
2 to 3 tbsp finely chopped cilantro

Instructions:
In bowl mix the flours, oil, flax and salt. Blend the beets with aquafaba until smooth and add to the bowl. Mix and knead using your hands till the dough just comes togehter. Use a few tsp more flour if too sticky or water if too dry. Cover and let sit for 10 to 15 mins.
Mash the split peas or chickpeas in a processor or using a potato masher. Add spices of choice and mix in. Divide the filling into 8 to 9 equal portions and press lightly into a ball. Crumbly ball is ok,
Divide the dough into 8 to 9 balls. Roll out each ball using some flour into a 5+ inch somewhat circle.
Place a filling ball in the center of the the rolled out flatbread. Fold the flatbread over the ball and press to seal (like a dumpling). Dust with flour and roll lightly to a 6 to 7 inch size.
Heat a skillet over medium high heat. When the skillet is hot. Place a stuffed flatbread on the skillet. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook the other side for 1-2 minutes. Spray or brush a little oil and continue to cook until both sides have brown spots. Repeat for all the stuffed flatbreads.
Serve these brushed with vegan butter, with vegan raita, or Indian pickle, or ketchup, sriracha, sauces of choice, or with a dip,or as a side with curries, dals, lentil soups.
