Ingredients:
14 oz extra-firm tofu
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 teaspoon paprika powder
3 tablespoons corn starch
3  cloves of garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ginger, minced
2 cups fresh green beans
1  red bell pepper
1 cup broccoli florets
2  carrots
1  zucchini
3  green onions, cut into rings
1/4 cup cashews
1/4 cup vegetable broth
4 tablespoons soy sauce
2 teaspoons sesame oil
juice of 1/2 lime
1 teaspoon brown sugar
2 teaspoons corn starch
red pepper flakes

Instructions:
Cut the red bell pepper and the red onion into thin strips, the zucchini into half moons, and the carrots into slices. Cut off both ends of the green beans and cut them into halves. Finely chop the garlic and the ginger. Cut the broccoli into small florets. 
Cut the tofu into cubes. Add the soy sauce sauce, the sesame oil, and the paprika powder to the tofu cubes.
Stir carefully so all of the tofu cubes are covered in the marinade. 
Add the corn starch to the tofu. It will help to make the tofu super crispy. 
Stir carefully so all of the tofu cubes are covered. Heat some oil in a large pan. 
Cook the tofu for 6-8 minutes until golden and crispy. Stir every few minutes. Place into a bowl and set aside. 
In the same pan heat some sesame oil and cook the onion for 2-3 minutes or until translucent.
Add the garlic and the ginger and cook for another minute. 
Add the vegetables and cook for 10-12 minutes. 
Make the sauce: Place all of the ingredients in a small bowl and stir well.
Add the sauce, the cooked tofu, the cashews, and the green onions to the stir fry and cook for another 2 minutes. Serve over brown rice.
