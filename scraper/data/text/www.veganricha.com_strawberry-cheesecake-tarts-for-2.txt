Ingredients:
1/2 cup oat flour
1/2 cup coconut flakes
1 Tbsp ground raw sugar
a pinch of salt
1.5 to 2 Tbsp maple syrup
1 tsp oil
a few drops of vanilla extract
a pinch of cinnamon or other spices (optional)
1/3 cup firm tofu
1/4 cup cashews (soaked for an hour or more)
1 tsp cornstarch
1 Tbsp raw sugar
5  juicy strawberries
1 tsp oil (optional)
1/2 tsp vinegar (I use apple cider vinegar)
1 tsp lemon juice
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 tsp vanilla extract

Instructions:
Crust: Mix everything under crust in a bowl. Add enough maple so the dough can stay together. Press in the tart pans.
Filling: Blend everything under filling. Taste and try to not eat it all. Adjust the salt, sweet and tang (lemon juice) if needed.
Fill the crust wit the filling. Tap to eliminate air pockets. Place the tart pans on a baking sheet and bake at pre-heated 350 degrees F for 30 minutes, then reduce temperature to 325 degrees F / 160c and bake for another 15 minutes or until the center is not liquid.
Chill for atleast an hour. Drizzle melted chocolate and serve with fresh chopped strawberries
