Ingredients:
2 tablespoons all purpose flour
2 tablespoons cocoa powder
2 tablespoons granulated sugar
1/8  teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1 tablespoon canola oil, melted coconut oil or vegan butter
3 tablespoons non-dairy milk
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
2 tablespoons dairy free chocolate chips

Instructions:
Add the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, salt and baking powder to a mug. Stir or whisk to combine.
Pour in the oil, non-dairy milk and vanilla into the mug with the dry ingredients and stir well with a spoon. Sprinkle the chocolate chips on top.
Cook in the microwave for 40 seconds. It will likely be a little undercooked in the middle at this point, which is my preference, but if you want it cooked more, microwave it another 10-20 seconds.&nbsp;
Serve immediately.&nbsp;
