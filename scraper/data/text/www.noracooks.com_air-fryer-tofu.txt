Ingredients:
14- ounce block extra-firm tofu
2 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
1 teaspoon sesame oil

Instructions:
Quick press the tofu:Â Cut the tofu into cubes. Place them evenly on a flat surface such as a cutting board lined with paper towels or a clean towel. Cover with a layer of paper towels, set a baking sheet on top and then something heavy, like a large book or cast iron skillet. Press like this for 15 minutes. Or use a tofu press.
In a small bowl, stir together the soy sauce, rice vinegar and sesame oil.
Add the pressed tofu cubes to a bowl and drizzle the marinade over them. Toss gently to coat the pieces. Let the tofu marinate for about 15 minutes, longer if desired (up to 8 hours in the refrigerator.)
Place the tofu cubes in the air fryer, in a single layer, so the pieces don&#x27;t touch. Depending on the size of your air fryer, you may need to cook half the tofu at a time. Cook at 400 degrees F for 10-15 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally after 10 minutes. Cook until the tofu is golden and crispy, but not burned.
