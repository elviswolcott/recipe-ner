Ingredients:
1  medium head of cauliflower chopped into florets
2 tsp oil
1 tsp lemon juice
1/2 tsp ground cumin
1/2 tsp ground coriander
1/2 tsp garam masala
1/2 tsp smoked paprika
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp or more salt
1 Recipe my Tikka masala sauce (, use 2/3 of the sauce recipe if using a small head of cauliflower)
1/4 cup non dairy cream (such as cashew ( (blend 1/4 cup cashews with 1/4 cup water until smooth), soy, coconut (optional))

Instructions:
If you havent yet, make &nbsp;my Tikka Masala Sauce. To a large bowl, Add the chopped cauliflower florets, drizzle oil and lemon juice and toss well to coat. In a small bowl mix all the spices and salt. Sprinkle the spices all over the cauliflower and toss to coat. Spread the florets on a parchment lined baking sheet or baking dish. Bake at 400 degrees F (205 C) for 25 mins.
In a saucepan over medium heat or instant pot on saute mode, combine the tikka masala sauce and baked cauliflower. Add 1/4 cup of non dairy cream if needed. Mix well. Bring to a boil. At this point you can also add in a cup or more chickpeas for added protein. Cook for about 3-4 mins. Taste and adjust salt and flavor.&nbsp;
Garnish with fenugreek leaves or cilantro. Sprinkle some smoked paprika or cayenne (really important for a smoky flavor). Take off heat. Then let the mixture sit for another few mins before serving. Serve with Naan, flatbreads or rice.&nbsp;
