Ingredients:
1/2 cup rolled oats
2 cups cooked chickpeas
1  small onion, chopped
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon paprika powder
1 teaspoon salt
black pepper
1/2 teaspoon mustard ((yellow mustard like Dijon or French's mustard) )
3 tablespoons water
1/2 cup panko bread crumbs
1/2 cup cornflakes
1/2 cup almond milk

Instructions:
Start by preparing the crust: Preheat the oven to 350 °F. Crumble the cornflakes with your hands in small pieces. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and place the panko bread crumbs and cornflakes on top. Bake for about 2 minutes until golden-brown. Set aside.
In a small pan, heat some oil and sauté the onion for about 3 minutes. Set aside. Then place the oats into your food processor or blender and process into a fine flour. Add the rest of the ingredients (including the cooked onion) and pulse until you get a crumbly mixture.
Divide the chickpea mixture into 14 equal portions and form each portion into a nugget.  Coat with some almond milk and roll in the baked panko bread crumbs and cornflakes.
Place on a new sheet of parchment paper and bake for 15 minutes.
