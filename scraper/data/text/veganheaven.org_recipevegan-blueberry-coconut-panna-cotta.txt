Ingredients:
1 13, 6 oz can full fat coconut milk
1/2  vanilla bean
1 heaped teaspoon agar powder
1-2 teaspoons agave ((depending on how sweet you want the panna cotta to be))
1 1/2 cup blueberries
4 tablespoons water
1/4 teaspoon agar powder

Instructions:
Scrape out the vanilla bean and put it together with the coconut milk and the agave in a small pot and bring to boil. Stir in the agar and whisk to avoid lumps. Cook for 2 minutes. It's not supposed to thicken up yet, so don't worry.
Fill about half of it in two small glasses and put it in the freezer for about ten minutes, so the single layers don't mix up.
In the meantime, make the blueberry layer. Put the blueberries together with the water in a small pot and cook for about 4 minutes. Put about 1/3  of the blueberry sauce aside (you'll need it later on for the top). Then stir in the agar and cook for another 2 minutes.
Get the panna cotta out of the freezer and gently put the blueberry layer on top of the first panna cotta layer. Then put it back into the freezer for another 2 minutes and add the rest of the panna cotta. I didn't mind that the top layer wasn't as accurate as the bottom layer, but if you do put it in the freezer for a bit longer.
Put into the fridge for about 4 hours to harden.
Top the panna cotta off with the remaining blueberry sauce and serve it with some fresh berries.
