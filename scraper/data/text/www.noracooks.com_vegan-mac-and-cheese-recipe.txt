Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups raw cashews
2 cups water
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1/2 cup nutritional yeast
1/4 teaspoon  turmeric
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 (7-oz) bag shredded vegan cheddar cheese, optional (I used Follow Your Heart)
12 ounces elbow pasta
1 1/2 cups panko breadcrumbs
4 tablespoons vegan butter, melted
1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika

Instructions:
Preheat oven and prep - If planning on baking it with the breadcrumb topping, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and lightly grease a casserole dish (I used a 9x13 inch dish). Skip this step for stovetop mac and cheese.
Soak the cashews - Soften your cashews by covering them in boiling water for 5 minutes. I do this by heating up water in my tea kettle, and then pouring the boiling water over the cashews in a large glass measuring cup. 
Cook pasta - Cook the pasta according to package instructions, but do not overcook. Drain and set aside.
Blend cheese sauce - Drain the soaked cashews and discard the soaking water. Add the cashews, 2 cups fresh water, lemon juice, nutritional yeast, turmeric, garlic powder, salt and bag of shredded cheese (if using) to a high powered blender and blend until very smooth.
