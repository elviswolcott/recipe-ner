Ingredients:
1  yellow onion (thinly sliced)
2 Tbsp vegan butter
2 cloves garlic (minced)
 tsp dried thyme
 tsp salt
 tsp black pepper
1  Tbsp balsamic vinegar  (or 2-3 Tbsp red wine)
 - 1 cup mushrooms (Thinly sliced)
 cup raw cashews (soaked for at least 20 mins in hot water, see notes for Nutfree option)
1 cup broth
2 tsp lemon juice
2 Tbsp nutritional yeast
1 tsp italian seasoning - I use a mix of oregano (thyme, sage and rosemary)
 tsp salt
1 tsp miso
 tsp black pepper
5  lasagna pasta sheets (broken into pieces, or use 4-5 oz any other flat pasta shape )
1-2 cups spinach (firmly packed)
2 cups broth  (or water )
Red pepper flakes (optional for serving)

Instructions:
Heat a skillet over medium heat then add butter with onions and cook for about 8 mins, or until onions start to look translucent
Add in the garlic, thyme, salt and pepper and continue to cook until onions turn a golden color
Add the balsamic vinegar or red wine and mix well, continue to cook until onions begin to caramelize. Remove  of this mixture and save to use as garnish later
Add in the mushrooms and mix well, continue to cook for 1-2 minutes
Meanwhile make your white sauce - blend all ingredients together until smooth. Add the white sauce to the onion skillet and mix
Add in the broken pieces of lasagna sheets and 2 cups of broth(use the value in ingredients if you change serving size) , press down the sheets so they are completely submerged under the broth completely
Cover the skillet and cook for 12-15 minutes or until lasagna sheets are cooked - make sure to check for doneness and make sure to stir once in between so mixture doesn’t burn on the bottom. Reduce the heat if the mixture starts to stick to the bottom.
Once the lasagna sheets are cooked, taste and adjust salt and flavor, mix in the spinach and stir. Remove from heat and cover, let sit for 3 minutes to allow spinach to wilt
Top this with the reserved caramelized onion mixture, some red pepper flakes (optional)  and serve warm. Serve with garlic bread or any side dish of choice
