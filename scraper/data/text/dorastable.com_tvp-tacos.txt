Instructions:
Rinse TVP in cold water. Place TVP in  large pot with 3 cups of water, lime juice, onion, and bay leaf. Simmer for 10 minutes.
While the TVP is simmering place the soy sauce, garlic cloves, onion, smoked paprika, and water in the blender and process until smooth.
Drain, rinse, and squeeze out all of the water possible from the TVP.
Heat a large sauté pan to medium-high heat add 1 tbsp. of oil (optional). Add the mushrooms and cook until golden brown, about 6-8 minutes, stir often. Add the TVP and the chopped walnuts.
Continue to cook for 3 – 4 minutes in the pan. Add the seasoning sauce and stir to combine.
Cook until the meat is golden brown and most of the liquid has evaporated, about 4 more minutes. Adjust seasoning if necessary with salt and pepper.
Heat up tortillas on a griddle or comal coated with a small amount of oil. To assemble the tacos place two tortillas on top of each other place filling in the center and sprinkle with onion and cilantro. Add a splash of lime juice, and your favorite salsa. Repeat this with the rest of the tortillas and filling.
