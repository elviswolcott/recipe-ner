Ingredients:
2 to 3 tbsp soy sauce (use tamari for gluten-free)
2 tbsp water
2 tsp sesame oil
1 Tbsp rice vinegar
1 tsp lime juice
1 tbsp peanut butter  (or almond butter)
1.5 Tbsp maple syrup
1 tsp sugar
1.5 Tbsp minced ginger
4 cloves of garlic minced
1/2 to 1  hot green or red chili pepper (finely chopped)
red pepper flakes to taste
10 oz firm Tofu (cubed ( 3/4 of the 14 oz slab))
6 oz brown rice noodles (I use pad thai noodles)
1 cup  chopped broccoli (heaped)
1 tsp oil
1/2 cup thinly sliced carrots
2 tbsp chopped peanuts or cashews (optional)
1/2  cup Other veggies of choice
salt and pepper flakes to taste

Instructions:
Wrap the Tofu in paper towels then kitchen towel and press with a heavy weight for 5 mins to remove excess water. Then slice into small cubes or rectangles. Mix everything under marinade until the mixture is smooth. It will take a minute for the nut butter to mix in. Add Tofu to the marinade, toss to coat and let it sit for atleast 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, Prep the noodles accordingly to package instruction ( Bring apot of water to a boil, add noodles and cook for 4 minutes for brown rice pad thai noodles). You can blanch the broccoli with the boiling noodles by adding the broccoli in the last 3 minutes of cooking. Or blanch separately for 2 minutes.
In a skillet, add oil and heat over medium heat.
Add the marinating tofu along with the marinade. Cover and cook for 5 minutes.
Uncover, move the tofu around and cook for another minute or 2 until the sauce thickens and forms a light glaze over the tofu. Remove half of the tofu and set aside.
Add the carrots and nuts to the sauce skillet and mix well. Cook for a minute. Add the noodles and broccoli and toss to mix in the sauce. Taste and adjust salt and spice. Add a good dash of salt and mix in. Add red pepper flakes if needed. Cover and cook for a minute. Add the reserved tofu back to the noodles. Do not toss. Take off heat. Let it sit covered for another 1 to 2 minutes before serving.
