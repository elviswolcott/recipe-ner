Ingredients:
1  onion, cut into stripes
1 cup cooked chickpeas
1 cup full fat canned coconut milk
1/2 cup vegetable broth
1 1/2  cup sweet potato, cubed
2  carrots, sliced
2 cups broccoli, cut into small florets
1 cup fresh spinach
7 oz firm tofu
1 tablespoon corn starch
1 teaspoon curry powder
1-2 teaspoons vegan green curry paste

Instructions:
Drain the tofu and gently pat dry it with paper towels. Cut into medium-sized cubes. Toss the tofu cube with cornstarch in a bowl. Heat some oil in a large pan and cook the tofu cubes on hight heat for about 6 minutes until they're crispy. Set aside.
Again, heat some oil in the same pan and saut√© the onion for about 2-3 minutes. Stir in the green curry paste and the curry powder and cook for another minute.&nbsp;Then add the sweet potatoes, the carrots, and the chickpeas and cook for another 2 minutes.
Add the coconut milk and the vegetable broth and cook covered with a lid on medium heat for 10 minutes.
Then add the broccoli and cook for 4 minutes. Stir in the spinach and the cooked tofu cubes and cook for another minute. Season with salt and pepper. If your sauce is too thin, add one teaspoon of corn starch, which you stir into one tablespoon of water. Cook until you reach your desired consistency. Serve over brown rice or basmati rice. Enjoy!
