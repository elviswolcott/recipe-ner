Ingredients:
1 pack Active dry yeast ((7 g))
3 1/3 cups All-purpose flour ((480 g))
1 tsp. Sugar ((4 g))
1 tsp. Salt ((7 g))
1 cup + 1/3 Hot Water ((225 ml))

Instructions:
In a small bowl,  combine yeast with 1/3 cup warm water, and 2 tbsp of flour. Whisk to combine and let sit for 20 min.
In the meantime, combine the flour, sugar, and salt in a mixer bowl and mix on low with the dough hook until combined. Add yeast mixture and continue to mix on low.
Add remaining cup of hot water slowly ( the hottest water that comes out of your faucet), and increase speed to medium-low. Continue mixing for 15 minutes or until the dough comes together and is stretchy, but not overly sticky.
Place dough in a well-oiled bowl and cover with a towel. Let rest in a warm place for 30 min. to an hour or until it doubles in size. (This will depend on how hot it is where you live.)
Place dough on a lightly floured surface and cut into 6 equal pieces.
Take each piece and roll with your hands to form an oval shape. Pinch edges to make the characteristic pointy ends of the bolillo.
Place on a parchment lined sheet tray ( a perforated sheet tray or baguette pan would be even better). Cover with a towel and let rise for 1 hour or until doubled in size.
Preheat oven to 450°F at least 20 minutes before baking. Place a metal cake pan or pie pan on the bottom rack of the oven.
Once the bolillos have doubled in size, and right before placing them in the oven, make a ½ inch deep cut using a razor blade or sharp serrated knife at a 45° angle.
Spray bolillos with warm water and place in the oven. Add 1 ½ cups of water to pie pan in oven.
Bake 20 - 25 min. or until the bolillos are golden brown and they sound hollow when you tap on them.
Remove from oven and let them cool on a wire rack.
