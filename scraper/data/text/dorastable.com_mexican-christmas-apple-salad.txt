Ingredients:
3 cups Diced gala apples ((you can peel or not peel according to preference))
3/4 cup Crushed pineapple, (canned or fresh (drained))
1 cup Green grapes, (cut in half)
 cup Chopped pecans
 cup Almonds, (raw)
 - cup Water
 cup Almond milk, unsweetened
1 tsp. Lemon juice, fresh
1 tsp. Maple syrup

Instructions:
Bring 1 pint of water to a boil in a small sauce pot and pour over the almonds. Let soak overnight.
The following day peel the almonds by pressing an almond between your thumb and forefinger and pressing lightly. The skin should just pop off.
In a blender, place the almonds, almond milk, lemon juice, and maple syrup and blend at high speed until completely smooth and cream like (to get a super smooth sauce you will need a high powered blender).
Place sauce in a small container and refrigerate for 30 min.
In a large bowl combine the apples, pineapple, grapes, and chopped pecans. Pour sauce over it and mix well.
Serve.
