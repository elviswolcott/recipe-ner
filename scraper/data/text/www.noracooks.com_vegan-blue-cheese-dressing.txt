Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups raw cashews
3/4 cup water
2 tablespoons white vinegar
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (from 1 large lemon)
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon dried dill
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 block firm tofu

Instructions:
Soak the raw cashew pieces in hot water for 5-10 minutes. I heat up water in my electric kettle and pour it over the cashews to soak.
Drain the cashews and add to a high powered blender. Now add 3/4 cup fresh water, the white vinegar, lemon juice, onion powder, dill and salt, and blend until very smooth and creamy.
Pour the creamy mixture from the blender into a bowl (or a covered container for the refrigerator). Pat the tofu dry with paper towels, and then crumble into the dressing. Stir gently to mix, and place in the refrigerator to chill for at least 20 minutes before serving, so the flavors can mingle together.
Serve as a dressing for salads, or a dip for vegetables or buffalo cauliflower wings. It will thicken in the refrigerator, so simply thin it with a few tablespoons of water before using if desired. It will stay good for 5-6 days, and it is freezable. Enjoy!
