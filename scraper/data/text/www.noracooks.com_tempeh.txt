Ingredients:
(2) 8-ounce packages tempeh
1/2 cup quality balsamic vinegar
1/4 cup pure maple syrup
1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce
5 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup  olive oil
1 tablespoon cornstarch (or arrowroot)

Instructions:
Prepare the tempeh: Remove tempeh from packages and steam for 10 minutes as whole blocks. slice into small triangles or cubes.
Make the marinade: In a shallow dish (such as a 9x13 inch dish) add the balsamic vinegar, maple syrup, soy sauce, garlic and olive oil. Whisk right in the dish to combine.
Marinate tempeh: Add the sliced tempeh to the shallow dish and toss to coat each piece in the marinade. Cover and let the tempeh marinate for at least an hour and up to 24 hours for more flavor. The longer you let it sit, the more flavorful it will be. Stir and toss the cubes a few times during marinating.
Cook: Heat a few tablespoons of olive oil over medium-high heat in a large non-stick or cast iron skillet. Add the tempeh pieces, leaving the extra marinade in the dish for now. Cook until a little golden brown on each side, flipping often with a spatula.
To finish: Pour the extra marinade from the large dish into a small bowl, and whisk in the cornstarch. Immediately add the sauce to the tempeh in the pan and stir constantly, until the sauce thickens and the tempeh is coated in the sauce.
Serve: Remove from heat and serve with basmati rice, mashed potatoes, potato wedges and perhaps some steamed kale or roasted brussels sprouts.
