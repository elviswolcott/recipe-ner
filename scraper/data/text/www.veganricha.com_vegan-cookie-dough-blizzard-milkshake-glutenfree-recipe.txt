Ingredients:
5  soft dates (pitted or use other sweetener of choice)
1.5 cups almond milk ice cubes (or other non dairy milk)
2 tsp vegan chocolate chips
2 tbsp my cookie dough
1/2 cup almond milk or other non dairy milk
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
cookie dough rolled into small balls for serving

Instructions:
Freeze the almond milk in an ice cube tray for an hour or longer. Soak the dates for atleast 15 mins in hot water.
Add the ice cubes and pitted soaked dates to a blender. Add the rest of the ingredients and blend until smooth and creamy. The chocolate chips will break up into tiny pieces that make the shake look chunky. You can blend further to combine or serve as is with the tiny chocolate chunks.
Pour into a glass. Add cookie dough balls on top and serve!
