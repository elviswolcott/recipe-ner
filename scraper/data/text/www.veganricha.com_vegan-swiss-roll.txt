Ingredients:
3/4 cup non dairy milk
2 Tbsp non dairy yogurt
1 Tbsp flax seed meal  (or chia seed meal)
1/2 tsp apple cider vinegar
1/4 cup oil
3/4 to 1 tsp vanilla extract
1/4 tsp almond extract
1/2 cup vegan powdered sugar ( or other fine sugar)
a generous pinch of turmeric for color (optional)
1 1/4 cup unbleached white flour
2 tbsp cornstarch ( or other starch)
1/4 tsp salt
3/4 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
Filling: fruit preserves (marmalade, jellies, vegan buttercream frosting)

Instructions:
In a bowl, add all the wet ingredients and whisk well until combined.
In another bowl mix in the dry ingredients, or sift directly into the bowl with wet ingredients.
Whisk until the mixture is smooth and silky. 1 to 2 minutes. you want the gluten to develop here so the baked cake doesnt break easily.
Line a baking sheet with parchment. Preheat the oven to 350 deg F / 180c
Pour the batter into the parchment line sheet. Spread the batter evenly using a spatula. The batter will seem like it isn't enough, but we need just a 1/4 inch thickness.
Bake for 13 to 14 minutes. test with a tooth a few inches from the edge.
Slip the parchment with the cake off the baking sheet.
Cover with a towel for a minute or 2 so the cake temperature goes down enough to be easy to handle. Trim the edges to make an even rectangle and remove the hard edges.
Flip the parchment with the cake onto another parchment or thin damp kitchen towel. Remove the parchment on which the cake was baked from the cake. Gently roll the cake with parchment/damp towel into a roll. The first roll may crack. Tighten as you roll. Let it cool completely. Gently unroll, Spread a light filling of choice evenly. Roll up the cake again using the parchment/towel, but not rolling it in this time. Make a tight roll. Place on serving tray. Cover and chill if needed. Slice and serve at room temperature with fruits of choice.
