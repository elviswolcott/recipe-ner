Ingredients:
1  onion, chopped
3  cloves of garlic, minced
2 1/2 cups vegetable broth
1 cup canned coconut milk (full fat)
9 oz gemelli pasta
juice of one small lemon
2 teaspoons lemon zest
17 oz fresh green asparagus
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste
red pepper flakes, to taste (optional)

Instructions:
Cut off the woody ends of the green asparagus and cut it into 2 inch pieces. Pan-fry it. You can either do this in the same pot before cooking the pasta and set them aside if you want to make a real one pot recipe. Or if you don't mind getting another pan dirty, you can also do this while the pasta is cooking. Just add some oil in a non-sticky pot or a pan and cook the asparagus for about 5-8 minutes depending on how thick they are.
In a large pot, heat some oil and saut√© the onion for 3 minutes until it becomes translucent. Then add the garlic and cook for another minute.
Add the uncoooked pasta, the vegetable broth, the coconut milk, and the lemon juice. Cook for 15-18 minutes. Stir a couple of times while cooking.
When the pasta is al dente, stir in the lemon zest and the cooked asparagus. Cook for 2 more minutes and season with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Enjoy!
