Ingredients:
1.5 tbsp flax meal or chia seed meal   (use golden flax or white chia seeds to avoid flecks in the crust)
3 Tbsp water
1 Tbsp maple syrup
2 tsp oil (optional)
1/2 tsp vinegar
1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice (optional)
1 3/4 cup almond flour ( I use Bob's Red Mill)
2 tbsp coconut sugar
1/3 tsp fine sea salt
variations: add spices or zest

Instructions:
Line the pie dish with parchment before flipping to transfer the dough. This will make it easy to remove the pie after baking. In a small bowl, combine flax meal, water, maple, and oil. Let this mixture sit for 2 minutes. Mix in the vinegar, and spices. In a large bowl mix almond flour, coconut sugar, and salt. Add flax mixture. Mix well to make a smooth dough. You will have to press and drag so the flax mixture gets incorporated. This can take up to 1 - 2 minutes. Add a tsp or more water if needed. You can also add a Tbsp or more of powdered sugar if you like the crust sweeter. You can taste the crust before baking and adjust sweet and salt.
Pat the dough down into a flat round disc on a sheet of parchment paper. Flatten it evenly as much as you can by hand. Place another piece of parchment paper on top and roll the crust out to a 10-inch circle. Do so by slightly moving the rolling pin from one end to the other. The dough will crack at the edges, which is fine.
Place the pie or tart dish on the rolled out dough. Carefully flip and press down on the parchment to transfer the dough to the dish, then remove the parchment. Shape the edges. Alternatively, You can also directly pay the dough down on a lightly greased pie or tart pan. Shape the edges and bake.
Bake at pre-heated 330degrees f / 165deg c for 14- 22 minutes. 14 minutes if you are planning to bake the crust again with filling. Bake 20-22 minutes or until the edges are lightly golden for recipes where you won’t bake the crust again. Cool and use.
