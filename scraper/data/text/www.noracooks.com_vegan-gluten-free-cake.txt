Ingredients:
2 cups almond flour
2 cups all purpose gluten free flour mix  ((I used King Arthur brand))
1 3/4 cups granulated sugar
2 tablespoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups almond milk (or soy milk)
2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
1 1/2 tablespoons pure vanilla extract
2 tablespoons softened vegan butter (OR omit and use more almond milk for oil free)
3 cups powdered sugar
2-3 tablespoons almond milk
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
sprinkles, optional for serving

Instructions:
Preheat to 350 degrees F and lightly grease 2 8-inch round pans. I also put a round parchment paper piece in the bottom for easy removal.
In a large bowl, whisk the almond flour, gluten free flour, sugar, baking powder and salt.Â  Then add the almond milk, vinegar and vanilla. Stir well but do not over mix. Pour evenly into the prepared pans.
Bake for 30-35 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool completely before frosting.
Make the icing: Place the softened vegan butter, powdered sugar, almond milk and vanilla in a bowl and mix on low, then high until creamy and smooth. Add more milk or powdered sugar as needed to make a spreadable frosting.
Frost the cake as desired and top with optional sprinkles. Enjoy!
