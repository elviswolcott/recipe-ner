Ingredients:
1 cup non dairy milk  (such as almond, soy, oat or light coconut)
1/3 cup cane  sugar ( or coconut sugar other vegan sugar - 2 tbsp more for sweeter)
1/2 tsp vanilla extract (optional)
1/4 cup smooth peanut butter  (or use almond or cashew butter, - heaping 1/4 cup)
1 tbsp oil optional (add if using natural Pb or omit for Oilfree)
1.5 cups flour (, I use all purpose)
1/4 cup almond flour ((or use 2 tbsp more all purpose and donâ€™t skip the oil) )
1/4 tsp salt
1.5 tsp baking powder
1/8 tsp baking soda
1/3 to 1/2 cup raspberry preserves

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 365F.(185 c ). Line a 9 x 5 inch Loaf pan with parchment.
Warm the non-dairy milk until warm-hot. Add the sugar, peanut butter, and oil and mix well until combined.
In another bowl mix the flours with the salt, baking powder, and baking soda. Combine the wet and dry until you get a nice thick batter. Depending on your nut butter and flours the batter might be muffin-like or thicker. If it is too thick, add in a few tsp non dairy milk and mix.
Warm the raspberry preserves until they are more liquidy.
Add half of the batter to the pan, add half of the preserves in and swirl into the batter using a toothpick. Add the remaining batter and even it out. Add remaining preserves in the same swirling method.
Bake for 50 to 55 minutes. (For muffin check at 25 mins). Check with a toothpick from the center. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes then take it out and let the cake cool completely before slicing. Serve as is or with some peanut butter or preserves. Store covered on the counter for up to three days or refrigerate for up to two weeks.
