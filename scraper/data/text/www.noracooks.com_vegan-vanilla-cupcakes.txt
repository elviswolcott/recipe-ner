Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups unsweetened soy milk ((or use another non-dairy milk))
1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
2 3/4 cups cake flour*
1 1/2  cups granulated sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/2 cup canola oil
1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
1 Recipe Vegan Vanilla Frosting

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners. I usually spray the liners with a little oil as well to prevent sticking.
Combine the soy milk and apple cider vinegar in a measuring cup or bowl, give a little stir and set aside for a few minutes to curdle.
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt until combined.
Now pour in the milk/vinegar mixture, canola oil and vanilla. Stir with the whisk, large spoon or a hand mixer until well combined. There may be a few small lumps, but you don&#039;t want any large lumps in the batter.
Fill the liners 3/4 of the way full and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. Carefully transfer the cupcakes to a cooling rack, then place new liners in the pan (probably about 6 more) and bake the rest of the cupcakes until you have used all the batter.
Cool completely, then pipe on Vegan Vanilla Frosting or Vegan Chocolate Frosting.
