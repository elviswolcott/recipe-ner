Ingredients:
3-4  large sweet potatoes
1 1/2 cups frozen or canned corn
2 cups cherry tomatoes, cut into halves
1 cup bell pepper, cut into medium-sized pieces
1/2 cup cilantro, chopped
1  red onion, finely chopped
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon paprika powder
1 splash maple syrup
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
2 tablespoons water
1-2  cloves of garlic, minced
black pepper, to taste
salt, to taste
fresh cilantro, chopped
red pepper flakes, to taste
fresh lime juice
guacamole

Instructions:
Heat the oven to 350 °F. Use a fork to poke small holes in the sweet potatoes (all the way round). 
Line a baking tray with parchment paper. Use a silicone pastry brush to lightly oil the sweet potatoes with olive oil. 
Bake for 40-60 minutes (depending on the size of the sweet potatoes). Use a tooth pick to check if they are tender. 
Rinse and drain the black beans and the corn. Cut the bell pepper into medium-sized pieces. Finely chop the cilantro. Chop the red onion. 
Cut the cherry tomatoes into halves. Combine all ingredients in a large bowl. 
Make the dressing: Combine all ingredients in a small bowl and stir until combined. 
Pour the dressing over the vegetables and beans and stir well.  
When the sweet potatoes are tender, take them out of the oven and let them cool down a bit for about 5 minutes. Then slice in half lengthwise. Use a fork to mash some of the inside of the sweet potatoes to make space for the filling. 
Equally divide the filling between the sweet potatoes. Add a large tablespoon of guacamole on top and sprinkle it with freshly chopped cilantro and red pepper flakes. Drizzle with fresh lime juice.
