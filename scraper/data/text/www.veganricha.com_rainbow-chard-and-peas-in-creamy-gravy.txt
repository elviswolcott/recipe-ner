Ingredients:
2 teaspoons oil
1/2  medium onion chopped
1/2  Serrano chili pepper chopped or to taste
3-4 cloves of garlic finely chopped
1/2 inch ginger finely chopped
3-4  large chard leaves (chopped (chopped 2.5-3 cups packed) or use other Greens)
1/2 cup peas
1/4 tsp cumin powder or cumin seeds
1/4 tsp cinnamon powder
1/4 tsp cardamom powder
2 tsp Kasoori Methi (dried Fenugreek leaves or 1/4 tsp fenugreek seed powder)
1/4  loaded cup soaked cashews (soak in hot water for 15 minutes)
3/4 cup almond milk  (or non dairy milk)
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp raw sugar  (or other sweetener)
1/4 tsp Kashmiri garam masala (optional (or use regular garam masala + a pinch of ground cloves))

Instructions:
In a pan, add oil and heat on low-medium heat. Add onions, chili, ginger and garlic and cook until onions are golden. Stir occasionally. If using ginger garlic paste, add to pan after onions are golden. Add the spices and mix well. Add chard, mix, cover and cook for 4-5 minutes until wilted. (If using other greens adjust cooking time till wilted). Add peas and fenugreek leaves, mix and cover and cook for 2-3 minutes.
Blend the soaked cashews with non dairy milk until well blended. Add the cashew cream, salt and sugar to the pan. Mix and cook on low heat until the cream just comes to a boil.
Add 1/4 tsp Kashmiri garam masala if you have some and mix. Taste and adjust salt and spice. Add cayenne if needed for heat. Add more water or non dairy milk if you like more gravy or thinner consistency. Serve hot with Naan, rotis, rice or quinoa. Or with Pita/chips as a dip!
