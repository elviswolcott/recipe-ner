Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium onion, diced
5 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon fresh grated ginger
1 medium sweet potato, peeled and diced
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon red chili flakes
6 ounces tomato paste
6 cups vegetable broth
3/4 cup creamy natural peanut butter
15 ounce can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
5 cups kale, stems removed and chopped
1/2-1 teaspoon salt, to taste
brown or white rice
chopped cilantro
chopped peanuts
additional red chili flakes or hot sauce

Instructions:
Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the diced onion and sauté for 3-4 minutes, until translucent. Now add the garlic and ginger, and cook for 1 more minute, until fragrant. Add the diced sweet potato and cook for 2 more minutes, stirring constantly.
Add the cumin, chili flakes, tomato paste, broth, peanut butter and chickpeas to the pot. Stir very well, until the tomato paste and peanut butter have mostly dissolved into the broth. Cover the pot and bring to a boil, then lower heat to a simmer and cook for 10-15 minutes, until the sweet potatoes have softened.
Once the sweet potatoes have softened, use a large wooden spoon to mash some of the sweet potatoes against the side of the pot, which will help thicken the soup.
Add the chopped kale, stir and cover the pot. Simmer for another 5-10 minutes, until the kale is tender. Taste; add more salt if needed or extra chili flakes for more spice.
Serve immediately with a scoop of rice, chopped cilantro, peanuts, hot sauce or more chili flakes, if desired. Enjoy!
