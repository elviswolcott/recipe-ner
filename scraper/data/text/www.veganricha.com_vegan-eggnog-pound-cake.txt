Ingredients:
1/2 cup non dairy yogurt (or use thin cashew cream)
1/2 cup non dairy milk (, such as almond or soy)
2/3 cup sugar ((1/2 cup for less sweet))
2 tbsp organic safflower or other neutral oil
1/3 tsp nutmeg (, add more to preference)
1/8 tsp ground clove
1/8 tsp pumpkin pie spice ( or cinnamon)
1.5 tbsp chickpea flour ((or  use regular flour))
a good pinch of salt
1 tbsp organic safflower or other oil
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1/3 tsp salt
1/4 cup non dairy milk (or vegan eggnog)
1 1/4 cup flour (, I use 3/4 cup all purpose and 1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour. (See Recipe Notes for gluten-free))
1 1/4 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
Icing of choice

Instructions:
In a small saucepan combine all the ingredients yogurt through a pinch of salt over medium heat. Whisk well occasionally to avoid flour lumps and bring to a good boil. Cook for another minute.
The mixture will thicken slightly. Cool for 5 minutes. Add 1 tbsp oil, vanilla, salt and non dairy milk/eggnog and mix in. Preheat the oven to 365 degrees F (185 C). Line a loaf pan with parchment or grease it.
In a another bowl, whisk the flours, baking powder and soda. Combine with the wet. If the mixture is too flowy, add another 1 to 2 tbsp of flour.
Pour into parchment lined loaf pan. Bake for 45 minutes. check with a toothpick from the center.
Let the cake cool for 10 minutes, then remove from pan and cool completely.
Slice with a serrated knife. Add icing if you like. Store on the counter for the day, or refrigerated for upto 5 days.
Use icing of choice (that uses nog or nog spices to enhance the overall flavor). such as powdered sugar + 1-2 tbsp vegan eggnog.&nbsp; I also like a simple coconut cream icing with 1/4 cup coconut cream, 1/4 cup or more powdered sugar, 1/8 tsp salt, 1/8 tsp nutmeg. Whisk until well combined.
