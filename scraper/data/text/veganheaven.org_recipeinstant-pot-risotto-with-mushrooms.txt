Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups arborio rice
3 1/2 cups vegetable broth
1 cup white wine
8 oz cremini mushrooms, sliced
1  onion, chopped
1 cup frozen peas
3  cloves of garlic, minced
1/2 cup nutritional yeast
2 teaspoons white or yellow miso paste
1 tablespoon vegan butter
1 1/2 cups cherry tomatoes
1/2 cup freshly chopped parsley
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste

Instructions:
Set Instant Pot to the high sauté setting. Heat some oil and sauté the chopped onions for about 2 minutes. Then add the sliced cremini mushrooms and the garlic and sauté for another minute.
Add the arborio rice to the mushrooms and the onions and cook for another minute.
Deglaze with white wine and cook for a minute.
Add the vegetable broth and the miso paste. Select manual setting. Adjust pressure to high and set time for 6 minutes by using the + or - button.
When the instant pot risotto is done, do a quick-release of the pressure (check your instant pot's manual if you're unsure how to do that). Don't worry if the risotto is still rather runny when you open the lid. It will still thicken up!
Press the cancel button and turn on the sauté function again by pressing the sauté button. Add the frozen peas and the nutritional yeast. Cook for 2 minutes. Stir continuously. You will see that the instant pot mushroom risotto will thicken up.
Add the cherry tomatoes and cook for another minute.
Season with salt and pepper and add some vegan butter. Serve with freshly chopped parsley and enjoy!
