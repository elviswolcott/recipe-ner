Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all purpose flour*
1/2 cup dutch-processed cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup unsweetened soy milk (or almond/coconut/oat)
1/4 cup neutral flavored oil (such as canola, grapeseed, melted coconut)
2 tablespoons ground flaxseeds
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1 cup lightly packed grated zucchini, drained of excess water (about 1 medium zucchini)
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
3/4 cup vegan chocolate chips

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a standard muffin pan with liners and spray them lightly with oil so the muffins don&#039;t stick to the liners.
In a large bowl, add the flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt. Whisk well to combine.
In another medium sized bowl, whisk together the soy milk, oil, ground flaxseeds and sugar until smooth. Lightly squeeze excess water out of the grated zucchini, then stir it into the wet ingredients.
Add the wet mixture to the bowl with the dry ingredients and stir until just combined, being careful not to over mix.Â  Fold in the chocolate chips, saving some for the tops.
Divide the batter among the muffin cups, filling about 3/4 of the way full. Sprinkle with extra chocolate chips, if desired. Bake for 20-23 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean.
Cool in the pan for about 5 minutes, then carefully transfer to a cooling rack. Enjoy!
Muffins will keep for up to 3 days in an airtight container at room temperature, or up to 5 days in the refrigerator. They also freeze well.
