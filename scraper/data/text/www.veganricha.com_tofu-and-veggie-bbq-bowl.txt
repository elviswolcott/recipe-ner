In a bowl mix the seasoning ingredients + salt + breadcrumbs.
In another bowl add the veggies and tofu, drizzle oil and sprinkle 1-2 tsp water and mix well to coat.
Add the seasoning mix and toss well to coat. Spread the tofu and veggies on a parchment lined sheet or baking dish. Put the peppers and asparagus on a separate sheet so that you can remove them earlier as they roast faster.
Bake at 420 degrees F (215 deg C) for 25 to 30 minutes.Â  Remove the pepper and asparagus after 20 mins and turn the other sheet around.
Assemble the bowl with some cooked quinoa. Add the roasted veggies and tofu, cilantro or parsley, pepper flakes if using. Drizzle bbq sauce all over and serve.
