Ingredients:
2 15-oz canned chickpeas, drained and rinsed (OR 3 cups cooked )
8  cloves garlic, peeled
4 tablespoons raw cashews
3/4 cup fresh parsely
1 tablespoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon salt
3-6 tablespoons all purpose flour
3-4 tablespoons oil for cooking, optional
4-6  pita bread, naan or flatbread
cucumber slices, tomato slices, lettuce
1 recipe Dairy Free Tzatziki Sauce, optional
Hummus, optional

Instructions:
Drain and rinse the chickpeas, and pat them dry with paper towels or a clean tea towel.&nbsp;
Add the garlic and cashews to a food processor and pulse a few times to chop them. Do not blend them up, you just want them chopped. Now, add the chickpeas, parsley, cumin and salt and pulse a few more times, scraping the sides as needed until combined. You want a crumbly dough, not a smooth paste.
Now, add in 3 tablespoons of flour and pulse again until combined. You should have a dough at this point that you can shape into balls without it sticking to your hands. If it's still too sticky, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time.
Scoop out about 2 tablespoons at a time and shape into a ball, then slightly flatten into a disc. Repeat until all the dough is used; you will have about 12 discs.&nbsp;
To pan fry: Heat a large, non-stick skillet to medium heat and add the oil (or omit for oil free). Add the falafel discs and cook for 3-4 minutes. Flip, and cook for 3-4 minutes more. Remove and serve.&nbsp;
To bake: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat and pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees. Add the falafel discs and bake for 15 minutes, then flip and bake 10 minutes more.
Serve in pita or flatbread with fresh tomatoes, sliced cucumbers, lettuce, hummus and vegan tzatziki sauce.&nbsp;
