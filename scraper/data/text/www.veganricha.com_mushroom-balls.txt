Ingredients:
3 cups fresh mushrooms (chopped)
1/2  medium onion (chopped)
1/4 cup vegan butter (very soft or melted)
2  flax eggs
2 teaspoons dried parsley flakes
1 tsp ginger paste
1 tsp garlic paste
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 tsp chilli powder - optional
1/4 cup grated non dairy cheese
1/2 cups seasoned dry bread crumbs

Instructions:
Mix everything in a bowl except the breadcrumbs, until the mixture becomes creamy.
add bread crumbs to make it a bit stiff and make balls. I added some all purpose flour to dry the mixture more so its easier to make balls.
Bake balls on a baking sheet at 350 degrees F / 180Âºc for about 20-25 minutes till the outer crust looks brown.
Serve warm with ranch or green chutney!
