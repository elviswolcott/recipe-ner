Ingredients:
1 cup whole wheat flour  (or pastry flour or Spelt flour)
1/2 cup unbleached white flour  (or all purpose flour)
1 tbsp starch (cornstarch or arrowroot starch)
3/4 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cup mango puree (more if the puree is really thick)
2/3 cup or more raw or vegan sugar or other sweetener (depends on sweetness of the mango puree)
1 tsp vinegar (regular white or apple cider)
2 tbsp oil
1 tsp vanilla  (or 1/2 tsp ground cardamom or both)
1/4 tsp turmeric (optional for color)

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F / 180c. Line a muffin pan with liners.
In a bowl, whisk all the dry ingredients really well.
In a blender add the mango puree, sugar, vinegar and blend well. Add a 1/4 tsp turmeric for color if needed and blend into the puree. (I generally use sweetened mango puree from a can or a combination (some fresh mango and some sweetened puree blended in) and use 1/2 to 2/3 cup sugar. If you use all fresh mango, use a very juicy ripe mango, puree them really well until smooth (with 2 to 4 tbsp water for blending and measure the blended puree). and add a bit more sugar if the mangoes are not very ripe (about 3/4 cup).)
Add oil, vanilla and 1 1/4 cup of the puree and mix in. Add more puree if needed to make a smooth flowy batter. Mix for at least 15 seconds so the batter is smooth.
Spoon the batter into prepared muffin pan to 2/3 full.
Bake for 26 to 28 minutes. Cool completely and frost with frosting of choice.
