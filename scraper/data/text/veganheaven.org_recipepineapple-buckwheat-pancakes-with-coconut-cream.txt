Ingredients:
1 tablespoon ground flax seeds
2 tablespoons water
1 cup buckwheat flour (either grind raw buckwheat groats or use store-bought flour)
1 medium ripe banana, mashed
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 1/4 cups almond milk
1 teaspoon agave
2 tablespoons shredded coconut
1 cup pineapple, peeled and chopped into small pieces
1 can full-fat coconut milk or cream, refrigerated overnight
1/2 teaspoon agave
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1  peach, cut into small pieces
1/2 cup pineapple, peeled and chopped into small pieces
1 teaspoon coconut flakes
1 teaspoon agave

Instructions:
Grind the flax seeds in a food processor. Whisk them toghether with 2 tablespoons of water and set aside to thicken. Meanwhile make the batter: Combine the remaining pancake ingredients in a medium bowl and stir constinuously until smooth. Add the flax seeds and stir in.
Lightly grease a skillet and heat over medium heat. Add a ladleful of the batter. Cook for about 2 minutes or until golden. You know it's time to flip them over when little bubbles appear on the surface. Put them in the oven to keep them warm.
Next, make the coconut cream: Carefully open the can of refrigerated coconut milk or cream. Make sure to keep it level so the cream and liquid keeps separate. Put a mixing bowl in the freezer for about 5 minutes. Then scoop out the cream. Stop scooping when you reach the liquid (you can use it for smoothies). Beat for about a minute using a mixer (on high speed), then add agave and vanilla and continue for another 2 minutes until it becomes creamy.
Heat a small pan and add the peach and pineapple pieces together with the agave. Cook for about 2 minutes.
Serve the pancakes with the coconut cream and the cooked fruits.  Sprinkle with coconut flakes.
