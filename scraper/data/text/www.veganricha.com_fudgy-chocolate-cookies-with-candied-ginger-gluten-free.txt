Ingredients:
1/4 cup maple syrup
1/4 cup smooth drippy almond butter (or other smooth and drippy nut butter)
1/8 tsp salt
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1 tbsp starch (arrowroot or corn starch)
1/4 cup + 1 tbsp cocoa powder (use 1/2 tbsp less for less bitter/dark chocolate flavor)
1/4 cup + 1 tbsp almond flour
2 tbsp Candied Ginger sliced

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F / 180ºc.
Add maple and almond butter to a bowl. Warm in the microwave (a few seconds) or in the oven (a few minutes in an oven proof bowl) and mix until smooth. *
Add the salt, baking soda, vanilla extract and starch and mix in.
Add the cocoa powder and almond flour and mix in. The mixture will be a sticky stiff batter. Chill for 20 to 30 minutes.
Oil or flour your hands and shape into small flat round discs and place on parchment lined baking sheet.(If the mixture is still too sticky, fold in a few tsps of almond flour).
Place a sliced candied ginger in the center and press to stick to and flatten the cookie. Bake at 350 degrees F / 180ºc for 9 to 10 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes on the sheet . Cool completely and store in a container on the counter for upto 2 days. (The cookies can soften a bit depending on the nut butter, bake time etc. Bake a minute longer for crunchier. They are best the day of baking.)
