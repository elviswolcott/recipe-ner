Ingredients:
1/2 tsp ground coriander
1 to 1.5 tsp paprika (I use a combination of sweet and smoky)
1/3 tsp ground cumin
1/8 tsp fenugreek seed powder  (or ground mustard)
1/4 tsp black pepper
1/4 to 1/3 tsp cardamom
a generous pinch of clove powder (ginger powder, all spice, cinnamon and cayenne)
1 recipe Easy Pizza Crust
Or Any of my Glutenfree Crust
15 oz can Chickpeas (washed and drained or about 1.5 cups cooked)
1/4 tsp 1/2 tsp salt depending on if the chickpeas were salted
1/4 tsp onion powder
1/4 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp oil
Sliced tomatoes
Sliced onion
1 recipe Tahini garlic dressing
Or my Tahini dill sauce
cilantro or parsley

Instructions:
Mix the berbere spice mix really well. Preferably also add 1/8 tsp ground ajwain(carom seeds) and ground kalongi (nigella seeds). I know lots of spices :).
Drain the chickpeas and transfer to a bowl. Add to the bowl, all of the berbere spice blend or 1 to 1.5 tbsp pre made blend. You can also use 1 to 1.5 tbsp pre made shawarma blend or garam masala
Add garlic, onion, salt and olive oil to the chickpeas and toss well to coat. set aside. Make the tahini sauce, thin it out to preference.
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F / 220Âºc. Shape the pizza crust. Spread the crust to about 14 inch size to make a thin crust large pizza. Brush with olive oil. Place sliced tomatoes on top. Add the spiced chickpeas in a single layer. (You can also add some greens or pepper as toppings).
Place sliced onions on top. Drizzle some of the tahini garlic sauce. Bake for 18 minutes.
Garnish with cilantro or parsley. Drizzle some more tahini sauce, slice and serve. You can also use vegan ranch, vegan mozzarella (add before baking) or other creamy dressing or just lemon juice to dress.
