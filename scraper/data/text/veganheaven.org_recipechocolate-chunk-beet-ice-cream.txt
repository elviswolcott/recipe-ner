Ingredients:
18 oz cooked beets
1 cup thick coconut milk (full fat)
1/4 cup agave
1 piece ginger (about 0.8 inches long)
3 tablespoons chopped dark chocolate

Instructions:
Put the cooked beets, the coconut milk, the agave, and the ginger in a food processor and blend until smooth.
Ice Cream Machine (recommended): 

Put the beet coconut mixture in your ice cream machine and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stir in the chocolate chunks and place the ice cream in a freezer-safe container and freeze for another 2 hours in your freezer. Thaw for 5-10 minutes and scoop with an ice cream scoop.
No Machine/No Churn:

Put the beet coconut mixture in a freezer-safe container, stir in the chococalte chunks and freeze for about 4 hours, whisking slightly every 20-30 minutes to avoid it getting too icy. Thaw for 5-10 minutes and scoop with an ice cream scoop.
