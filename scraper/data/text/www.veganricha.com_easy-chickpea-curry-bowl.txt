1/2 tsp ground coriander

1/2 tsp turmeric
1/4 to 1/2 tsp cayenne /red chili powder
a generous pinch of ground cinnamon and ground clove (optional)
2  large tomatoes (chopped small, or 3 medium)
1 tsp lime or lemon juice
a handful of chopped cilantro (, 1/4 cup loosely packed)
15 oz can chickpeas (washed and drained, or 1.5 cups cooked chickpeas)
1 cup or more water
3/4 tsp salt (less or more depending on if the chickpeas were salted)

1/2 tsp turmeric
1 tsp ground coriander
1 tsp garam masala

1/4 to 1/2 tsp cayenne
1/2 tsp or more salt

Instructions:
Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add chopped onion, garlic, ginger, chili and pinch of salt and cook until golden ( 5 to 6 minutes.). I usually dump them in a food processor and pulse to make finely chopped mix. Saves all the chopping time.
Add the spices and mix in. Cook the mixture for a 1-2 minutes until the spices get fragrant.
Add tomatoes, lime and splash of water and cook until the tomatoes are saucy. (use more or less tomatoes to preference). Mash the larger pieces. 4 to 5 minutes.
Add the cilantro, chickpeas, water, salt and pepper and mix in. Cover and cook for 15 minutes or more or until the chickpeas pick up some flavor. Taste and adjust salt, heat, tang (lime). Simmer uncovered for a few minutes if needed. Serve with a garnish of chopped onion, cayenne and a good dash of fresh lime or lemon juice.
