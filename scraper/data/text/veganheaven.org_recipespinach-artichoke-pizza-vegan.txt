Ingredients:
1 can white beans
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
1/2 cup cashews
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1  onion, chopped
5 cups fresh spinach
2  cloves of garlic, minced
1 can artichoke hearts, drained
salt
black pepper
red pepper flakes
2  pre-made pizza dough (or: )
pizza dough from scratch
1/2 cup vegan mozzarella cheese

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 °F.
Rinse an drain the canned white beans and put them in a blender together with the cashews, the lemon juice, the water, and the nutritional yeast. If you want to make it a bit easier for your blender, you can soak them in water for 4-6 hours before using them. Put aside.
Heat some oil in a large pan and sauté the onion for about 3 minutes until they become translucent. After 2 minutes, add the garlic. Then add 2 cups of the spinach and cook for 3 more minutes. Stir in the blended white bean and cashew mixture. Season with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes.
Evenly spread on the pizza dough. Cut the artichoke hearts in quarters and put them on the pizza together with the remaining spinach. Sprinkle with the vegan cheese.
Bake the pizza for 8 minutes or check out the instructions on the package (each pre-made pizza dough is different). Enjoy!
