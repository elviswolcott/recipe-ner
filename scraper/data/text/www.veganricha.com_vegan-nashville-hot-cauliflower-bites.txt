Ingredients:
1  medium head of cauliflower (chopped into florets)
1/3 cup non dairy milk (such as almond or soy milk)
1 tsp hot sauce
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 cup flour ((all purpose, or use rice flour for gluten-free))
3 tbsp starch ((I use cornstarch, arrowroot or potato starch works too))
1/2 tsp baking powder
1 tsp oil
1 tbsp oil or melted vegan butter
1/2 tsp cayenne (, use 1/4 tsp for less heat)
1 tsp black pepper (, use 1//2 tsp for less heat)
1 tsp sugar (or maple syrup)
1 tsp sweet paprika (, use more if omitting cayenne)
2 tbsp hot sauce
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp poultry seasoning (( or use sage + onion powder))
1 tbsp vinegar
1 tbsp water

Instructions:
Chop the cauliflower and set aside. Line a baking dish with parchment. Preheat the oven to 425 deg F ( 220 C).
Make the batter by whisking all the ingredients under batter. The batter will start to thicken after half a minute, so work quickly.
Add cauliflower florets and toss well to coat. It will take a minute for the thick batter to coat the florets well. Some uncoated cauliflower edges are ok. Drop on parchment lined baking dish. Spray oil on top. (You can also sprinkle 2-3 tbsp breadcrumbs on the florets in the dish for extra crispyness).
Bake at 425 deg F for 25 mins (35 mins if serving the bites with hot sauce on the side) . In the meantime, make the nashville hot sauce mixture in large bowl. You can double this sauce easily for larger cauliflower.&nbsp;
Remove the dish from the oven and cool for 5 mins.&nbsp;Add the baked cauliflower to the sauce bowl and gently toss to coat.
Drop back into the baking dish and bake for 15 mins or longer at 400 deg F.&nbsp;&nbsp;Serve with cooling dips such as vegan ranch and some pickles.
