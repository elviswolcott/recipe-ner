Ingredients:
3/4 cup natural creamy peanut butter
2  flax eggs  ((2 tablespoons flaxseed meal + 5 tablespoons of water))
1 1/2 cups oat flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup maple syrup
2 tablespoons melted coconut oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup vegan chocolate chips
1/4 cup almond milk

Instructions:
Make the flax egg. Combine two tablespoons of flaxseed meal with five tablespoons of water and let it sit for 5 minutes.
In the meantime, make the oat flour. You can skip this step if you use store-bought oat flour. Otherwise place the oats into a food processor or high speed blender and process until you have a fine flour.
Combine all ingredients in a bowl and stir well.
Preheat the oven to 350 F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and form 12 cookies out of the cookie dough using an ice cream scoop or a tablespoon.
Bake the cookies for 8-10 minutes. Mine took 10 minutes. Then let them cool on the baking sheet for about 10 minutes before you move them to a cooling rack. Don't pick them up to early or they might stick to the parchment paper.
