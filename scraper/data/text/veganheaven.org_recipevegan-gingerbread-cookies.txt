Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
2 teaspoons cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon salt
1  flax egg ((1 tablespoon ground flaxseeds + 3 tablespoons water))
1/3 cup almond butter
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup almond or soy milk

Instructions:
Prepare the flax egg by combining the ground flaxseeds with water in a small bowl. Let it sit for about 5 minutes. 
In a large bowl, combine the dry ingredients. In another bowl combine the wet ingredients and the brown sugar including the flax egg. 
Mix the dry and wet ingredients with a wooden spoon. Stir well. Then knead the dough with your hands. 
Form a ball and wrap it with plastic wrap. Store it in the fridge for about 1 1 /2 hours. 
Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough. Cut out the gingerbread men with a cookie cutter. I used a smaller and a bigger one. 
Preheat the oven to 350 °F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and place the gingerbread men on top. Leave some space in between. 
Bake for 10 minutes. Decorate with royal icing, sprinkles, and candy.
