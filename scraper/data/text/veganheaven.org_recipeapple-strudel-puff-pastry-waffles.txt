Ingredients:
9,5  oz refrigerated puff pastry sheets (If you use frozen ones, allow to defrost before using.)
1  apple
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1-2 teaspoons agave
raisins (optional)
vegan vanilla ice cream
fresh fruits (I used blueberries and plums)

Instructions:
First unroll the pastry. I cut it into three 5x10-inch rectangles, which worked perfectly for my waffle maker. As they're all different, the best thing is maybe to measure the cooking surface of your waffle maker before you get started. Then just roll each piece of pastry to the same width of your waffle maker but double the length of it.
Then cut an apple into thin slices and put them on one half of the pastry rectangle. Sprinkle them with some cinnamon and agave. Fold the other half of each piece of pastry over and seal the edges.
Then heat the waffle maker and lightly grease it with some oil, for example coconut oil. Cook until golden brown. This will probably take about 5 minutes depending on your waffle maker.
Serve them with vegan vanilla ice cream and some fresh fruits.
