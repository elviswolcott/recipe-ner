Ingredients:
1 cup whole wheat flour
2-3 cups bread flour
1  flax egg
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup sugar
2 tablespoons molasses
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon powder
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon vegan butter  (softened)
1/2 cup milk ((non dairy))
3 tablespoons cocoa powder ((organic free trade))
2/3 cup water
1.5 teaspoons active dry yeast

Instructions:
Warm the water to just about warm to touch and add yeast and 1 teaspoons sugar to it. Mix well and keep for 10 minutes or until frothy.
Warm the milk and add cocoa powder to it and mix well and keep aside.
Grease the mixer bowl, add the flours, salt and rest of the sugar and give it a whirl.
Add in the butter, molasses, egg, cinnamon, vanilla, cocoa and yeast mixture and knead for 10-12 minutes( batches of 3-4 minutes with intermittent scraping of the bowl). You can add half a cup of chocolate chips as well before starting the kneading. Add more flour or water if needed.
Knead into a soft dough and place dough in a well greased container. Spritz some water and oil spray on the dough. Cover with damp towel and let rise for an hour.
Punch the dough down and knead for a minute. Shape into a loaf by pulling on alls ides and tucking under. Use some flour to make the dough less sticky if needed.
Place loaf on well greased bread pan and cover with damp towel and let rise for 40 minutes in a warm place.
Remove towel, spritz top with water and bake at 370 degrees F for 35-40minutes.
Remove bread from pan and cool on wire rack. Cool completely before slicing. I usually slice it after keeping it in the refrigerator for an hour so it is a bit firm and the slices come out firm without falling apart!
