Ingredients:
1 cup almonds
1 cup dates
2 cups cashews (soaked overnight or at least for 4-6 hours)
3/4 cup thick coconut milk (full fat)
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
2 tablespoons rice syrup or agave
10  fresh mint leaves
1  green kiwi
1  green kiwi
2  SunGold kiwis
fresh mint
blueberries (optional)
raspberries (optional)

Instructions:
Place the almonds into a food processor and blend until they're nicely crushed. Then add the date and blend again until a sticky mixture forms.
Press int the base of a spring form pan (7 inch) and put it in the freezer.
Then make the cheesecake layer: Drain the cashews and put them together with the coconut milk, the lime juice, and the agave in a food processor and blend until it becomes creamy and smooth.
Pour 3/4 of the cashew mixture evenly on the base layer and put it back in the freezer. Leave the rest in the blender and add one kiwi and about 10 leaves of fresh mint. Blend again until you get a light green and smooth mixture. Evenly pour on the first cheesecake layer and pt it back in the freezer for 2-3 hours.
After the time in the freezer, top the cheesecake with the kiwis and garnish with blueberries, raspberries, and fresh mint leaves. If you want you can also add a few drizzles of agave or rice syrup on top. The cake is best when you allow it to warm up for about 20-30 minutes before serving. Enjoy!
