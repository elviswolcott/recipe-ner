Ingredients:
1/2 cup almond flour
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp cinnamon
2.5 tbsp brown sugar or coconut sugar
2.5-3 tbsp oil (or melted vegan butter)
1 cup pumpkin puree (not pumpkin pie mix)
1/3 cup cashews  (, soaked in hot water for at least 20 minutes.)
1/4 cup maple syrup
2 tsp cornstarch (or tapioca starch)
1/8 tsp salt
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1 tsp pumpkin pie spice

Instructions:
Make the crust: In a bowl, mix the almond flour, flour, salt, cinnamon and sugar unil well combined.
Add the oil and mix in until the mixture resenbles crumbs, and is slightly sticky. It wont be very sticky, but it will stick really well when it bakes.
Transfer this mixture to a parchment lined 9x5 inch loaf pan, and press evenly using a spatula.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, make the pumpkin pie layer.
Filling: Blend all of the ingredients untl the cashews are broken down and already creamy.
You may need to add 1-2 tbsp of non-dairy milk, depending on your blender, and the moisture content in the pumpkin puree for the mixture to blend into a smooth state.
Take the loaf pan out of the oven, transfer the blended pumpkin mixture into the pan and even it out. You can also top this with 2 tsp of sugar, and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon for a cinnamon sugar topping.
Put the loaf pan back in the oven and bake for 35-45 minutes, or until the top layer is set. Check in the center, the pumpkin layer should not be jiggly.
Remove the loaf pan from the oven and let it cool completely before removing from the pan.
Chill the bars for at least an hour and then slice and serve.The bars can be stored in the refrigerator for 5 days
