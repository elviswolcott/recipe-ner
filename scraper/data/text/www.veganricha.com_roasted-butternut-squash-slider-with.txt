Ingredients:
Dinner rolls or slider buns
2 cups cubed roasted butternut squash  (or other squash)
1 tsp extra virgin olive oil
salt (pepper, italian herbs to taste)
1 Tbsp Sriracha or garlic chile sauce
4 Tbsp vegan mayo
2 tsp oil
1 cup sliced onion
1/4 tsp sugar
a generous pinch of salt
1 tsp balsamic vinegar

Instructions:
Prep the buns/rolls. Toast lightly if needed. I used my Spelt Rye Sorghum Kamut Barley Multigrain rolls.
Top the roll with lettuce or baby greens, tomato slices (optional).
Heat up a pan with a teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil and Toss the Roasted butternut cubes in salt, pepper and herbs of choice(I used parsley) for a minute to heat it all up. you can also serve it cold tossed in salt and herbs. Use cubed or sliced.
(If you dont have roasted squash, slice the raw squash and place in a large greased pan on medium heat. Flip the slices after 6-8 minutes, sprinkle salt, pepper, herbs, and cook till tender.)
Top with Balsamic or plain Caramelized onions.
Drench the whole tower in as much or as little of the Sriracha/hot sauce vegenaise/mayo.
Top with other half of the roll.
Eat, spill on the sides.
