Ingredients:
1 cup cashews (soak the cashews for 4-6 hours)
1/2 cup coconut milk
1/2 cup almonds
1/2 cup dates
1 tablespoon popped quinoa
6-8  strawberries
1 teaspoon agave

Instructions:
Soak the cashews for 4-6 hours.
Place the almonds into a food processor and blend until they are nicely crushed. Then add the dates and the popped quinoa and blend again until a sticky mixture forms. Press it into six silicone muffin cups.
Then make the cheesecake layer: Drain the cashews and put them together with the coconut milk in a food processor and blend until it becomes creamy and smooth. Then add the strawberries and blend for another minute.
Pour it evenly on the base layer and freeze for about 4-6 hours.
Allow the mini cheesecakes to warm up for 30-60 minutes before you serve them.
