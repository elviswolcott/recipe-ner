Ingredients:
15 ounces canned pumpkin
1/4 cup melted coconut oil
2 cups soy milk
1/4 cup granulated sugar
2 1/4 cups all purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Instructions:
Preheat your waffle iron.
In a large bowl, whisk together the canned pumpkin, oil, soy milk and sugar until smooth.
Add the flour to the bowl with the wet ingredients, then sprinkle on top of the flour the baking powder, baking soda, salt and spices. Mix with a large spoon until just combined. The batter should be fairly thick, not too runny. If it&#x27;s runny, add a little more flour. If it gets too thick, add a little water.
Spray waffle iron well with oil (unless your waffle iron is non-stick). Pour the recommended amount of batter onto hot waffle iron, and cook until the waffle is golden brown on both sides.
Serve immediately, or keep in a warm oven (200 degrees F) until ready to serve. Top with vegan whipped cream, vegan butter, maple syrup and anything else you desire!
