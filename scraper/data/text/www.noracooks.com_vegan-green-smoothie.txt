Ingredients:
1  banana, frozen preferred (or use 1/2 cup more frozen fruit)
1 cup frozen mango  (or blueberries, pineapple, berries)
2-3 cups baby spinach, kale or mixed super greens
2 tablespoons hemp seeds
1/4 cup orange juice
1 cup almond milk
optional: 1 date, pitted, for additional sweetness

Instructions:
Add all ingredients to a high powered blender and blend until creamy and smooth. If it&#x27;s too thin, add more frozen fruit or a handful of ice. If it&#x27;s too thick, add water or more almond milk until a desirable consistency is reached.
Serve immediately. Best when fresh, but you could store it in the refrigerator overnight in a covered jar if needed.
