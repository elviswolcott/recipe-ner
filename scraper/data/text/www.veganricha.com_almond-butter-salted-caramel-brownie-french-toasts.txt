Ingredients:
1 cup non dairy milk
2 tbsp flour (white or wheat or glutenfree(rice or chickpea))
3 tbsp or more cocoa powder
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
2 tbsp maple syrup
2 tbsp sugar
1 tsp oil
9 to 10  soft medjool dates (soaked in hot water for half an hour)
3/4 cup non dairy milk
1/4 tsp salt or to taste
Creamy almond butter or peanut butter
6 to 8  Bread slices, home baked ( or artisan or french bread)
vegan chocolate ganache (or melted vegan chocolate )

Instructions:
Blend everything under brownie batter. Pour into a shallow bowl.
Blend everything under salted date caramel until smooth, Add more non dairy milk if needed. Taste and adjust salt and sweet. Add a touch of sugar or maple if needed.
Spread almond/peanut butter on a slice of bread. Spread date caramel generously on the other slice. Combine the 2 slices into a sandwich. (You can also use fruit preserves instead of salted caramel for a PBJ filling)
Place the sandwich into the brownie batter, flip after 10 seconds and soak the other side.
Cook on a heated and greased pan for 2 to 4 minutes each side. Repeat for the rest of the french toasts. Store the french toasts in the oven at a minimum setting to keep warm until ready to serve.
Drizzle more salted caramel and melted chocolate or chocolate ganache on the french toast. Dust with sugar (optional). Serve with favorite fruits.
