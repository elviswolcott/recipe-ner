Ingredients:
1/2 cup dry lentils
1 1/2 cups water
1  sweet potato or yam (cubed (1 - 1 1/2 cups))
1 Tbsp olive oil
1/2 medium red onion (chopped (3/4 cup))
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp chipotle chili powder (or 1 chipotle chili in adobo sauce, chopped)
1/4 - 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
1/2 tsp cumin powder (or cumin seeds)
1 tsp coriander powder
1/2 tsp dried oregano
1/2 tsp dried basil
3/4 tsp salt (or more, to taste)
a generous dash of black pepper
1 Tbsp tomato paste (or 1/2 large ripe tomato, finely chopped)
1 tsp sriracha sauce
1-2 tsp lime juice
a dash of liquid smoke (optional, for extra smokiness)
hard or soft tacos (I used gluten-free blue corn tortillas)
lettuce or cabbage (finely chopped)
salsa of choice (I used pico de gallo)
avocado, jalapenos, cilantro, lime juice

Instructions:
Soak the lentils for half an hour. Chop up the potatoes, get the ingredients ready. Drain the lentils, wash, and keep ready.
In a deep pan, add oil and heat on medium heat. Add onion and cook until golden (5 to 6 mins).
Add all the spices, herbs, salt, pepper, tomato paste/tomato, and mix well. Cook for a minute (2-3 minutes if using a tomato).
Add the washed lentils and water. Mix, cover, and cook on low-medium heat for 15 minutes.
Add the cubed sweet potato, Sriracha, mix, and cook covered for another 15-25 minutes until lentils and sweet potato are tender and all liquid is absorbed.
Add lime juice, taste, and adjust for salt and spice. Add a dash of liquid smoke for extra smokiness.
Warm the taco shells, then load them with the warm lentil mixture, lettuce/cabbage, fresh salsa, avocado, jalapeno, cilantro, and lime juice. Serve immediately.
