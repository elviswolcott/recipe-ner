Ingredients:
7 to 8  thick slices of pumpkin cornbread or 6 to 7 thick slices of pumpkin cinnamon bread or other whole grain stale bread (see notes for links)
1/2 cup pumpkin puree
3/4 cup non dairy milk ( (almond milk, soy milk or coconut milk))
1 tbsp starch ((cornstarch or arrowroot starch))
1 tbsp flour (, use rice flour to make gluten-free)
2 tsp flax meal (optional)
1/2 tsp  vanilla extract
1 tbsp maple syrup or sugar
1 tsp pumpkin pie spice
1/8 tsp salt
2  small apples, thinly sliced
1/2 cup water
3 tbsp coconut sugar
1/2 tsp  pumpkin pie spice (or cinnamon)

Instructions:
Mix all the ingredients under batter and let it sit for a few minutes while you heat up the skillet over medium heat.
Dip the slices in the batter for a few seconds, then place on the hot skillet (sprayed with oil for cast iron or no oil if using a good non stick). Cook for 4 to 5 minutes then flip and cook for another 3 to 4 or until golden brown on both sides. Serve with maple and vegan butter or some caramelized apples
Caramelized apples: Heat a skillet over medium heat. Add apples, sugar, spices, water and a pinch of salt. Cook for 10 to 15 minutes or until the syrup thickens. Stir occasionally to avoid burning.
