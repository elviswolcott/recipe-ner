Ingredients:
one  package store-bought vegan gnocchi  ((17.6 oz))
3 cups baby spinach
1 jar artichoke hearts in oil
1/2 cup cashews (unsalted and not roasted)
2  large cloves of garlic
3 tablespoons nutritional yeast
2 teaspoons yellow or white miso paste
1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon tapioca starch (or corn starch if you can&#x27;t find tapioca starch)
1 cup unsweetened almond or soy milk
1/2 teaspoon salt
black pepper, to taste

Instructions:
Make the sauce: Place all ingredients in a high speed blender and process until smooth. This should take about 30 seconds to a minute. I didn&#x27;t soak the cashews, but if you want to make things easier for your blender, you could soak them in hot water for 30 minutes or even overnight. 
Prepare the gnocchi according to the instructions on the package. Drain and set aside. 
Pour the creamy cashew sauce into a pan and heat on medium heat for about 2 minutes. It will thicken up considerably. 
Add the cooked gnocchi, the spinach, and the artichoke hearts and cook for another 2 minutes until the spinach has wilted.  
Sprinkle with freshly chopped parsley and red pepper flakes and serve immediately.
