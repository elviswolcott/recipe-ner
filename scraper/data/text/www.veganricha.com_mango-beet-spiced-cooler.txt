Ingredients:
1  medium mango
1/2  medium beet peeled and chopped
8-10  mint leaves (or dry mint or basil to taste)
2-3 cups of water
2 tablespoons raw sugar or jaggery
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon rock salt (kala namak or 1 Tablespoon lemon juice)
1/4 teaspoon cumin powder

Instructions:
In a pressure cooker or a deep pan, add beet, peeled chopped mango, mint leaves, salt, sugar, rock salt or lemon juice, cumin powder, and water enough to cover the fruit.
Pressure cook for 1 whistle, or boil for 15-20 minutes until mango is soft and cooked.
Blend the mixture when cool and adjust salt, sugar and rock salt(rock salt adds a nice sour taste).
Add more or less water according to preference. For super hot days, add more chilled water to get a watery version... quick rehydration! Keep it thick and smoothie like for a filling breakfast!
Serve chilled topped with fresh mint leaves! Or add a splash of your favorite liquor !
