Ingredients:
1 cup basmati rice
1 1/2 cups water
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 teaspoon salt

Instructions:
Place the rice to a medium sized pot and add enough water to cover it by a few inches. Use your hands to swish the rice around, then carefully pour off the cloudy water. Repeat 3-4 times until the water is nearly clear. Drain off the rest of the water, or use a fine mesh strainer to completely drain it, then add the rice back to the pot.
Now add 1 1/2 cups fresh water to the rice along with the oil and salt. Bring to a boil, uncovered at first, then once boiling cover the pot with a tight fitting lid and turn the heat down so the rice is simmering. Cook for 15 minutes, until the water appears absorbed. Remove from heat and let it steam for another 5-10 minutes.
Fluffy the rice with a fork and serve.
