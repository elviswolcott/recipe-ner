Ingredients:
1 cup Chopped red, yellow and green bell pepper mix
½ cup Chopped spicy pepper of choice (jalapeño, cherry bomb, etc.)
½ cup Chopped red onion
1/2  cup Low-sodium veggie broth (or drizzle of oil, for sautéing)
1 tsp. Sea salt
1 tsp. Garlic Powder
2 tbsp. Fresh lime juice
1 ½ cups Cooked brown rice
1 cup Cooked or canned black beans, drained and rinsed
¼ cup Chopped fresh cilantro
1 tbsp Fresh lime juice
¾ tsp sea salt
½ tsp chipotle powder
4 to 5 to  tortillas
Avocado
Shredded cabbage
Smoky Tangy Cream ((page 135) or World’s Best Roasted Salsa (page 132))

Instructions:
Sauté the peppers and onion in a pan over medium heat with veggie broth, salt, garlic powder and lime juice until cooked and fragrant, about 10 to 12 minutes. You may need to add more broth if it gets too dry. The mixture is ready when the veggies are soft and almost sticky looking.
To make the rice and beans, put the cooked rice, beans, cilantro, lime juice, salt and chipotle powder in a bowl and mix well.
Once everything is ready, build the burritos by filling the tortillas with the rice and beans, sautéed veggies, avocado and shredded cabbage.
Drizzle the sauce or salsa over the filling ingredients.
To fold the burrito, fold the sides over toward the center, then roll upward to create a burrito. (See page 15 for step-by-step photos.) You can grill the seam for 7 to 8 minutes until it seals and closes the burrito. You can also grill the other side to make it crisp.
Kids: This can be served as a bowl if folding a burrito is too hard! Do not add spicy peppers or chipotle powder. Substitute spicy peppers with bell peppers.
