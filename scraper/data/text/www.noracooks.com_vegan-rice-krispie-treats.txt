Ingredients:
3/4 cup vegan butter
two 10-ounce bags vegan marshmallows*
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
8 cups rice krispie cereal*

Instructions:
Line a 9 x 13 inch baking pan with parchment paper and lightly spray with oil. Set aside.
In a large pot, melt the vegan butter. Now add the vegan marshmallows and stir, until the marshmallows are melted. They won&#x27;t melt as well as regular marshmallows, but they should still melt and turn into sort of a big blob.
Remove the pan from heat and stir in the vanilla. Now fold in the cereal using a large spoon or spatula. There will be chunks of marshmallows and that&#x27;s okay, just try to coat all the cereal.
Transfer to the prepared pan and press down evenly either with your hands or a spatula. You can lightly grease the spatula if it sticks.
Allow the treats to cool for 1 hour. Remove from the pan, using the parchment paper, then cut into squares and serve. Enjoy!
