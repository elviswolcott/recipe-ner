Ingredients:
2 cups bread flour
1 cup all purpose flour (or more for kneading)
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons sugar
1 teaspoons oil (for greasing containers)
1 cup water
1.5 teaspoons active yeast

Instructions:
Warm the water to about 110 degrees F and mix in the yeast and sugar in it
Let the mixture sit for 10 minutes till it is frothy.
In a large pan, add the all purpose flour and salt and mix well.
Add in the yeast mixture  and olive oil and blend well.
Add in the bread flour 1 cup at a time to knead into a soft dough.
Place dough in a well oiled container, covered( with a towel or plastic wrap) , in a warm oven for about an hour. or until doubled.
Take the dough and knead it well on a well floured surface for about 5 minutes.
Place dough again in a well oiled container, covered and in a warm oven, to rise for about half an hour.
Knead again for 5 minutes and let rise(in the bread pan) for another half hour. Multiple kneadings releases and aligns the gluten and gives a nice stranded bread.

Brush melted butter on top.
Cool on rack before slicing!
