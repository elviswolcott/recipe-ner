Ingredients:
7 oz cocoa butter (Now foods or Fair trade certified Artisana or Navitas Naturals I used Now foods))
3  Theo Classic Organic
1/3 cup coconut milk (full fat, canned)
1/3 cup ground raw sugar or other fine sugar
1 Tbsp vanilla extract
1/2 cup finely ground oat flour (use certified gf oats, or use more almond flour to omit oats)
1/2 cup finely ground almond flour (use oat flour to omit nuts)
1/3 cup ground raw sugar
3 Tbsp of base cocoa butter chocolate mixture
2 to 3 tsp maple syrup
All of the base (minus 3 tbsp) of Cocoa butter +chocolate Mixture
1/3 cup coconut milk
1/3 cup firm or silken tofu (well drained)
1/4 cup ground raw sugar
1/2 cup coconut milk
1/3 cup ground raw sugar
1/2 cup firm or silken tofu (well drained)
1.5 tsp vanilla
3 Tbsp melted cocoa butter
3 tbsp of the reserved cocoa butter + chocolate mixture

Instructions:
Base cocoa butter + chocolate mixture: In a pan, add the cocoa butter and heat at medium heat until fully melted. Depending on the cocoa butter, it can take 10 or more mins. Remove from heat when melted.
Remove 3 Tbsp of the melted cocoa butter into a bowl and set aside.
To the melted hot cocoa butter in the pan, add the dark chocolate let sit for half a minute. Whisk the dark chocolate to melt evenly.
Meanwhile, mix the 1/3 cup sugar into 1/3 cup coconut milk until well combined. Add this and vanilla to the pan and mix well until smooth and shiny. This is the base cocoa butter + chocolate mixture.
Make the crust: Mix the oat and almond flours with the sugar. Add 3 Tbsp of the base cocoa butter + chocolate mixture, and maple syrup to make a soft dough. Press the dough into Parchment lined cake pan. (or use a baked chocolate cake bottom like this one or this one)
Make the dark chocolate mousse layer: Add the rest of the base cocoa butter = chocolate mixture to a blender, add 1/3 cup coconut milk, 1/3 cup tofu or very thick cashew cream, sugar and blend to a smooth consistency. Pour 2/3 of this blended mixture into the cake pan. Reserve the 1/3 of the mixture in the blender. Refrigerate the cake pan with the dark chocolate mousse for 15 mins.
Make the lighter chocolate mousse layer: Add 1/2 cup coconut milk, 1/3 cup sugar, 1/2 cup tofu, 1.5 tsp vanilla, the 3 Tbsp reserved cocoa butter from step 2, to the blender (which has the reserve mix from step 6), and blend to smooth consistency. Pour into the pan over the dark chocolate layer. Even it out with a spatula if needed.
Chill the cake for a few hours, slice and serve with a dollop of vegan vanilla ice cream.
