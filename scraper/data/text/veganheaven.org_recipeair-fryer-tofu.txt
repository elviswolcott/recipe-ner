Ingredients:
21  oz extra-firm tofu
2 tablespoons sesame oil
4 tablespoons soy sauce
2  cloves of garlic
1 inch piece fresh ginger
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
1 teaspoon paprika powder
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika powder
1 teaspoon maple syrup
1 teaspoon onion powder
red pepper flakes

Instructions:
Cut the tofu into cubes. 
Make the tofu marinade. In a large bowl, add all of the ingredients for the marinade and stir well. 
Add the tofu cubes and stir well. 
If you&#039;ve got enough time, let the tofu marinade for about 10-20 minutes for a deeper flavor. If you&#039;re short on time, just let it marinade for a minute and then move on to the next step. 
Set your air fryer to 350 F and air fry the tofu for 12-15 minutes. Shake the pan occasionally to promote even cooking. 
Serve the air fryed tofu immediately with vegan mayonnaise or aioli or with a salad.
