Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups brown or green lentils
1  small onion
1 stalk of leek
2  carrots
4 cups vegetable broth
2 medium potatoes
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste
1 tablespoon vegan margarine ((optional) )
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour ((optional) )
1 pinch of  nutmeg  ((optional) )
1/4 cup parsley, chopped

Instructions:
Finely chop the onion. Peel the potatoes and the carrots and cut them into cubes.
Thinly slice the leek into rings and discard the root end. Place into a colander and rinse well. Rinse the lentils with cold water as well.
Place the lentils, the carrots, the leek, and the onion into a large pot and add the vegetable broth. Bring to a boil.
After 15 minutes of cooking time, add the potatoes and cook for another 15 minutes.
You could either just season the lentil soup with salt and pepper or add some kind of an easy roux to make it a bit thicker. If you decide to add the roux, melt one tablespoon of vegan margarine in a small pot. Then add a tablespoon of all-purpose flour and a pinch of nutmeg and stir well with a whisk. Cook for about one minute on medium heat. Add it to the lentil soup.
Add chopped parsley right before serving.Â
