Ingredients:
1 cup of cauliflower florets
1/2 cup canned garbanzo beans ((drained and washed))
1/2  green bell pepper chopped
1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste
1/2 teaspoon chili flakes or to taste
1/2 teaspoon turmeric
1 tablespoon oil
1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds ((Saunf))
1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds ((Jeera))
1/2 teaspoon fenugreek seeds ((Raee))
1/2 teaspoon nigella seeds ((Methi))
1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds ((Kalonji))
2  garlic cloves chopped
1 teaspoon lemon juice
fresh Cilantro (for garnish)

Instructions:
Coarsely blend/grind the fennel, cumin, mustard, fenugreek and nigella seeds.
In a large pan, dry roast the blended spices on medium heat for a minute. You can dry roast the whole spices and grind and keep as well. For a more punjabi achari taste, add a bit more fennel and nigella seeds. Southern Indian Pickles use more of mustard and fenugreek seeds, so you can try adjust the spices according to taste!
Add the oil to the pan with spices and mix well.
Add in the turmeric and chili flakes and mix well.
Add in the chopped garlic and cook for a minute. (Garlic is optional)
Add in the cauliflower, garbanzo beans and green bell pepper and salt and mix well to coat.
Cook on low heat for 15-20 minutes stirring occasionally but lightly to avoid breaking the florets. Cook covered for 15 minutes and then partially covered for the next 10.
Serve hot, sprinkled with lemon juice and topped with chopped cilantro ! with some hot Roti/Chapati, Daal (lentil curry) and salad!
