Ingredients:
1/2 cup oat flour (use certified Glutenfree if needed. )
1/2 cup almond flour
1/4 cup potato starch
1 tsp baking powder
1/8 tsp baking soda
1/8 tsp salt
1/4 cup sugar
2 tbsp oil
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1/4 cup non-dairy milk
1/4 cup club soda
Cinnamon and Sugar

Instructions:
Mix all dry ingredients in a bowl. Â Almond flour tends to clump, if you run into this problem, just use a fork, spoon or hand to break down Ingredients until finely mixed.
Next take wet ingredients and incorporate into dry mixture. Again making sure to break up any lumps to get nice smooth consistency.
Let your batter sit for 5-7 minutes, it will grow in size and slightly thicken as well.
Spoon the batter into a WELL GREASED doughnut pan. This is a very delicate doughnut and if you have to force them out, they will likely break. Ideally you want them to just &#039;pop&#039; out, so make sure to generously grease the pan!
Put into a preheated oven at 375 F for 14-16 minutes.
Check at the 14-minute mark, depending on your oven they may cook more quickly.
Take out of the oven and let cool for 10-15 minutes before gently removing doughnuts from pan. Make sure they are completely cooled before topping.
