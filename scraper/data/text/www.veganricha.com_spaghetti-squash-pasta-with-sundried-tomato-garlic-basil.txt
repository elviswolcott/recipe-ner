2 tbsp fresh basil (plus more for garnish)
1 tsp dried parsley
1/3 cup chopped sundried tomato
1/3 tsp salt
black pepper to taste
2 tbsp or more vegan parmesan  (to taste for garnish or a crumble up my almond cheese ball)

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Pierce the spaghetti squash a couple of times. Then place on a baking sheet and bake for 45 minutes.&nbsp; (40 mins for smaller, 50 mins for larger). Check if a knife goes through easily. Remove from the oven and cool for a few minutes.
Slice the squash, then scoop out the seeds. Use a fork to make shreds. Scoop out the shreds in a bowl.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and cook for 2 minutes until lightly golden.
Add basil, parsley and sundried tomato and cook for a minute. Add a few tbsp of water and mix in. Bring to a boil.
Add the spaghetti squash, sprinkle salt, pepper and lightly toss. Serve garnished with pepper flakes, vegan parm or crumble up my 10 minute almond cheese ball and fresh basil. Store in the refrigerator for upto 3 days
