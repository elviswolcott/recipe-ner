Ingredients:
2 cups bread flour
2-3 cups all purpose flour
1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
1  flax egg
1 cup water
2 teaspoons sugar
1  packet quick rise yeast ((1.25 teaspoons))
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup orange juice

Instructions:
Warm 1/4 cup (60ml) water and add sugar and yeast to it . Mix well and keep aside for 10 minutes or until frothy.
Grease the mixer bowl and add in 2 cups (250g) bread flour and 2 cups (250g) all purpose flour and salt. Mix well.
Add in the oil , orange juice, water and yeast mixture and knead for 10-12 minutes( batches of 3-4 minutes and then scrape the bowl and wait for the mixer to cool a little if too warm)
Dough should be soft and pliable and non sticky.
Place dough in well oiled container, covered with plastic wrap in a warm place for 1.5 hours
Punch dough down and knead for a minute. Shape into loaf by pulling on all sides and tucking under. Use flour on hands to avoid dough sticking to hands.
Place loaf in well oiled bread pan and cover with a damp kitchen towel. Let rise for half an hour. Bake loaf at 375 degrees F for 35 minutes.
Cool completely before slicing. I usually place the cooled bread in the refrigerator for half an our before slicing with an electric knife for nice and clean slices!
