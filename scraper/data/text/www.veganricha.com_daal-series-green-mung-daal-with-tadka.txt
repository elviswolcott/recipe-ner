Ingredients:
2/3 cup green mung beans ((soaked 2 hours to a day))
2 cups water
1 teaspoon oil
1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds
pinch of asofetida
1/2 teaspoon coriander powder
5  curry leaves
5-6 cloves of garlic chopped
1  dry red chili pepper
1/4 cup onions chopped
1/4 teaspoon black pepper or to taste
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste

Instructions:
Rinse the soaked mung beans and pressure cook with 2 cups of water for 2 whistles. Wait for the pressure to go down by itself before opening the pressure cooker.
For the tempering, heat the oil in a medium pan on medium low heat until hot.
Add the mustard seeds. Once they start to sputter, add in the asofetida and curry leaves.
Add in broken dry red chili, garlic, coriander powder and turmeric and mix well.
Cook on medium low heat until the garlic starts to turn golden brown.
Add in the onions and cook for another 2 minutes.
Add the cooked beans to the tempering or the tempering to the beans pan and mix well.
Add salt and black pepper to taste and cook the beans soup for 3-4 minutes so that the soup can pick up the flavor of the tempering.
Serve hot with rotis or rice, garnished with fresh cilantro leaves!
