Ingredients:
6  Jalapenos - slit and seeds and pith removed
My Jalapeno Havarti Popper dip (or just the cream cheese Jalapeno dip or use other vegan cream cheese.)
1/2 cup almond milk  (or other non dairy milk)
1 Tablespoon flaxmeal
2 Tablespoon flour (wheat, unbleached white or spelt or other gf flour)
1/8 tsp salt or to taste
1/4 tsp garlic powder
2 tsp nutritional yeast
2 tsp extra virgin olive oil
1/2 to 3/4 cup bread crumbs
1/2 tsp smoked paprika
1/4 tsp garlic powder
1/8 tsp salt
1-2 tsp extra virgin olive oil (optional)

Instructions:
Prep the Jalapenos. (Use gloves if you are not sure about the spiciness. The seeds and pith can sometimes give a really bad spice burn). Remove the pith and seeds as much as possible.
Fill the jalapenos up with chilled cream cheese popper dip. (the chilled dip is quite thick).
Set up the breading area. Mix the milk with the spices, flaxmeal and flour in a deep down and keep ready.
Mix up the bread crumbs with paprika and salt and optionally add a tsp of oil and mix them up.
Dip Jalapenos with filled side up into the milk mixture (do not roll, just submerge them and lift out). Then immediately dip into the breadcrumb mixture. Use a spoon to sprinkle some extra breadcrumbs on top and press. Place the pepper on parchment lined sheet. Bake in preheated 350 degrees F / 180c for 25 minutes or until golden to your preference.
