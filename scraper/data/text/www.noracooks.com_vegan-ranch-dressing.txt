Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups raw cashew pieces
3/4 cup water
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
juice from 1 lemon (about 2 tablespoons)
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 cup fresh dill OR 2-3 teaspoons dried dill*

Instructions:
Soak the raw cashew pieces in hot water for 5-10 minutes. I heat up water in my electric kettle and pour it over the cashews to soak.&nbsp;
Drain the cashews and add to your blender. Add the remaining ingredients except the dill, and blend until very smooth.
Now add the dill, and pulse a few times to combine. You don't want to blend the dill or it will end up very green.&nbsp;
Serve on salad or with fresh vegetables for dipping. This will keep for up to a week in the fridge. It will thicken in the fridge, just thin out with water until it reaches the consistency you prefer.&nbsp;
