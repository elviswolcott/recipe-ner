Ingredients:
15 oz can chickpeas or 1.5 cups cooked
1/4 cup chopped red bell pepper
1/4 cup chopped celery
1/4 cup finely chopped red onion
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
3 tablespoons hot sauce (such as Frankâ€™s)
1-2 teaspoons white vinegar or apple cider vinegar
2 teaspoons oil or melted vegan butter
2 cups of finely chopped cabbage or you can also use lettuce
2-3 tablespoons vegan ranch ((see notes))
dash of salt and pepper
1 teaspoon lime juice
bread slices as needed or you can also assemble this in tacos (burritos, or wraps.)
baby greens as needed

Instructions:
In a bowl, add the chickpeas and mash until most of the chickpeas are mashed but there's still some texture.
Add in the bell pepper, celery, and onion and mix well.
In a bowl, mix the sauce ingredients until well combined.
Then add sauce to the chickpea mixture along with salt and garlic powder and toss well. Taste and adjust salt and heat. If you like more heat, you can add more hot sauce or you can add 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne.
To make the slaw, add the slaw ingredients to a bowl and toss well. Taste and adjust by adding more ranch if needed.
Assemble by placing some greens like baby spinach or some peppery greens on one bread slice.
Then add a good helping of the chickpea mash then top it with the slaw and add another bread slice.
