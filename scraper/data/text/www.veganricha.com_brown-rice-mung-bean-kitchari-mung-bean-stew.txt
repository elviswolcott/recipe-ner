Ingredients:
1/2 cup mung beans (dry whole green mung beans)
1/2 cup brown basmati rice
1/2 tsp oil
1/2 tsp cumin seeds
1/2 cup chopped red onion
2  medium tomatoes
5 cloves of garlic
1 inch ginger
1/2 tsp turmeric
1 tsp ground coriander
1/2 tsp garam masala
1/4 to 1/2 tsp cayenne
1/4 tsp black pepper
3.5 - 4 cups water (1/2 cup less for thicker)
1 tsp lemon juice
3/4 to 1 1/4 tsp salt

Instructions:
Soak the beans and rice for atleast 15 minutes. Soak at this step as the next few steps take 15 to 20 minutes
Blend the onions, tomato, garlic, ginger, spices with a few tbsp of water to a smooth puree and keep aside.
Start the Instant Pot (IP) on saute at normal heat.
When hot, add oil, let the oil heat up for a few seconds, then add cumin seeds. Roast the seeds for half a minute or until fragrant.
Add the puree carefully, stir and cook until the puree thickens and smells roasted. 15 to 17 minutes. Switch the saute to off.
Drain the beans and rice and add to the IP. Add water, salt, lemon juice. Mix. Add chopped veggies if you like.
Close the lid. Press Manual and adjust time for 10 minutes. (or pressure cook for 10 minutes after the pressure has released). * Brown Basmati Rice soaked for 15 minutes will cook in the 10 minute time. You might need to cook longer depending on the rice used (15 to 20 mins).
The IP will start heating, and show "On" and then count down the minutes when the pressure has reached.
Once done, let the pressure release naturally. Or if you are are in a hurry. Try the quick release after 5 to 7 minutes. * If the rice or beans are not cooked to preference, you can cook them on saute until they are tender.
Taste and adjust salt and spice. Serve hot with crackers or toasted bread.
