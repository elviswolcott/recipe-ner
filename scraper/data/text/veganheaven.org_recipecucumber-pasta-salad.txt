Ingredients:
10 oz spirelli pasta
1 1/2 cups unsweetened coconut or soy yogurt
1  English cucumber
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
3 tablespoons freshly chopped dill
1  red onion, cut into thin strips
2  cloves of garlic
1/2 teaspoon salt
black pepper, to taste

Instructions:
Cook the pasta according to the instructions on the package. Rinse with cold water after cooking.
Thinly slice the cucumber and cut the red onion into thin strips. 
Finely chop the dill and mince the garlic. 
Place all ingredients for the sauce into a small bowl and stir until well combined. 
Place all of the ingredients in a large bowl, add the sauce, and toss to combine. Serve immediately or store in the fridge for later. I think it tastes best when it sits for about 30-60 minutes after adding the sauce.
