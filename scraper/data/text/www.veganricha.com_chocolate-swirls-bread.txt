Ingredients:
2-3 cups bread flour
2 cups whole wheat flour
1.5 cups water
2 tablespoons vegan butter
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 teaspoons active yeast
2 tablespoons organic cocoa powder
oil (for greasing)

Instructions:
Warm half a cup (120ml) of water and add 1 teaspoon sugar and yeast to it. Mix well
Let it sit for 10 minutes or until frothy.
In 1/4 cup (60ml) hot water, mix in the cocoa powder and 1 Tablespoon sugar and keep aside for cooling.
Take 1/3 of the yeast mixture, 1 (or 1.5)cup bread flour, cocoa mixture, 1 teaspoon butter and knead into a soft dough.
In a greased mixing bowl, add the rest of the flours and salt and mix well.
Add the remaining butter, yeast mixture, and water and knead for 8-10 minutes. ( if using stand mixer, 3-4 minute batches with intermittent scraping)
Add more water if needed.
Place both doughs in separate well greased containers, covered in a warm place for 2 hours.
Knead the doughs separately into balls.
Take both doughs and roll them out into 10 or 12 inch squares of even thickness. The chocolate dough will be about 1/8 inch thick and the regular dough about a 1/4 inch thick. Use extra flour if necessary.
Place the chocolate dough on top on the regular dough square.
Fold them together twice to get a smaller square.
Roll them out again to about 10 inches square.
Roll them like a jelly roll from one side tightly and seal the open side to the roll with water.
Place the roll on a greased baking tray with the sealed side down.
Make deep cuts on the roll an inch apart. Step by step and pictorial for similar shaping here
Spray some oil on top and cover with damp towel. Let rise for 40 minutes.
Bake at 375 degrees F for about 40 minutes.
