Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce ((tamari for gluten free))
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 tablespoon pure maple syrup
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
2 teaspoons chili powder
14 ounce block firm tofu, patted dry
8-10  small corn or flour tortillas
Optional:  Vegan Sour Cream
Optional:  salsa, diced avocado, diced tomatoes, non-dairy cheese shreds, shredded lettuce, cilantro

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat.
In a large bowl, mix together the olive oil, soy sauce, tomato paste, maple syrup, onion powder, garlic powder, smoked paprika and chili powder. Now crumble the tofu into the bowl with your hands, and mix together using a large spoon until well combined with the paste.
Spread the tofu mixture evenly in the parchment lined pan. Place in the oven and bake for 15 minutes, then give it a little stir and bake for 15-20 more minutes, until the tofu is golden, crispy in places and chewy.
Remove from the oven and serve immediately in corn/flour tortillas with desired toppings.
