Ingredients:
1.5 cups cups bread flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup ground raw almonds
3/4 cup blueberries (I used fresh, use wild blueberries for a deeper color)
1/4 cup cup warm water
2 teaspoons active yeast
2 Tablespoons raw sugar or equivalent sweetener
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 Tablespoons organic canola oil or olive oil

Instructions:
Add the yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar to 2 Tablespoons warm water. Mix and let it sit until frothy. 10 minutes.
In a stand mixer, add the flours, salt, rest of the sugar and mix well.
Blend blueberries, and 2-3 Tablespoons water, into a smooth puree.
To the flours, Add in the blueberry puree , oil and yeast mixture and knead for 6-8 minutes. Scraping sides every 2-3 minutes. Or knead by hand for 5-6 minutes.
Add more water or bread flour if needed to make a well formed soft dough. The dough might be a little sticky, but should not be wet.
Place dough in well greased container. Spray water on top, cover and let sit in a warm place for 1.5 hours or until doubled.
Take dough out on a working surface. Using a little bread flour, knead for a minute, and then flatten it out into an inch thick rectangle. Roll it up like a jelly roll. Seal the edges. Place the roll seam side down in a well greased or parchment lined bread pan. Spray water on top. Sprinkle a little flour. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place for 45 minutes or until doubled.
Bake in pre-heated 365 degrees F for 35-40 minutes.
Remove from bread pan and cool on rack completely before slicing. Store in the refrigerator if not using up the same day.
