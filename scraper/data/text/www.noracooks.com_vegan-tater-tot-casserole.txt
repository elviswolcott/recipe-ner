Ingredients:
12 ounce package Impossible ground beef*
8 ounces cremini mushrooms, sliced or chopped
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon oregano
salt + black pepper, to taste
2 tablespoons all purpose flour (or gluten free flour)
13.5 ounce can light coconut milk*
1 tablespoon vegan Worcestershire sauce
1 1/2 cups frozen corn (or canned)
1 1/2 cups frozen green beans (or fresh/canned)
2 cups vegan cheddar cheese shreds*
32 ounce bag tater tots

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and lightly grease a 9x13 inch casserole dish.
Cook the Impossible meat in a pan until cooked through over medium-high heat, breaking it up with a spatula or wooden spoon as it browns.
Now add the sliced mushrooms and saut√©, stirring constantly, for about 5 minutes until they soften.
Add the cumin, oregano, plus salt and pepper to taste and stir.
Sprinkle in the flour and stir, then slowly stir in the coconut milk and add the Worcestershire sauce, corn and green beans. Stir well and simmer the mixture for 5 minutes.
Transfer mixture to the prepared dish, then layer on vegan cheese. Arrange the tater tots on top.
Bake for 30-40 minutes, uncovered, until the tots are golden. Serve immediately and enjoy!
Leftover tater tot casserole will keep in a covered container, refrigerated for up to 4 days. Reheat in the microwave until warm. It can also be frozen before baking. No need to thaw first, simply place it in the oven and cook until warm.
