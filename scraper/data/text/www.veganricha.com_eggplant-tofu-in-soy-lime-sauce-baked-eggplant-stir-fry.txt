Ingredients:
7 oz Tofu (, cubed)
4 to 5  small eggplants or 2 long eggplants (, sliced)
1/4 tsp salt
dash of pepper
1/2 tsp garlic powder
2 tsp cornstarch or use arrowroot starch
1.5 tbsp soy sauce (, use tamari for glutenfree)
1 tbsp chili garlic paste
1 tbsp lime juice
1 to 1.5 tbsp maple syrup
a good pinch of salt and pepper
1/2 tsp cornstarch

Instructions:
Place and oiled baking dish (stoneware or glass) in the oven. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a bowl, add the tofu and sliced eggplant. Spray oil or water. Add the rest of the ingredients and toss to coat. Take the dish out after 10 mins carefully. Spread the tofu and eggplant and bake for 30 mins.
Mix the sauce ingredients in a small bowl. Take the baking dish out of the oven and add the sauce to the dish. Mix to coat. (You can also add some quick cooking veggies to the dish at this point like thinly sliced carrots, peppers).&nbsp;
Bake for another 15 mins. Alternatively, transfer the baked tofu and eggplant into a skillet, add the sauce and cook over medium to bring to a boil and thicken. Serve over rice or cauliflower fried rice or noodles.
