Ingredients:
2 teaspoons vegan butter  (or oil)
2 tablespoons raw cashew pieces or other nuts like raw pistachios or almond slivers
2 tablespoons golden raisins or other dried fruit
seeds from 1 green cardamom
1  clove
a pinch of salt
1/2 cup vermicelli noodles (broken into 4 to 5 inch pieces, use Thai Rice vermicelli for gf)
2 cups almond milk  (or other non dairy milk)
2 to 3 tablespoons sugar or to taste
a drop of vanilla extract
1 to 2 tablespoon ground raw cashew (optional)
for variation: use 6 saffron strands or 1/2 tsp rose water instead of vanilla

Instructions:
Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. When hot, add cashews and cook until lightly golden on some edges. 1 to 2 minutes. Add raisins and cook until they puff up. Remove the cashews and raisins and keep aside.
In the same pan, add cardamom, cloves, salt and vermicelli noodles and cook over medium heat until the noodles turn golden. 4 to 7 minutes depending on the noodles used. Rice vermicelli takes longer to roast. Stir occasionally to avoid burning.
Add almond milk and bring to a boil.
Add sugar, vanilla and mix in. Reduce heat to low-medium and continue to cook until the noodles are cooked through. 5 to 7 minutes. Taste and adjust sweet.
Fold in half of the cashews and raisins. If the pudding is not thick, add ground cashew and mix in. Continue to cook for another 3 to 4 minutes or until desired consistency. The Pudding will thicken more once cool.
Garnish with the remaining cashews and raisins. Chill, discard the clove and serve.
