Ingredients:
14 oz extra firm or firm tofu pressed ((I usually use Nasoya Organic non gmo))
1 tbsp low sodium tamari/soy sauce
2 tbsp ketchup
1 tsp maple syrup or other sweetener
1/2 tsp hot sauce (optional)
2 tsp oil
1/2 tsp garam masala (or 1/2 tsp ground cumin and 1/2 tsp ground coriander)
1/2 tsp garlic
1/4 tsp salt
1/2  tsp cornstarch or tapioca starch ((optional, helps the breadcrumbs stick better during grilling))
3/4 cup breadcrumbs (, use gluten-free crumbs to make gf)
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 to 1/2 tsp cayenne
1 tbsp nutritional yeast (optional)

Instructions:
Slice the slab into 6 to 8 rectangles. Press the tofu for half an hour between kitchen towels and under a heavy weight to remove excess moisture. or use Tofu press (before or after slicing).
Mix the marinade ingredients. (Add 1/2 tsp cornstarch to the marinade for extra binding). Dip the tofu in the marinade and coat all sides to make an even coating that is not too thick or too thin. Place the tofu strips in a container with a lid.
Refrigerate for atleast half an hour or longer.
Mix everything under breadcrumb coating. If the breadcrumbs are too large, pulse them a few times in a blender and use.
Place each tofu strip in the breadcrumb mixture. Flip to coat all sides
Heat a grill pan over medium high heat on the stove. Brush oil on the pan and place the breaded tofu on the pan. Cook 7 to 9 minutes each side or until brown strips appear.
Serve with sauces of choice like vegan ranch or a dash of lemon, or slice and to salads, bowls, wraps, sandwiches, etc. Pictured with Butternut Squash Pilaf.
