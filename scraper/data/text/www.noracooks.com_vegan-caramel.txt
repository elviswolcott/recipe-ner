Ingredients:
1 cup coconut cream
3/4 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
optional: pinch of salt

Instructions:
In a small pan or pot, add the coconut cream, brown sugar and cornstarch. Heat over medium-high heat, stirring constantly while the coconut cream melts. The mixture will get bubbly and almost foamy. Lower the heat to a simmer and stir frequently for about 5 minutes. If you want salted caramel, add a pinch of salt.
Remove from heat. The caramel can be used immediately, or let it cool and it will thicken considerably. Each time you go to use it, give it a good stir. Store leftover caramel in a covered glass container in the refrigerator for about a week.
