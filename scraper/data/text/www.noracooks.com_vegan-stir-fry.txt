Ingredients:
4 ounces soy curls (half a bag)
3 cups water
2 1/2 tablespoons Butler Chik-Style Seasoning, optional
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 small onion, diced
1 medium zucchini, sliced and halved or quartered
2 cups broccoli florets
1 medium carrot, peeled and chopped
8 ounces mushrooms, sliced
1  red bell pepper, seeded and chopped into large chunks
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons fresh minced ginger
1/2 cup cashews or peanuts, optional
chopped green onions
sesame seeds
1/2 cup vegan no chicken broth (or vegetable broth)
1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce
1/4 cup water
1/4 cup agave
1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 tablespoon cornstarch

Instructions:
Prepare soy curls: In a large bowl, add the dehydrated soy curls, then cover with about 3 cups of warm water. Let them rehydrate for about 10 minutes until they have grown in size and softened. Drain in a colander and squeeze any excess water from the pieces.
Make the sauce: In a medium bowl, whisk together all the sauce ingredients. Set aside.
In a large sauté pan or wok, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil and heat over medium-high heat. Add the soy curls, optional chicken seasoning and stir fry for about 5 minutes. Transfer the cooked soy curls to a plate nearby.
To the pan, add an additional tablespoon of olive oil, then the onion, zucchini, broccoli, carrots, mushrooms and red bell pepper. Stir often for 2-3 minutes until crisp tender.
Add the garlic and ginger, and cook for another minute, stirring.
Add the soy curls back to the pan. Whisk the stir fry sauce one last time and pour over the soy curls and vegetables. Stir to combine; the sauce will thicken a bit.
Once the sauce thickens, remove the pan from heat. Stir in the cashews or peanuts, if using. Serve over rice or noodles with chopped green onions, sesame seeds and hot sauce, if desired. Enjoy!
