Ingredients:
2 heaped cups cauliflower florets
1/2 cup cashews
1/2 cup nutritional yeast
1 tablespoon tomato paste
2 teaspoons white miso paste
2  cloves of garlic
1/2 teaspoon turmeric
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
3 tablespoons tapioca starch
1/2 teaspoon paprika powder
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika powder
1 1/2 cups unsweetened almond or soy milk
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste

Instructions:
Cook the cauliflower florets for about 12-15 minutes. They should be pretty soft. Put the cashews in a small bowl and add some hot water from your kettle. Let them soak until the cauliflower is done.
Fill all ingredients into a high speed blender and blend until smooth and creamy.
Pour into a pot and cook for about 3-5 minutes until the vegan cheese sauce becomes creamy and stretchy. Enjoy with pasta (like mac and cheese), with nachos, or on vegetables.
