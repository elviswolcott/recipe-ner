Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup vegan butter  (such as Earth Balance)
3/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons natural vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
2 tablespoons soy or almond milk

Instructions:
In a mixing bowl, add softened vegan butter and sugar. Beat with a handheld or stand mixer for about 3-4 minutes on high speed until the butter sugar mixture is light and fluffy. 
Add the vanilla extract, the almond extract, and the soy or almond milk. Beat again on high speed until well combined. This should take about a minute. 
Now add the dry ingredients. Mix again on high until everything is well combined. Do not overmix the batter. Form a ball and cover it with plastic wrap. Place it in the fridge for 30 minutes. 
Lightly cover your kitchen counter with flour and roll out the dough with a rolling pin. 
Cut out the cookies with cookie cutters. I used star, heart, and Christmas tree shaped cookie cutters. Preheat the oven to 350 F. 
Line a baking tray with parchment paper and place the cookies on top. Bake for 8 minutes. As every oven is a bit different, check regularly, so they don&#x27;t get too dark.
