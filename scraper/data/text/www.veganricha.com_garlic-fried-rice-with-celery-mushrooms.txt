Ingredients:
2 teaspoons organic canola oil  (or any high smoke point oil or refined sesame oil)
8-10 cloves of garlic (chopped)
2-3 cups cooked Rice (or noodles or Quinoa)
2 cups vegetables  (I used onions, red and green bell peppers, celery, button mushrooms, broccoli, carrots and peas)
2 teaspoons Sesame oil (I used unrefined)
1 Tablespoon or more Soy sauce ( or soy-free Coconut aminos to taste or other vegan asian sauces of choice)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon raw sugar
1/4 teaspoon black pepper

Instructions:
In a wok or large pan/skillet, heat 2-3 teaspoons of a high smoke point oil of choice on high heat.
Add garlic and cook until golden.
Add onions and green and red bell peppers and mix. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally until brown on the edges.
Add mushrooms and celery and cook for another 2 minutes.
At this point, you can also add regular tofu or Soy-free tofu or steamed Tempeh for more protein, and cook for 2 minutes.
Add in the broccoli, carrots, peas, salt, black pepper and sugar. Reduce heat to medium, cover and cook for 3-4 minutes.
Add in cooked rice or noodles(or quinoa), soy sauce/liquid aminos and sesame oil.
