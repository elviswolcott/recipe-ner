Ingredients:
1/4 cup sweet sorghum flour (I useBob's red mill)
1/4 cup gf oats (ground)
4 Tablespoons potato starch
2 Tablespoon tapioca starch
2/3 teaspoon salt
2 tspÂ  raw sugar (ground)
1 teaspoon active yeast
1/4 cup + 2 Tablespoons water (if you boil potatoes and have some potato water, use that)
1/4 teaspoon vinegar
1 teaspoon coconut oil
1 Tablespoon extra virgin olive oil

Instructions:
Warm 2 Tbsp water and add yeast and a teaspoon of sugar, Mix well and let sit until frothy. 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, whisk the flours, salt, starches together.
Add the flours, rest of the sugar, and oils to the yeast mixture and mix.
Add vinegar to 1/4 cup water, and combine well to form a thick batter. Add a few drops of water if it feels dry.
Keep this batter covered in a warm place until doubled. 1.5 hours.
The batter will be doughy and less sticky after the rise. Oil hand and Use a teaspoon or so potato starch to help get the dough together and form balls.(adjust the dough to a soft not too sticky consistency at this point. If too dry, add some sprinkles of water and knead. If too wet, use a bit of potato starch to make it less sticky but not entirely like a dry bread dough)
Place balls in a parchment lined Stoneware container(I used 5 inch ramekin)
Spray top liberally with water and sprinkle seeds of choice.
Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled.
Spray top liberally with water and cover the container with foil to seal the steam in. Make a tiny hole on top.
Bake at 375 degrees F for 20-22 minutes.
Take foil off and let the rolls sit in the oven for a minute.
Remove from pan and parchment, cool for a minute and serve with some evoo or vegan butter.
