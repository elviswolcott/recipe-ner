Ingredients:
2  portobello mushrooms
1 teaspoon liquid smoke
2 teaspoons soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika powder
1 teaspoon maple syrup
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon vegan Worcestershire sauce
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste

Instructions:
Clean the mushrooms and slice them with a sharp knife.
&nbsp;In a small bowl combine the ingredients for the marinade (smoked paprika powder, soy sauce, liquid smoke, vegan Worcestershire sauce, and maple syrup). Season with salt and pepper. Whisk until well combined.
Put the sliced mushrooms in a bowl and pour the marinade over the mushrooms.
Carefully stir the mushrooms with a wooden spoon until they're completely marinated.
Heat some olive oil in a large nonstick pan on high heat (the mushrooms will shrink considerably during the cooking process). Add the mushrooms and drizzle another 1/2 teaspoon of soy sauce and 1/2 teaspoon of maple syrup on top. Cook for 3-4 minutes on each side.
Serve on a sandwich with vegan mayonnaise, lettuce, and tomatoes (vegan BLT) or with scrambled tofu or hash browns. Enjoy!&nbsp;
