Ingredients:
1 cup warm water, almost too hot for comfort (110 degrees)
1 envelope rapid rise or instant yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons)
1 tbsp sugar
2 3/4 cup white whole wheat flour
1/4 cup nutritional yeast
1 tsp salt
pizza sauce, or tomato sauce
non-dairy cheese, optional *I prefer daiya brand
vegetables of choice- green peppers, red onion, tomatoes, etc.
tempeh sausage, optional

Instructions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
Quick whisk the warm water, yeast and sugar in a large bowl, or your standing mixer bowl if using. Allow it to sit for 5 minutes, it should puff up a bit.
Add the flour, nutritional yeast and salt to the bowl. If using a standing mixer, use the dough hook on setting 2 for 5 minutes. If kneading by hand, mix everything together with a wooden spoon until combined, then knead on a lightly floured surface for about 5 minutes until you have a smooth ball of dough.
Halve the dough. On a lightly floured surface (I just use my countertop), roll out the dough pretty thin, about 11 inches in diameter or to fit your pizza pans. You should get two good sized pizzas.
If you don't have good non-stick pans, you may need to lightly spray them with oil to prevent sticking. Use as little as possible if needed. Transfer the dough to the baking pans.
Now you can add your pizza sauce, veggies and other optional toppings. Bake for 8 minutes for a soft, chewy crust or 10 minutes for a crispier crust.&nbsp;
