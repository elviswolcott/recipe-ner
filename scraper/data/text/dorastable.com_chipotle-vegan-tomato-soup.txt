Ingredients:
1 tablespoon Primal Kitchen Extra Virgin Olive Oil
1  yellow onion, (thinly sliced)
1  red bell pepper, (sliced)
1 can (14.5 oz) roasted diced tomatoes
1 jar  Primal Roasted Garlic Marinara Sauce
1  chile chipotle pepper in adobo, (chopped)
4 cups vegetable broth
1 tablespoon butter
 cup Almond Crema
 cup chopped cilantro

Instructions:
Heat oil in a large heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Stir in onions and cook until they begin to brown and caramelize, about 6 minutes. Stir in bell pepper and cook until they have softened, 3 minutes.
Add the chipotle pepper and cook for 2 more minutes.
Pour in the roasted diced tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Pour in the roasted garlic marinara sauce and simmer for 3 minutes.
Pour in the vegetable broth and bring everything to a simmer. Simmer for 15 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Process until smooth in the blender or use an immersion blender right in the pot. Serve hot and garnish with almond crema, and chopped cilantro. Pair this with a vegan grilled cheese or sourdough bread fried in butter.
