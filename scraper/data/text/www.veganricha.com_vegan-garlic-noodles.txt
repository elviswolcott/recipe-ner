Instructions:
Cook your spaghetti according to the instructions on the package. Boil a large pot of water and once boiling, add a good helping of salt and add the spaghetti and cook until al dente.
Meanwhile, to make the sauce, heat the butter or oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once starting to get hot, add in your garlic and cook until the garlic is starting to get golden on some edges. Stir frequently to avoid burning.
Then add in the turmeric and pepper flakes and mix in. Then add in soy sauce, oyster sauce, brown sugar, and mushrooms and mix well.
Cook for 2 minutes and add in the sesame oil, green onions, and vegan parmesan and mix in.
Add in a 1/4 cup to 1/3 cup of the pasta water and mix in. Then mix your pasta and toss well to coat. Then take off of heat.
Taste and adjust salt and flavor then plate. Add some more vegan parmesan on top and some green onions and serve immediately.
