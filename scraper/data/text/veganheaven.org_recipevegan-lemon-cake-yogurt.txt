1/2 cup powdered sugar
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon water

Grease the bundt pan with vegan margarine and lightly dust with flour. Melt the margarine in a small pot.
In a large mixing bowl, combine all ingredients and stir with a wooden spoon. Pour the dough into the bundt pan and bake for about 40 minutes. Use a toothpick to check if the cake is ready. Leave in the pan for 10 minutes. Then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.
Meanwhile make the glaze: Combine the powdered sugar, the lemon juice, and the water and stir well. Once the cake has cooled, pour the glaze over the cake and sprinkle with the remaining lemon zest. Enjoy!
