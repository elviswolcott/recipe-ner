Ingredients:
9 oz spaghetti
4 tablespoons pesto rosso (red pesto with sun-dried tomatoes) (use a store-bought vegan one or use homemade vegan pesto)
10  sun-dried tomatoes in oil
10  artichoke hearts in oil
4 tablespoons pine nuts
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1-2 handful fresh basil
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste

Instructions:
Cook the spaghetti according to the instructions on the package. Rinse with cold water after cooking and set aside.&nbsp;
In the meantime, roughly chop the sun-dried tomatoes and the artichokes.&nbsp;
Put the pine nuts in a frying pan without oil and cook them over medium heat for about 3 minutes. Stir them frequently until they're golden. Make sure not to cook them for too long as they burn easily.&nbsp;
Roughly chop the basil or rip it by hand.&nbsp;
In a large bowl, combine the cooked spaghetti with the pesto, the sun-dried tomatoes, and the artichokes. Stir in the lemon juice and season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with the chopped basil and the roasted pine nuts.&nbsp;
