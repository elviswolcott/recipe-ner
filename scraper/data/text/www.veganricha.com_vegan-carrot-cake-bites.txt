Ingredients:
2 cups chopped carrots
3/4 cup walnuts
15  soft dates ((regular size), use 2 less if using large medjool)
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp ginger
1/8 tsp nutmeg
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 cup almond flour (add more if needed)
3 tbsp coconut flour
2 tbsp shredded coconut  (for coating)

Instructions:
Chop the carrots into 2 inch pieces. Add to a baking dish, cover the dish with parchment (optional) and bake for at 400 deg F (200 C) for 20 to 25 mins(longer time for fatter carrots). (You can skip this step and use raw carrot, you will need a few tbsp more almond flour later).
Add walnuts to a food processor and pulse to chop into an even coarse mixture
Add the roasted carrots, dates, vanilla, spices and salt and process until the mixture is well combined and doughy.
Add the almond and coconut flours and pulse again to combine. (You can also add other ingredients such as chia seeds, some vanilla protein powder etc instead of some of the almond flour)
If the mixture is too sticky, add a few tbsp more almond flour and 1 tbsp more coconut flour and pulse. Taste and adjust flavor with a tbsp of coconut sugar or maple syrup for sweeter if needed, or add more spices.&nbsp;
Shape into balls and roll in shredded coconut. Alternatively, drizzle some vegan cashew cream cheese frosting or,&nbsp; 3 tbsp coconut butter mixed with 1 tbsp of maple syrup, a good pinch of lemon zest and cinnamon.
Store refrigerated for upto a 5 days or freeze.
