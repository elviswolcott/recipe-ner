Ingredients:
2 pounds brussels sprouts
3 tablespoons olive oil
3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon  pure maple syrup
1 teaspoon salt
4 cloves garlic, roughly chopped

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Spray a large baking sheet with oil or line with parchment paper.
Prepare the brussels sprouts: Slice the stem off the brussels sprouts and slice them in half lengthwise.
Make the sauce: In a large bowl (large enough to hold all the brussels sprouts as well as the sauce), whisk together the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, maple syrup, salt and garlic.
Add the trimmed brussels sprouts to the bowl with the sauce and toss very well to coat. You could mix this all in the pan, but I find tossing them in a bowl first coats the sprouts better and improves the texture and flavor.
Add the coated brussels sprouts to the prepared pan, and turn them all to face down. This will help them stay more moist inside, while making them perfectly golden and crispy on the outside.
Roast for 20-25 minutes, until golden brown, a little crisp on the outside and still tender on the inside. Cooking time will vary depending on the size of your sprouts; large ones will take longer to cook. Serve immediately.
