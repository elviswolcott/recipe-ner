Ingredients:
2 tsp extra virgin olive oil
1/2 cup chopped onion (red, or white)
2 cups or more grated broccoli or broccoli slaw
1 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp onion powder
1/4 tsp black pepper
1/3 tsp ground cumin
1/2 tsp ground coriander
1/4 tsp or more cayenne
2 tbsp or more nutritional yeast
3/4 tsp or more salt
3 tbsp chopped fresh basil or dried basil to taste
1/4 cup cashews (soaked for 15 minutes or longer (1/3 cup for creamier))
2 cups or more non dairy milk (unsweetened)
cayenne for garnish

Instructions:
Heat oil in a saucepan over medium low heat. Add onions and a dash of salt and cook until mostly translucent. about 6 minutes.
Add the shredded broccoli and spices. Mix and cook for 1 minute. Mix in the nutritional yeast and salt. I used some broccoli stems and some florets and processed them in a food processor to get about 2 cups grated broccoli.
Blend the cashews and basil with 1 cup non dairy milk until smooth. Blend a couple of times if the cashews were not soaked. Add to the saucepan. Add the rest of the non dairy milk and mix in. Bring to a boil. About 5 mins. If the soup starts to thicken too much or needs more liquid. Add 1/4 to 1/2 cup or more water and mix in. Taste and adjust salt and spice.
Simmer for another 3 to 5 minutes or until desired consistency. Garnish with cayenne or red pepper flakes. Serve with warm garlic bread or crackers.
