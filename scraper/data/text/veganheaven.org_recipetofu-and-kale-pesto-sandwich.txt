Ingredients:
3 handfulls kale
1/2 cup walnuts
1  clove of garlic
3 tablespoons nutritional yeast
5-6 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon Italian spice mixture (oregano, basil, rosemary, thyme, and sage)
salt
black pepper
7 oz smoked tofu (Alternatively you can also use marinated regular tofu)
1 small zucchini, cut into slices
1  carrot, spiralized
lettuce
2  whole wheat buns

Instructions:
First make the kale pesto: Put all ingredients into a blender of food processor and blend until smooth.
Cut the tofu into thin stripes. In a medium pan, heat some olive oil and stir-fry the tofu for about 2-3 minutes on each side until it is brown and crispy. If you want you can also add about half a teaspoon of soy sauce. Once the tofu is done, put it aside.
Heat some more olive oil and cook the zucchini slices for another 3 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and Italian spices (such as oregano, basil, rosemary, thyme).
Cut the sandwiches in half and generously coat both sides with kale pesto.  Add the lettuce, the tofu, the carrots, and the grilled zucchini.
