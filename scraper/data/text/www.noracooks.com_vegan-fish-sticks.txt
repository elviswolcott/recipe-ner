Ingredients:
(2) 14-16 ounce blocks extra-firm tofu
1/2 cup all purpose flour
1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice (about 2 lemons squeezed)
1/2 cup unsweetened non-dairy milk ((I used soy))
1 1/2 cups breadcrumbs
1-2 packages seaweed snack sheets
1/2 teaspoon salt

Instructions:
Press the tofu by wrapping in paper towels (or a clean dry tea towel). Place a plate or pan on top of the wrapped tofu, and put a couple of heavy books on top of that. Let the tofu press for at least 30 minutes and up to an hour.
For Baking: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and lightly grease a large pan (I used spray oil).
Once the tofu is done pressing, slice it into sticks. Add the flour to a bowl, then coat the tofu sticks in the flour. Set the flour-coated tofu sticks on a cutting board or other clean surface while you prepare the rest of the coatings.
In another small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, lemon juice and non-dairy milk. Set aside.
In a blender or food processor, add the breadcrumbs, seaweed snack sheets and salt. Use two full packages for a fishier taste, or one package for a less fishy taste. Blend until the sheets are broken down and it is all well combined. Add to a bowl.
Dip the flour-coated tofu sticks into the wet mixture, then immediately coat in the breadcrumb/seaweed mixture.
To Bake: Place on the greased pan and bake for 40 minutes, flipping once halfway through, until crispy and golden.
To Fry: Heat a large pan (cast iron preferred) over medium-high heat. Fry the tofu in a fair amount of oil, for 3-4 minutes on each side, until golden brown and crispy.
Serve vegan fish sticks with Vegan Tartar Sauce, ketchup and with a side of potato wedges or fries. Enjoy!
