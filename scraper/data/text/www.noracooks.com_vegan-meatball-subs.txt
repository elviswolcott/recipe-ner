Ingredients:
1 recipe Chickpea Meatballs
6-8  sandwich rolls (check ingredients to ensure vegan)
1 jar your favorite pasta sauce (or make your own, about 3 cups)
1  bag non-dairy mozzarella style cheese shreds* (OR use homemade vegan mozzarella)

Instructions:
Make the Chickpea Meatballs if you haven't already. I like to double the recipe and use 1 batch for spaghetti another night. Or make them ahead of time and freeze for easy weeknight meals.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
Add the chickpea meatballs to a large pot on the stove and cover them with the pasta sauce. Warm over low-medium heat, coating the meatballs with the sauce.
Fill a roll with meatballs (3-4, depending on the size of your balls). Top with a little more sauce from the pot. Place the rolls close together on a baking sheet and top with non-dairy cheese shreds or homemade mozzarella.
Bake for about 15-20 minutes, until the cheese is melted and hot. Remove from oven and serve. Enjoy!
