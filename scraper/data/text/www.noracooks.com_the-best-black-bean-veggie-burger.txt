Ingredients:
1/4 cup ground flax
1/2 cup water
3 cups cooked black beans (2 15-oz cans, drained and rinsed)
1 cup cashews (*see notes for options)
1 1/2 cups cooked brown rice
1/2 cup chopped parsely
1 1/2 cups shredded carrots
1/3 cup chopped green onions
1 cup bread crumbs (*see notes for gluten free)
2 tablespoons smoked paprika
1 tablespoon chili powder
1-2 teaspoons  salt, to taste
burger buns of choice
lettuce, arugula, spinach or other leafy greens
tomato slices
red onion slices
vegan mayo, mustard, ketchup, pickles
vegan cheese slices

Instructions:
In a small bowl, combine the ground flax and water. Give it a little stir and set aside. This is your flax egg mixture.
In a large bowl, add the drained and rinsed black beans. Mash with a potato masher (or fork) until most of the beans are a paste. Leave about 1/4 of the beans whole.
Place the cashews in a food processor, and pulse until they are breadcrumb size, NOT a powder. It&#039;s okay if a few larger pieces remain. You could instead chop them with a large knife. Add to the bowl with the beans.
Now add the flax/water mix to the bowl with the beans/nuts as well as all the remaining ingredients. Mix very well with a large wooden spoon. 
Using about 1/2 cup per burger, shape into burger patty shapes about 3/4 inch thick.
