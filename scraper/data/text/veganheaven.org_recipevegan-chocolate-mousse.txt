Ingredients:
1 cup liquid from canned chickpeas  ((aquafaba, chickpea cooking water))
5 oz dark chocolate
2 tablespoons brown sugar or coconut sugar ((reduce the amount of sugar if the chocolate you&#039;re using is already pretty sweet) )

Instructions:
Roughly chop the chocolate and either melt it in the microwave or over the stovetop. 
Whip up the aquafaba. Place it in a kitchen machine or whip it up a with a handheld mixer. It will take about 10 minutes to get stiff peaks.
Once you&#039;ve reached stiff peaks, add the sugar while still whipping. 
Transfer the whipped up aquafabe to a large bowl. 
Once the dark chocolate is melted, let it cool down significantly. It should still be thin and runny but not too warm or hot anymore. Add it to the whipped aquafaba. 
Carefully fold it into the aquafaba using a whisk or a spatula. 
Evenly divide the mixture between four glasses and place it in the fridge overnight to set. 
On the next day, serve it with vegan whipped cream, chopped dark chocolate, and raspberries.
