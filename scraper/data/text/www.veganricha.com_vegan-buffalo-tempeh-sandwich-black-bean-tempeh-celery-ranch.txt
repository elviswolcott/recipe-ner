Ingredients:
8 oz pack of Black Bean Tempeh ( or other Tempeh)
1 cup water
2 tsp blackening spice
1 tsp oil
1 Tbsp Sriracha sauce  (or to taste)
2 tsp hot sauce  (or to taste)
1/2 tsp vinegar

1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil
a very generous dash of black pepper
1 tsp ranch seasoning (or equal quantity of parsley, dill, thyme, garlic and onion)
1/2 tsp celery seeds

Instructions:
Slice the Tempeh to make 2 patties. Place the patties in a large skillet with a cup of water and blackening spice. Cook on medium heat for 14 to 17 minutes or until all the water is gone. Flip the patties mid way.
Add oil and toss to coat. Continue to cook at medium heat until some of the edges are crisp. Add the Sriracha, hot sauce and vinegar. Toss to coat and cook for a few seconds so the sauce heats up.
Place on sandwich, layer with greens/lettuce, tomato, celery ranch and serve. Make 2 sandwiches.
For Celery ranch, blend everything under celery ranch until smooth. Taste and adjust flavors and use.
