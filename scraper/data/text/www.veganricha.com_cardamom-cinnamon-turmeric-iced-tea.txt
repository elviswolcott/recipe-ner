Ingredients:
2.5 to 3 cups water
1 to 2 tsp loose tea (depends on the tea brand and how strong you like the tea, or use tea bags)
1/4 tsp chai spice (or use a very generous pinch of cardamom and cinnamon and a dash of black pepper)
1/2 tsp grated ginger
2 tbsp or more sugar (raw sugar, coconut sugar or other sweetener)
1 tbsp maple syrup
1 cup coconut milk ( or other non dairy milk)
1/8 to 1/4 tsp turmeric
1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tbsp sugar (raw or coconut or other sweetener)
Ice cubes

Instructions:
Add all the tea ingredients to a saucepan and bring to a boil. Simmer for 2 minutes. Strain and set aside. Once cool, taste and adjust sweet and spice to preference. Chill until ready to serve.
Mix the coconut milk with turmeric, cinnamon and sugar. You can also heat the milk to a boil to incorporate the turmeric and flavors better. Cool and chill until ready to serve.
Fill glasses with ice cubes in tall glasses (2 to 3 glasses depending on size).
Pour tea into the glasses to fill three quarters of the way.
Add some turmeric milk. Serve immediately. This tea also tastes amazing with just plain coconut milk.
