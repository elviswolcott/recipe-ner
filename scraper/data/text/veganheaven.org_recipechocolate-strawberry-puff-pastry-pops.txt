Ingredients:
6 sheets vegan frozen puff pastry (without butter)
1/2 cup strawberry perserve
9 oz vegan dark chocolate
4 tablespoons brown sugar

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 Â°F. Let the frozen puff pastry sheets thaw for about 5 minutes.
Then lengthwise cut each sheet into 4 stripes. Evenly coat each stripe with strawberry preserve, roll them up, and put them on bamboo skewers. Alternatively, you can also use vegan chocolate spread as a filling.
Line a baking tray with parchment paper and put the puff pastry pops on top. Bake for 10 minutes.
In the meantime, melt the dark chocolate either in the microwave or on the stove top. Let the puff pastry pops cool down for about 5 minutes, then drizzle the melted chocolate on top and sprinkle with some more sugar. Enjoy!
