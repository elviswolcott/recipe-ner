Ingredients:
1/2 cup split yellow mung Daal ((skinned and split green Mung))
1/2 cup split Toor Daal ((dark shiny split pigeon pea))
2 teaspoons canola oil
1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds
1/4 teaspoon cumin seeds
1/4 teaspoon coriander seeds
5  curry leaves
pinch of asofetida
1/4 teaspoon turmeric
1/2 inch ginger finely chopped
3 cloves of garlic finely chopped
1  green chili finely chopped
1   tomato chopped
salt to taste
cilantro leaves for garnish

Instructions:
Soak the both daals together for about 2 hours. Drain the water, wash and keep aside.
In a pressure cooker, add the daals and 2 cups water. Add a few drops of oil and the turmeric and cook on medium heat for one whistle. Take the cooker off heat and wait for the pressure to release on its own(10 minutes)
For the tempering, heat oil in a large pan on medium heat.
Add the mustard seeds and wait till they splutter.
Add in the cumin seeds and coriander seeds and mix all for a few seconds.
Add in the asofetida and curry leaves. Watch out for oil splattering because of the curry leaves.
After a few seconds, add in the chopped ginger garlic and chili and mix well.
Cook the mixture till the garlic gets golden. 3-4 minutes
Add in the tomatoes, and cook the mixture till the tomatoes lose their shape. 4-5 minutes.
Add the cooked daals to this mixture and mix well.
Add salt, mix and cook for 6-7 minutes until the daal is boiling nicely.
Garnish with chopped cilantro leaves and serve hot with Chapatis, roti, Naan or Basmati Rice!
