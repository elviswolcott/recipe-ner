Ingredients:
9 oz spaghetti
3  cloves of garlic
1/4 cup olive oil
1  red chili
1/4 cup freshly chopped parsley

Instructions:
Cook the spaghetti according to the instructions on the package. 
In the meantime, finely chop the garlic, the chili, and the parsley. You could also mince the garlic with a garlic press if you want. 
In a large pan, heat the olive oil on low heat. Add the garlic and the chili and cook on low heat for about 3 minutes. Make sure the garlic isn&#x27;t getting to dark. It&#x27;s important for the flavor that you slowly heat it in the oil. 
Add the cooked spaghetti and stir well. Season with salt and pepper and sprinkle with the chopped parsley. If you want to you could also add some fresh lemon juice. Enjoy!
