Ingredients:
1 tbsp. Oil ((optional))
8 oz. Angel hair pasta or whole wheat thin spaghetti, (broken into 1 in. pieces)
1 can (14.5 oz) Diced tomatoes or 2 cups of fresh diced tomatoes
1/2  Onion, (white, chopped)
3  Garlic cloves, (peeled)
10 cups Vegetable stock
1  Mexican zucchini, (diced)
1  Lime, cut into quarters

Instructions:
In a medium pot get your vegetable stock boiling hot and set aside.
Set a large pot to medium heat and add oil. Once the oil is hot add broken up noodles and toss to coat in oil. Continue to cook until noodles are golden brown, about 3 minutes.
While the noodles are browning, place the tomatoes, onion, garlic, and 2 cups of the vegetable stock in the blender and process until smooth.
Strain this mixture directly into the golden noodles still in the hot pot. Stir to prevent the noodles from sticking.
Let mixture simmer for 1 minute. Add the rest of your stock and set heat to high. Add zucchini and cook noodles at a low boil until noodles are al dente and zucchini is tender. Stir often. Season.
Serve with a wedge of lime so everyone can add as much lime juice as they like.&nbsp;
