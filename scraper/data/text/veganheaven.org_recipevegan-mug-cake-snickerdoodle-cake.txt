Ingredients:
1/4 heaped cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
2 tablespoons brown sugar
3/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 cup almond or soy milk
2 tablespoons vegan margarine
1 teaspoon natural vanilla extract
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon

Instructions:
Melt the margarine in a little pot on the stove top. Combine the ingredients in a small bowl and stir well. Pour the batter into a mug. Sprinkle some more sugar and cinnamon on top and microwave the vegan mug cake for one and a half minutes.
Let it cool down for a few minutes. It's best when you eat it warm right out of the mug. Enjoy!
Note: The mug I used is around 3 inches high and 3 inches wide.
