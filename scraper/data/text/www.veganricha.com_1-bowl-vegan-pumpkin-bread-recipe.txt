Ingredients:
1 cups flour (I use all Spelt flour or 1 cup whole wheat pastry flour + 3/4 cup unbleached white)
 cup powdered sugar (Use 2 tbsp more for sweeter ( just blend up unrefined sugar of choice until fine and use))
 cup brown sugar or coconut sugar or other sugar of choice
2 tsp baking powder
 tsp baking soda
 teaspoon salt
2 to 4 tsp pumpkin pie spice (or use 11/2 tsp cinnamon,  tsp ginger,  to  tsp nutmeg,  tsp cloves)
3 to 4 tbsp chopped walnuts or pecans or omit to make nut-free
3 tbsp mini chocolate chips or craberries or currants
1 cup + 2 Tbsp pureed pumpkin (not pumpkin pie mix)
 cup non dairy milk
3 to 4 Tbsp oil
1 tablespoon molasses or use maple syrup
1 tsp lemon juice
pumpkin seeds or vegan mini chocolate chips for topping (optional)

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 365 degrees F / 180c.
In a large bowl, whisk the dry ingredients until well combined. Mix in the nuts and chocolate chips if using. *If your coconut sugar has large granules, pulse in a blender to grind to finer state and use.
Add the wet ingredients and mix well. it will take a minute or 2 for the pumpkin puree to combine well. Mix until there are no pumpkin or flour streaks in the mixture. Add a tbsp more non dairy milk if needed.
Transfer to a parchment lined or well greased and floured loaf pan. Top with chocolate chips or pumpkin seeds or a streusel of choice.
Bake for 50 to 60 minutes or until the toothpick from the center comes out almost clean.
Cool for 15 minutes then remove from the pan. Cool completely before slicing. Store on the counter for the day or refrigerate for upto 6 days.
