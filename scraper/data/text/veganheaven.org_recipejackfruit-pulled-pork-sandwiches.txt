Drain and rinse the jackfruit. Remove the core and put in a mixing bowl. Stir in the spices (paprika, cumin, brown sugar) so the pieces are nicely covered.
In a medium pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Saut√© the onion for about 3 minutes or until it becomes translucent. Then add the garlic and cook for another minute.
Add the jackfruit and cook for about 3 minutes. Then add the BBQ sauce, the liquid smoke (if using),  and the vegetable broth and cook for another 15- 20 minutes. Use a fork to shred the jackfruit.
