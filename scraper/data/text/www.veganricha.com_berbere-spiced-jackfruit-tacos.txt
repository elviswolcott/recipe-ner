Squeeze the jackfruit in between paper towels to remove as much liquid as possible. It is ok if it squishes.

Transfer to a bowl and mix in the spices and sauces well. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.&nbsp;
Spread the mixture on a parchment lined baking sheet so its an even layer.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 35 to 40 minutes. Mix and spread after 20 minutes to move the center portion out. Also taste at this time for salt, heat and flavor. Adjust if needed and mix in.
