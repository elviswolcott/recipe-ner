Ingredients:
1  onion, chopped
2 cups mushrooms, cut into small chunks
2  cloves of garlic, minced
1/2 cup rolled oats
1/2  carrot, grated
2 cans black beans
1/2 cup chopped parsley
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon paprika powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
pepper
1 tablespoon tamari
1/2 cup wholemeal bread crumbs
red pepper flakes

Instructions:
Heat some oil in a large pan and sauté the onion for 2-3 minutes. Then add the mushrooms and the garlic. Cook for 3 more minutes.
Rinse the black beans.  In a large bowl, mash the black beans with a fork, leaving some black beans partially intact for texture. Add the rest of the ingredients and combine well using your hands. Either form four large or six smaller burger patties.
You can either heat some oil in a pan and cook the burger patties for 2-3 minutes on each side or you could make them on the grill.
Alternatively, you could also make them in the oven. Preheat the oven to 350 °F, line a baking sheet with parchment paper and put the patties on top. Bake the black bean patties for about 15 minutes. Carefully flip them halfway through the baking time.
Serve them on burger bun (I used a whole wheat one) with lettuce, tomato, cucumber, and red onion.
For the sauce, you could either use ketchup and mustard or BBQ sauce. Or you could try my vegan sriracha mayonnaise, which I also like to use for this vegan black bean burger. I originally made the sriracha mayo for my red lentil potato fritters, so just scroll down to the recipe box in this post.&nbsp;
