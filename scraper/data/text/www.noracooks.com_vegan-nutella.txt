Ingredients:
1 cup whole raw hazelnuts
1 cup vegan chocolate chips*
1-4 tablespoons powdered sugar, optional for added sweetness

Instructions:
Toast the hazelnuts: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Spread the hazelnuts in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake in the oven for 10 minutes, until fragrant.
Place the hazelnuts in the center of a clean dish towel, then wrap them up and rub vigorously for a few minutes to remove some of the skins. They won&#x27;t all come off, and that is fine!
Add the still-warm hazelnuts to a high powered blender (or food processor). Blend and grind the nuts until moist, crumbly and almost a paste. Scrape down the sides as needed, I usually stop and scrape 2-3 times. This will take a little longer in a food processor (5-8 minutes) than a high powered blender (3-5 minutes).
Melt the chocolate: In a microwave safe bowl, add the chocolate chips and microwave in 30 second intervals, stirring in between, until completely melted and smooth. You can also melt the chocolate in a double broiler.
Add the chocolate to the blender with the hazelnut paste. Blend until very smooth, scraping down the sides a few times as needed. Taste, and add powdered sugar if desired for additional sweetness.
Pour into a jar and store at room temperature for up to 2 weeks. If you put it in the refrigerator, the nutella will get very hard so I don&#x27;t recommend it. It may get hard even at room temperature, especially if your house is cold. If it&#x27;s too firm, warm in the microwave for 20-30 seconds and it will soften right up.
