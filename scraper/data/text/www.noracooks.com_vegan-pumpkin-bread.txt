Ingredients:
1 tablespoon ground flaxseeds
2.5 tablespoons water
15 ounces (1 1/2 cups) canned pumpkin puree
1 1/4 cups brown sugar
1/2 cup canola oil
1/4 cup soy milk
1 3/4 cups all purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 cup pepitas

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and grease a loaf pan.
In a small bowl, combine the ground flaxseed and water. Set aside to thicken; this is your flax egg.
In a large bowl, whisk together the pumpkin, brown sugar, canola oil, flax egg and soy milk until smooth.
Add the flour, then sprinkle the baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves on top of the flour. Stir with a large spoon or spatula, gently, until just combined. Do not over mix.
Pour into the prepared pan and sprinkle the pepitas on top. Bake for about 1 hour and 15 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Let it cool in the pan for 10-15 minutes, then transfer the loaf to a cooling rack. Slice carefully right away, or let cool completely for easier slicing and serving.
