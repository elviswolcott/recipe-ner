Ingredients:
1/2 cup water
1/3 cup blueberries
1/4 cup coconut sugar  (or brown sugar)
1/2 cup sugar
1 tbsp flax seed meal (optional)
1/3 to 1/2 cup loaded cup vegan dark chocolate  (or vegan semi sweet chocolate chips. About 2.5 oz)
3 Tbsp oil
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 cup flour (I use half wheat half white)
1/4 cup almond flour
1/4 cup cocoa powder
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/4 cup vegan chocolate chips
1/4 cup blueberries

Instructions:
Prepare your brownie pan by lining with parchment or greasing. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F / 180c.
Add water, blueberries and sugars to a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil. Simmer until all the blueberries break apart and the mixture starts to thicken (about 5 to 6 mins). You can use a spatula to mash the berries so they cook through.
Take off heat and Cool the mixture for a minute or so. Add the flax meal and chocolate and mix until the chocolate melt. Add the oil and vanilla and mix to combine. Let the mixture cool further to until warm to touch.*
Meanwhile, mix the flours, cocoa, baking soda and salt in a bowl until well combined. Add the chocolate chips and blueberries and mix.
Add the dry to the wet and mix until just about combined. Drop the thick batter into the prepared brownie pan. Press the batter into the pan using a spatula or oiled hands. Press in 2 tbsp or more of chocolate chips or slivered almonds on top.
Bake for 20 to 22 minutes. Check with a toothpick an inch from the edge. the center might be liquidy but the toothpick from the edge should come out clean or not liquid.
Cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then remove from the pan and cool on the cooling rack for another 10 minutes before slicing.Serve warm with vegan ice cream of choice
