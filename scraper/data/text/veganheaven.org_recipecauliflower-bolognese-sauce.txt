Ingredients:
1  small head of cauliflower
1  onion, chopped
2  cloves of garlic, minced
3 tablespoons tomato paste
1 large can diced tomatoes (27 oz)
2 teaspoons dried Italian herbs (I used thyme,basil, rosemary, and oregano)
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2  cup fresh basil, chopped
salt
pepper

Instructions:
Break the cauliflower into medium-sized florets and put about 1/4 of the florets in a food processor. Pulse about 2-3 times until the cauliflower looks crumbly. If you don't have a pulse function, use the lowest setting. Add the remaining florets in several rounds. You don't want to add too much at once. Alternatively, you could also use a grater but this takes much longer.
In a large pan, heat some oil and saut√© the onion for about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for another minute.
Stir in the cauliflower and the tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes. Then add the diced tomatoes and the herbs and cook for 6 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and serve with whole wheat spaghetti and chopped basil. If you want you can also add vegan Parmesan cheese. Enjoy!
