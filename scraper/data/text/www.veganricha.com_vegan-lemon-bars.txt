Ingredients:
3/4 cup oat flour (plus 2 tablespoons )
1/2 cup almond flour
2 tablespoons cane sugar  (or any granulated sugar)
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup maple syrup
1 teaspoon flax seed meal  (mixed with 1 tablespoon non-dairy milk)
1 cup raw cashews  (soaked in hot water for at least an hour)
1 cup coconut cream
1 teaspoon cornstarch (, optional)
1 tbsp  lemon zest  (zest of a lemon)
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup sugar
1/2 cup lemon juice

Instructions:
In a bowl, add all the dry ingredients for the crust and mix well.
Then add in the maple syrup and flaxseed milk mix. Press and mix to a make a dough. Press this dough into a parchment-lined 9x5 inch loaf pan and even it out. You can also use an 8x8 inch brownie pan.
Bake in a 350 Fahrenheit (180c) oven for 12-14 minutes or until the center is starting to firm up.
Meanwhile, make the filling. Blend the drained cashews, coconut cream, corn starch, lemon zest, salt, sugar, and lemon juice until very smooth. You want to blend it at least 3 or 4 times for atleast 30 seconds for the cashews to break down into smooth cream. Taste and adjust sweetness.
Pour this mixture onto the baked crust. Even it out. Then place in the fridge to set. You can also put it in the freezer for  an hour so that it&#39;s easier to slice.
Remove it from the freezer and slice it into slices, and serve!
You can store it in the refrigerator for 5 days. And freeze for upto 2 months. Thaw on the counter for 15-20 mins before serving
