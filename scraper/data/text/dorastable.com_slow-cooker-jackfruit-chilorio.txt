Ingredients:
2  (20 oz) cans Green Jackfruit in Brine, rinsed and drained
2-3  Ancho Chiles, stemmed and seeded
2 cups Water
1 1/4 cup Orange juice
2 tbsp. Apple cider vinegar
1/2 medium White Onion, roughly chopped
4  Garlic, cloves
1/2 cup Parsley
1 tsp. Mexican oregano
1/4 tsp. Cumin
Salt and Pepper to taste

Instructions:
In a small saucepan, add the chiles and cover with the water. Bring to a boil and then turn off the heat. Cover and let the chiles rehydrate for 10-15 minutes. Reserve ½ cup of the chile cooking liquid.&nbsp;
To a blender, add the chiles, ½ cup chile cooking liquid, orange juice, vinegar, onion, garlic, parsley, oregano and cumin. Blend until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.
Add the drained jackfruit to a slow cooker. Pour the blended chile puree over the jackfruit. Stir, making sure all the jackfruit is coated in the sauce. Cook on low for 3 to 4 hours.&nbsp;
Using two forks, shred the jackfruit. Cook for another 30 minutes to 1 hour. Season with salt and pepper.&nbsp;
Serve with warm tortillas.&nbsp;
