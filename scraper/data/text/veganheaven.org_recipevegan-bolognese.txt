Ingredients:
14 oz firm tofu
1  onion, finely chopped
3  cloves of garlic
3 tablespoons tomato paste
1/4 cup red wine
2  carrots, finely diced
2 stalks of celery, finely diced
3 cups tomato puree in a jar
3/4 cup vegetable broth
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil
1/2 teaspoon soy sauce
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste
red pepper flakes, to taste (optional)

Instructions:
Crumble the tofu with your hands. In a large pan, heat some olive oil and add the crumbled tofu. Cook on high heat for 5 minutes until crispy and golden. 
In the meantime, finely dice the onion, the celery, and the carrots. 
Add the onion to the tofu and cook on high heat for 3 minutes until translucent. Then add the garlic and cook for another minute. 
Now add the tomato paste and stir well so everything is covered in tomato paste. Cook for 2 minutes. 
Deglaze with red wine and cook for another minute. Then add the celery and the carrots and cook for 5 minutes. 
Add the pureed tomatoes, the vegetable broth, the basil, the oregano, and season the sauce with salt and pepper. Turn down the heat to medium-high and let it simmer for 10-15 minutes. Serve it over freshly-cooked pasta, and sprinkle it with roughly chopped basil leaves and vegan Parmesan. Enjoy!
