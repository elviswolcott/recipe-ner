Ingredients:
2-2.5 cups cabbage finely chopped
1 teaspoon organic canola oil or mustard or sesame oil
1/2 teaspoon brown mustard seeds
1 teaspoon chopped green chili or to taste
3 cloves of garlic chopped
a generous pinch of asafoetida (hing)
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
1 Tablespoon of split lentils of choice (not whole( urad daal-black gram, chana-bengal gram or toor- pigeon pea))
2/3 teaspoon salt or to taste

Instructions:
In a large pan, add oil and heat at medium.
Add mustard seeds when hot and mix for a few seconds.
Add asofetida(hing), garlic and chili and cook for a minute.
Add the lentils/daals and cook for a minute or so, until the lentils and garlic turn golden. Sometimes I soak the lentils for 5 minutes before adding for a non smoky taste. You can skip the lentils and add half teaspoon of cumin and coriander seeds.
Add turmeric powder and cabbage and mix well.
Cook covered on low heat for 5 minutes.
Stir, add salt and cook partially covered for 10+ minutes, stirring occassionally, until cooked to your preference(also depends on the size of the chopped cabbage).
For variations, add peas, chopped carrots or boiled potato, to the cabbage when you add salt. Or change up the spices, use cumin seeds or fennel or just a little garam masala!
Serve hot topped with fresh cilantro or coconut flakes, as a side with Daal soups and Roti or Naan-Indian flat bread or Rice.
