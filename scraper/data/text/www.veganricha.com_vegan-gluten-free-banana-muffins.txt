Ingredients:
2  medium bananas - very ripe
2 tbsp maple syrup
2 tbsp non dairy milk
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 tsp vinegar (apple cider vinegar or white vinegar or use lemon juice)
2 tbsp oil
1/3-1/2 cup sugar (I usually use a 1/3 cup with very ripe bananas for a lightly sweet muffin)
1/3 cup almond flour/meal
1/2 cup certified gf oat flour or use other gluten-free flours like sorghum or rice flour
1/4 cup starch (I use 2 tbsp tapioca starch and 2 tbsp potato starch.)
3 Tbsp coconut flour
1/2 tsp xanthan gum
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
3/4 tsp or more cinnamon
1/3 cup or more chocolate chunks

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F / 200c.
In a bowl, mash the bananas really well. Add the rest of the ingredients under wet and mix until the sugar is well combined.
In another bowl, whisk all the dry ingredients except the chocolate chunks, until well combined.
Mix the dry into the wet until well combined. Fold in the chocolate chunks.
Drop the batter into lined muffin pan.
Bake at 400 degrees F / 200c for 20 minutes, then reduce temperature to 375 and continue to bake for 5 to 7 minutes. Check at the 23 or 24 minute mark. Toothpick from the center should come out almost clean.
Let the muffins rest for 2 minutes then remove from the muffin pan and let them cool on a cooling rack lightly covered by a kitchen towel. Store on the counter for the day and refrigerate for upto 5 days
