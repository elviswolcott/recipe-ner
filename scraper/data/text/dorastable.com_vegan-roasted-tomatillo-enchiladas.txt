Ingredients:
1 tbsp. Vegetable oil (optional)
1/2  Onion (thinly sliced)
2 cloves Garlic (minced)
1 cup Corn (kernels)
1/4 cup Vegetable stock
2  Poblano peppers (roasted, peeled, cut into strips)
1 cup Pinto beans (canned)
1/2 cup Almonds (raw)
1/4 cup Soy milk (unsweetened)
1 clove Garlic
1 tsp. Lemon (juice)
12  tortillas
3 cups Tomatillo salsa (see note)
1/2  Onion (sliced into paper thin rings)
1 tbsp. Cilantro (chopped)

Instructions:
Preheat oven to 350F.
To make the filling: heat 1 tbsp. of oil in a large sauté pan to medium-high heat. Once oil is hot, add onions and sauté for 3 - 4 minutes, or until almost the onions are tender and translucent. Add the garlic and cook for 1 more minute.
Add corn and 1/4 cup of vegetable stock. Cover and cook for 2-3 minutes or until the corn is tender. Add poblano pepper and beans and mix well. Season with salt and pepper.
To make the almond crema: place all ingredients in the blender until smooth. Season with salt and pepper and set aside.
To assemble: Warm corn tortillas in the microwave for 30 seconds or in the oven at 350F on a sheet tray for 5 min. Just enough so that the tortillas are soft enough to be rolled.
Spread 2-3 tbsp. of the tomatillo sauce on the bottom of a 9 x13 baking dish Place 1 tbsp. of filling on each tortilla. Roll and place on baking dish. Continue this process until you have used up all the tortillas and the entire filling.
Pour the rest of the tomatillo sauce on top of the enchiladas and bake in oven for 5 – 10 min. or until the enchiladas are warm. Remove from the oven and drizzle almond crema on top.
Garnish with onion slices and chopped cilantro.
