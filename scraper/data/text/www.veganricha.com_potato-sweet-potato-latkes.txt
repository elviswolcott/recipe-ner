Ingredients:
2  medium russet or yellow potatoes about 2 lbs
1  small sweet potato, peeled if you like
1/2  yellow or red onion
3/4 tsp salt
1/2 tsp black pepper, divided
1/8 tsp cayenne
2 to 3 tbsp potato starch
1/2 tbsp flour or chickpea flour(for eggy flavor)  (or more starch)
Other additions: some dill (, scallions, 1 tsp mustard. For spiced latkes, add some garam masala or berbere spice blend. )
3 tsp organic safflower or canola oil ( to pan fry)

Instructions:
Shred or grate your potatoes and onion. I use a hand grater for the potatoes and processor for sweet potatoes, you can also use a spiralizer. Add to a bowl, add a pinch of salt and mix. Then use paper towels to wrap the mixture and squeeze to remove the excess moisture.
Add salt, 1/3 tsp black pepper, cayenne, starch and flour to the potatoes and mix in. The potatoes dont need much binding as they will cook and stick.
Heat a cast iron or heavy bottom skillet over medium heat. Brush oil. Place spoonfuls of the mixture and press lightly and spread.
Cook over medium heat for 3 to 5 minutes per side. If the potatoes are browning too quickly, reduce the heat a bit.&nbsp;
Garnish with black pepper, salt, pepper flakes. Serve warm with vegan sour cream or apple sauce or other toppings.
