Ingredients:
6  bell peppers ((or 4 very large) )
2 cups cooked rice
1  small red onion, chopped
2  garlic
1 can kidney beans
1 teaspoons paprika powder
1/2 teaspoon cumin
12 oz veggie ground meat
2 cups diced tomatoes
tabasco, to taste
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste
1/2 cup vegan cheese
2  green onions, sliced
2-3 tablespoons freshly chopped parsley

Instructions:
Finely chop the red onion and the garlic. Heat some oil in a large pan and sauté the onion for 2-3 minutes until it becomes translucent. Then add the garlic. Cook for another minute.
Then add the cooked rice, the beefless veggie ground meat, the canned diced tomatoes, and the kidney beans. Season with paprika powder, cumin, salt, pepper, and tabasco. Cook for 5 minutes.
In the meantime, remove the tops, seeds, and the membranes of the bell peppers and discard. Place the peppers in a baking dish.
Spoon an equal amount of the rice mixture into the bell peppers. Sprinkle with vegan cheese. Then carefully add some water or vegetable broth (3/4 cup) to the bottom of the baking dish.
Preheat your oven to 350 °F and bake the vegan stuffed peppers for 30 minutes. Sprinkle with freshly chopped parsley and green onions after baking. Serve immediately.
