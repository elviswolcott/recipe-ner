Ingredients:
thinly sliced cauliflower (1/4 inch or less)
halved broccoli florets
sliced zucchini
sliced red bell pepper
sliced red onion
baby spinach  (or other baby greens)
Oil as needed
vegan mayonnaise of choice ( I used Nasoya Light)
prepared mustard   (I used Jalapeno mustard)
sriracha or ketchup
bread slices ( or baguette or hoagie roll)

Instructions:
Heat a large grill pan on medium-high heat. Drizzle a little oil and spread on the pan.
Place the sliced veggies on the pan. Cook until well grilled. Flip and grill a bit more. Grill till tender crisp.
Broccoli and Cauliflower take longer to get grilled. About 8-10 minutes. I used small Broccoli Florets and sliced them into halfs. Other veggies get done in 6-8 minutes.
Grill or toast the bread slices. Spread mayo on both sides of the bread slices.
Layer some spinach/greens. Top with red onions, Zucchini, bell pepper. then Broccoli and Cauliflower.
Sprinkle salt and pepper. Add mustard and Sriracha or ketchup to taste. Serve hot.
If roasting in the oven, toss veggies in oil, salt and pepper and bake at 425 degrees F until tender crisp. 15-25 minutes.
