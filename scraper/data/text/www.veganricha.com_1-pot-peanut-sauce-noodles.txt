Ingredients:
2 1/4 cup water
6 oz brown rice noodles (pad thai noodles or other noodles or use angel hair pasta)
1/2 cup or more sliced carrots
1/2  of a large red bell pepper sliced
4  oz cubed tofu (3/4 cup)
2 tbsp scallions (chopped (optional))
2 to 3 tsp sriracha (I usually add more)
2 to 3 tsp soy sauce (use certified gf if needed)
1/2 tsp garlic powder  (or use 2 tsp minced garlic or both)
1 tbsp ginger paste or minced ginger
3 tbsp or more almond butter  (or peanut butter)
1 tsp lemon or lime juice
1/2 tsp white vinegar
1 tbsp or more sugar  (or other sweetener)
1/4 tsp salt or to taste
cayenne to taste (1/3 tsp or more)
1/2  loaded cup chopped celery  (or bok choy)
2 tbsp or more cilantro or basil  (or both for garnish)
roasted peanuts for garnish (optional)

Instructions:
Add water to a saucepan.
Add noodles and push them down so they are covered in water. Arrange veggies on the sides or top of the noodles. I added a chopped green chile as well.
Add tofu and the rest of the ingredients through cayenne.
Bring the pot to a boil over medium heat. Stir occasionally really well to make sure the nut butter mixes in and the noodles cook evenly. Once boiling well, add in the celery and mix in. Cook for another minute or 2. Check the noodles for doneness, Taste and adjust sweet, heat and lemon.
Fold in cilantro, basil, or baby spinach if using. Let sit for another minute before serving. Garnish with peanuts or sprouts and a dash of fresh lime. We added a good dash of red pepper flakes as well.
