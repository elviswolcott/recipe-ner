Ingredients:
2 cans chickpeas
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon smoked paprika powder
1  teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt

Instructions:
Drain the canned chickpeas. Then dry them really well using a clean dishtowel. Just gently roll them between the dishtowel. You could also use paper towel.
In a medium bowl, toss the chickpeas with olive oil. We'll add the spices after baking because they have a tendency to burn. So don't worry about them for now.
Preheat your oven to 350 F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Spread the chickpeas on the baking sheet and bake for 25 minutes.
Then take the chickpeas out of the oven and place them in the bowl you used before. Add the spices and toss well until the chickpeas are coated evenly.
Return them to the baking sheet and bake for another 10 minutes until they're browned and crunchy.
