Ingredients:
1 pound dried black eyed peas
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium sweet onion, diced small
2 ribs  celery, diced small
1  red bell pepper, diced small
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon smoked paprika
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
few shakes of black pepper
4 cups vegetable broth
salt, to taste
chopped parsley, optional for topping
3-4 cups chopped collard greens or kale, optional

Instructions:
Rinse the peas and discard any that are discolored or broken. Add the peas to a large pot, along with 4 cups of water and bring to a boil. Boil for 2 minutes, then cover the pot, remove it from the heat and let soak for 1 hour without lifting the lid.
Once hour has passed and the peas have softened, drain them and set aside.
In the same pot you soaked the beans in, warm the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion, celery, red bell pepper and garlic and cook for 4-5 minutes until the onion is translucent and the vegetables softened.
Now add the smoked paprika, thyme, red pepper flakes, black pepper, the softened peas and 4 cups of vegetable broth. Stir well and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 1-1 1/2 hours, stirring every 30 minutes. If desired, add chopped greens in as well and let them cook with the peas. When the mixture is soft and a bit creamy, it is done.
Add salt to taste, and a few splashed of hot sauce if desired.
Divide into bowls and serve with a side of collard greens (unless you added them right into the pot!) and cornbread. Sprinkle with parsley. Enjoy!
