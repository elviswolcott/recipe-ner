Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups cornmeal
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup unsweetened soy or almond milk
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
1/4 cup melted vegan butter
1 cup corn kernels

Instructions:
Combine the dry ingredients (cornmeal, flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and brown sugar) in a large bowl and stir well. 
Melt the vegan butter in a small pot on the stovetop or in the microwave. Then add it to the cornmeal flour mixture together with the unsweetened plant-based milk and the apple cider vinegar. Stir with a wooden spoon until well combined, but don&#x27;t overmix. 
Add the corn kernels. Stir well. 
Generously grease an  8 or 9-inch square baking dish with vegan butter. Pour the prepared batter into the dish and evenly divide it with a spatula. 
Preheat the oven to 400 F. Bake the cornbread for 20-25 minutes. 
Allow the cornbread to slightly cool before slicing and serving. Serve with butter or maple syrup. Enjoy!
