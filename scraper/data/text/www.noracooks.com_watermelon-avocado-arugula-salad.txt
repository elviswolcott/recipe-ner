4-5 ounces arugula (about 5 cups packed)
2 cups cubed watermelon
1-2 medium avocados, chopped into 1 inch chunks
1/2 medium red onion, sliced
4-5 tablespoons high quality balsamic vinegar (Grand Reserve preferred)
2 tablespoons sliced almonds, optional

Prepare all your salad ingredients by gathering the arugula, cubing the watermelon and slicing the avocados and red onion. Keep ingredients separate until ready to serve.
