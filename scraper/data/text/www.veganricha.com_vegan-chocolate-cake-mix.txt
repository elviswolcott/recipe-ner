Ingredients:
3 cups whole wheat pastry flour
3 cups unbleached flour
4 1/2 cups coconut sugar (or 4 cups organic sugar)
1 1/2 cups cocoa powder (not Dutch-processed)
6 tablespoons very finely ground coffee (espresso grind)
2 tablespoons baking soda
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon sea salt

Instructions:
Sift together all of the ingredients into a large bowl, then using a wire whisk, mix well until the mixture looks perfectly combined. Alternatively, you can use an electric mixer or food processor. Store in an airtight container or ziplock bags at room temperature for 3 to 4 months.
For the doughnuts: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F / 180Âºc. In a bowl, combine 1/2 cup boiling water with 2 tbsp oil, 1 tsp vinegar and 1/2 tsp vanilla. Add 1 cup + 2 tbsp of the cake mix and whisk for at least 30 seconds. Pour the batter into greased doughnut pan and bake for 14 to 16 minutes. Cool slightly, then remove from pan. Cool completely and glaze.
The glaze I used is vegan chocolate melted in a little coconut milk. Double dip and let set.
