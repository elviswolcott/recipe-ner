Ingredients:
2  Poblano Peppers
1 (15 oz.) can Chickpeas, drained (rinsed)
2 1/2 - 3 tbsp. Tahini
3 tbsp. Olive Oil
1  Garlic, clove (peeled)
2 tbsp. Lemon, juice
2 tbsp. Lime. juice
3-4 tbsp. Water
1/2 tsp. Sea Salt, or taste
1/4 cup Toasted pine nuts for garnish (optional)
1 Pinch Cilantro for garnish (optional)

Instructions:
Roast the poblano peppers on a comal or heavy skillet over medium heat. Cook until blackened, turning the chiles often. Depending on the thickness of the comal or skillet, it can take 15-20 minutes until all sides of the chiles are blackened.
Once the chiles have blackened, transfer them to a plastic ziploc bag and let them steam for 15-20 minutes. Once the chiles have steamed, peel off the skin. Them cut a slit along the side of the chile and remove the seeds and veins. Roughly chop the chiles and add to a high speed blender or food processor.
Add the chickpeas, tahini, olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, lime juice, water and salt to the blender or food processor. Blend until completely smooth, scraping down the sides as necessary. Add a tablespoon of water if needed.
Taste for seasonings.
Refrigerate until ready to serve. If using toasted pine nuts to garnish, add them to the hummus just before serving. Serve with chips or assorted veggies.&nbsp;
