Ingredients:
1 cup cashews
1  cup unsweetened almond or soy milk
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon frozen dill
1 teaspoon frozen parsley
1/2 cup Frank&#039;s Red Hot Buffalo sauce
1 cup vegan cream cheese
2 cans young green jackfruit in brine or water

Instructions:
First rinse the jackfruit and cut off the core. With your fingers or a fork shred the jackfruit.  
Place the cashews, the unsweetened soy or almond milk, the nutritional yeast, the garlic and onion powder, the frozen dill, frozen parsley, and salt and pepper into a highspeed blender. Process until smooth. 
Pour the blended cashews sauce into a bowl. Add the vegan cream cheese, the Frank&#039;s Red Hot Buffalo sauce, and the frozen parsley and dill to the cashews sauce. 
Add the shredded jackfruit and stir well. Either serve the dip cold or preheat your oven to 350 F and bake it for 10-15 minutes until it&#039;s heated through.
