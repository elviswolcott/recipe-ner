Ingredients:
2 tablets (tablillas) Hernan Mexican chocolate
2 cups Almond-coconut milk, (unsweetened)
1  Avocado (ripe, cut in half, flesh removed)
2 tbsp. Sugar or maple syrup

Instructions:
Bring the coconut-almond milk to a very low simmer over low heat. Add chocolate tablets and sugar, and stir with a whisk or molinillo.
Once the chocolate has dissolved pour it in a container and let it cool completely in the fridge or freezer.
Place the chocolate mixture, avocado, and sugar in the blender, and puree until smooth.
Pour into popsicle molds, snap on the lids, and freeze for at least 5 hours.
