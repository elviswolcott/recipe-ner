Ingredients:
2 cups fresh or bottled carrot juice (make sure itâ€™s 100% carrot juice)
2 cups coconut milk
2 Tbsp. pure maple syrup
1 tsp. ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp. ground ginger
1/8 tsp. ground cloves
1/8 tsp. cardamom
5 Tbsp. kuzu root powder
Whipped coconut cream (for topping, optional)
Golden raisins (for garnish, optional)

Instructions:
Combine all ingredients in a bowl or a large measuring cup. Remove 1/2 cup of the liquid and pour the remainder of the mixture into a small saucepan. Whisk together the 1/2 cup of the mixture and 5 tablespoons kuzu root powder and stir until completely dissolved. Set aside.
Bring the mixture in the saucepan to a boil and whisk in the reserved liquid. Whisk constantly until the pudding begins to thicken. Remove from the heat and let sit for a few minutes while you get 6 glasses or bowls. Divide the liquid between the glasses and place them in the refrigerator to set, 4-6 hours.
