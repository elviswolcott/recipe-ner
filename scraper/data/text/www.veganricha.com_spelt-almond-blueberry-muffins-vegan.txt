1.5 tsp baking powder

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F / 200c. In a large bowl, mix all the dry ingredients and keep ready. In another bowl, mix the almond milk, flax meal, yogurt and let sit for 2 minutes. Add the rest of the ingredients and mix well. Add the wet to the dry and and mix till just about combined. Do not over mix. Toss the blueberries in the maple syrup to coat and then add to batter. Mix to just combine. Spoon the batter into lined or greased muffin pan. Bake for 18-19 minutes or until a toothpick from the center comes out clean.
