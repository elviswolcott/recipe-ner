Ingredients:
3/4 cup heated non dairy milk (such as almond, soy, light coconut or oat)
3/4 cup sweet potato puree
2 tbsp oil
1 tsp vinegar (apple cider or white)
3 tbsp maple syrup or sugar of choice
3 to 3.5 cups flour
1/2 tsp salt
2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/3 to 1/2 cup brown sugar
2 tsp cinnamon
2-3 tbsp oil

Instructions:
In a bowl, mix in all of the wet ingredients until well combined.
In another bowl mix all the dry ingredients really well.
Add 2.5 cups of flour mixture into the wet and mix well. Depending on the consistency of your sweet potato puree/ mash and the sweetener used, you will need few tbsp or up to a cup of flour to make the mixture into just slightly sticky dough. You don’t want to overwork the door as the more you mix and knead , sweet potato purée will leak more moisture)
As soon as the mixture is dough like, bring it together. Cover the bowl with a towel and let it sit for least half an hour.  The dough will rise a bit.
Transfer the dough on a working surface and using some flour, Lightly roll it out into 11x15 inch rectangle.
