Ingredients:
12 to 14 oz firm Tofu (pressed for atleast 10 mins to remove excess moisture.)
2 tbsp soy sauce (or use tamari for glutenfree)
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp ginger powder
1/4 cup peanut butter
6 to 7  dates (pitted)
2 to 2.5 tbsp lime juice
2 tsp soy sauce
2 tsp minced ginger
6 oz Vermicelli or Maifun Rice noodles (cooked according to instruction on the package)
2 to 3 cups chopped lettuce
julienned or thinly sliced carrots
peeled and sliced cucumber
1 cup mint leaves
1 cup packed cilantro

Instructions:
Slice everything as needed. Prepare the noodles according to instruction on the package, rinse in cold water and set aside.
Bake the tofu: Slice the pressed tofu into thin slices. Place in a shallow bowl (or directly in a baking dish). Drizzle the soy sauce all over. Sprinkle the garlic and ginger powder, flip around to coat and let sit for 10 mins. Place in a baking dish. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20 to 25 mins. (Variation: use 1 Tbsp vegan hoisin sauce and 1 tbsp soy sauce). Slice when cool into desired bite size pieces based on how you plan to serve.
Blend everything under peanut sauce with 1/2 cup of water. Taste and adjust salt, sweet (add some maple syrup or sugar if needed), tang (adjust lime).
Assemble in a bowl or wrap with good portions of the lettuce, noodles, mint, cilantro, cucumber, carrots and baked tofu. Drizzle the sauce generously and also serve some on the side.&nbsp;Or if you are up for up, make fresh rolls with spring roll wrappers! Dip the rolls in Peanut Sauce and enjoy
