Ingredients:
1/2 cup uncooked red lentils (washed, drained and picked for stones)
1 cup water
1/2 tsp oil
1.5 Tbsp ground sugar (divided)
a pinch of salt
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1/4 cup shredded coconut
3 to 4 tablespoons dried cranberries  (or use other dried fruit or raisins)
oil as needed

Instructions:
In a pan, add the washed lentils, water and 1/2 tsp oil and cook at medium heat. The water will come to a boil and continue to bubble. Stir once or twice in between to ensure the lentils cook evenly. Take off heat as soon as the lentils start fraying or feel tender in the middle. 8 to 9 minutes. check a few lentils to be sure.
Drain excess water, rinse and drain for 2 minutes. Squeeze them lightly in a paper towel if too wet. They should be moist so they can hold the sweet and spices, but not wet.
Pre-heat the oven to 320 degrees F / 160c. Transfer the lentils to parchment lined baking sheet. Add 1/2 to 1 Tbsp of ground sugar, salt, cinnamon and mix in. (Use less sugar if you like your granola less sweet). Add in the vanilla extract and mix. Spread the lentils to a thin layer. Bake for 20 minutes.
Add another 1/2 Tbsp sugar, mix into the lentils and move them around, spray oil on the lentils and turn the tray. Bake 15 minutes or longer. Check to see if most of the lentils are crisp. If the lentils start to brown too quickly, reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees F / 150c.
Add coconut and cranberries, spray oil and mix in and bake for 5 minutes or longer till the lentils are crisp. they should be crisp, light and crunchy. Cool completely before storing. Serve as you would serve other granola. Goes well with non dairy yogurt. or make granola bars.
