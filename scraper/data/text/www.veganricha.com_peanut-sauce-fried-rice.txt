Ingredients:
3 to 4 tbsp smooth peanut butter or almond butter (I usually use almond butter)
1 inch piece of fresh ginger (coarsely chopped)
2 cloves of garlic
2 tsp soy sauce (or use coconut aminos to make soy-free)
1 to 2 tsp lime juice
zest of ½ a kaffir lime  (or regular lime)
2 tbsp chopped cilantro
2 to 3 teaspoons Sriracha sauce or asian chili sauce (to taste)
¼ tsp or more cayenne
¼ tsp salt
1 Tbsp or more sugar or other sweetener
½ tsp sesame oil
1/4 cup or more coconut milk  (or other non dairy milk)
2 tsp oil
1/2  red onion thinly sliced
3 cloves of garlic finely chopped
1/2 cup sliced carrots
1/2  red pepper thinly sliced
7 oz Tofu pressed and cubed (or use more veggies or cooked chickpeas)
3/4  cup loosely packed chopped cabbage  (or other veggies like broccoli)
2.5  cups cooked rice or other grains of choice (I usually use half brown and half white rice)
salt to taste
red pepper flakes or cayenne as needed
lime or lemon juice to taste
1/4 cup loosely packed chopped cilantro for garnish

Instructions:
Blend all the ingredients under peanut sauce until smooth. Taste and adjust spice, salt, sweet. Keep aside.
In a skillet, heat oil over medium high heat. When the oil is hot, add the onions and a pinch of salt. Toss and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.
Add the garlic, carrots and bell pepper. Toss well and cook for 2 minutes.
Add the Tofu and cabbage, toss well and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.
Add the peanut sauce and mix well. Reduce heat to medium. Cover and cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until the sauce starts to bubble.
Add in the cooked rice and salt. Mix well. Taste and adjust salt and spice. Add cayenne or red pepper flakes to taste. If the rice feels too dry, sprinkle in some non dairy milk and mix well. Cover and cook for a minute. Let the rice sit covered for another few minutes.
Add a good dash of lemon or lime juice. Garnish with cilantro and red pepper flakes or cayenne. Serve hot.
