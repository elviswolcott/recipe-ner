Ingredients:
1  medium eggplant (cubed)
1  summer squash (cubed)
1  zucchini (cubed)
1  red bell pepper (chopped into 3/4 inch slices)
1/2  onion (chopped, or thinly sliced)
2 tsp olive oil
1 tsp dried oregano
1 tsp dried basil (or 2 tbsp fresh basil)
1/2 tsp dried thyme
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp black pepper
15 oz can of tomatoes (or 3 tomatoes, chopped)
1/2 cup polenta (or grits)
2 cups of water (or broth)
1/2 tsp salt
2 tsp nutritional yeast
1 tbsp vegan butter

Instructions:
Chop all the vegetables and add to a baking dish. Use a baking dish that is large enough that all the vegetables are in a single layer.
Drizzle the oil all over over, then mix in. Add in the herbs, salt, and pepper, and mix in, and spread again.
Bake at 400 degrees F ( 205 c) for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the eggplant is almost done.
Add in your tomatoes, and mix in, and bake for another 10-15 minutes so that the tomatoes start to get tender.
In the meanwhile, make your polenta by heating up the water until hot, then add in the polenta gradually while whisking. Add in salt nutritional yeast, vegan butter, and mix in. Continue to cook until the polenta is cooked to preference.
Remove the baking dish from the oven, and then taste and adjust flavor.
Serve the baked ratatouille over the polenta in bowls. Sprinkle some pepper flakes, fresh basil, or parsley.
