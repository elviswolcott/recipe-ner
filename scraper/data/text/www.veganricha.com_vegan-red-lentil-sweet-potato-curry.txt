Ingredients:
½ cup  red lentils (picked over, rinsed, and drained)
3¼ cups  water (,divided)
1 teaspoon organic safflower or other neutral oil
¾ cup  coarsely chopped onion
4 cloves garlic (finely chopped)
1 /2 inch fresh ginger, peeled and minced or grated (1/2-inch [1cm] )
3 tbsp  red curry paste
2 cups cubed sweet potatoes
1-2 cups assorted veggies such as  (peppers, or zucchini, broccoli or a mix )
13.5 oz can full-fat coconut milk
1 teaspoon salt
1½ tbsp raw sugar or other sweetener
¼ teaspoon cayenne
Zest of 1 lime
1 teaspoon fresh lime or lemon juice
½ cup loosely packed fresh Thai basil or sweet basil

Instructions:
Combine the lentils with 2½ cups (600ml) of the water in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook the lentils for 13 to 15 minutes**, or until they are al dente, stirring once halfway through the cooking time. Drain the lentils and set aside.
Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, and a pinch salt and cook until the onion is translucent about 4 minutes. Add the ginger and red curry paste and stir to combine. Cook the mixture for 1 to 2 minutes, until the paste is fragrant. Add the veggies, sweet potato and mix well. (If using broccoli, you can add it in with the lentils at step 5, so it doesnt overcook)
Add the milk, remaining ¾ cup (180ml) water, salt, sugar, cayenne, lime zest, and lime juice and stir to combine. Cover and cook for 10 mins or until sweet potatoes are cooked.
Add the cooked lentils and bring the mixture to a rolling boil. Taste and adjust the seasonings. Reduce the heat to low. Add the Thai basil . Cover the saucepan and simmer for a few minutes, until the vegetables are cooked through and the flavors meld. Garnish with the basil and lime wedges.
