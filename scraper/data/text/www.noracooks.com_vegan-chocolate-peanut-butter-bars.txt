Ingredients:
1 cup vegan butter, melted
1 cup creamy peanut butter
1 1/2 cups cookie crumbs ( I used chocolate chip teddy grahams, see NOTES)
2 cups powdered sugar
12 ounces dairy free chocolate chips (1 bag)
1/4 cup creamy peanut butter

Instructions:
Line a 9x13 inch pan with parchment paper, leaving some overhang for easy removal of the bars.
Melt the vegan butter, then add to a large mixing bowl along with the peanut butter and mix well until combined. Now mix in the powdered sugar and stir until combined. Add half of the cookie crumbs and mix until fully combined, then add the other 1/2 and mix to combine. This mixture will be quite thick, so use your hands if needed.
Scoop the peanut butter layer into the prepared pan and press it down evenly to form the bottom layer. Set aside.
