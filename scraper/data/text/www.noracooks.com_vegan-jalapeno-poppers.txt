Ingredients:
12  jalapeno peppers
8 ounces vegan cream cheese (homemade or store-bought*)
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon  garlic powder
1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs
1 tablespoon vegan butter, melted
1/2 cup raspberry jam
2 tablespoons water

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
Put on gloves to deal with the peppers (the spices will get on your hands and you might later burn your eye!). Slice the jalapeños in half lengthwise, then using a small spoon scoop out the membranes and seeds and discard.
In a small bowl, mix the vegan cream cheese, garlic powder and onion powder together until combined.
In another small bowl, mix the melted vegan butter and breadcrumbs.
Scoop the cream cheese mixture into the jalapeños. Sprinkle with the breadcrumbs.
Place on a baking sheet and bake for about 20-25 minutes, until golden brown.
Make the Raspberry Sauce: Add the jam and water to a bowl, and microwave for 30 seconds to 1 minute and stir.
Serve jalapeno poppers with raspberry sauce for dipping. Enjoy!
