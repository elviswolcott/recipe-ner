Ingredients:
1.3 oz dried snow mushrooms ((about 3 cups))
1 - 2  morita chiles, (dried)
1  ancho chiles, (dried)
3  guajillo chiles, (dried)
1  pasilla chile, (dried)
1/2  white onion,
3  plum tomatoes, (large)
2 cloves garlic
1 tbsp. Avocado oil
8 oz King Oyster mushrooms, (sliced and cut into squares)
1 can (30 oz.) white hominy, drained and rinsed
1 sprig fresh epazote or ½ tsp. dried
2  Bay leaves
6 cups vegetable broth
1/2  white onion (minced)
1/4  cup Oregano (dried)
3  Limes
Tostadas or bolillo

Instructions:
Remove the veins and seeds from all of the dried chiles except the morita and place in a heat proof bowl with the snow mushrooms. Pour boiling water over them and let the chiles soak for 10 minutes and the mushrooms for 30 minutes.
Heat a heavy-bottomed skillet or comal  to medium-high heat and place the tomatoes, half an onion and two garlic cloves on it. Let them char on all sides. Be careful with the garlic, because it burns fast. Remove from the pan and set aside. You can also do this by placing the vegetables under the oven broiler set to high.
Drain the soaked chiles, but reserve the water. Place them in the blender with the charred tomatoes onion, and garlic. Add 1 ½ cups of the chile soaking water and blend until smooth. Strain and set aside.
Remove the snow mushrooms from the water, and cut them into bite sized pieces. Set aside.
Heat oil in a large pot set to medium heat. Add the oyster mushrooms and cook until golden brown. Pour in the chile sauce and simmer for 5 minutes.
Pour in the vegetable broth, hominy, snow mushrooms, bay leaf, and epazote. Bring to a simmer over medium-low heat. Simmer for 25- 30 min. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Serve hot topped with minced onion, dry oregano, and limes. In Northern Mexico it is served with bolillo but in the southern states it is served with tostadas.
