Ingredients:
10 ounces pasta of choice
1 medium onion, chopped
1 pound (16 ounces) cremini mushrooms, thinly sliced
4 cloves garlic, minced
3 tablespoons all purpose flour
2 cups vegetable broth
2 teaspoons dijon mustard
salt, to taste
1 cup raw cashews
3/4 cup water
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar

Instructions:
Cook the pasta: In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the pasta noodles according to package instructions. Drain well and set aside.
Make the Cashew Cream: Bring 3 cups of water to a boil. Pour the hot water over the cashews and let soak for 5 minutes. Drain the cashews and discard the soaking water. Add them to a blender along with the 3/4 cup fresh water and apple cider vinegar. Blend until very smooth. Set aside.
In a large pot or pan, add the onions and mushrooms and turn the heat to medium-high. Stir frequently until the mushrooms start to release their moisture, and then cook until the mushrooms are tender and have shrunk in size. You really don&#x27;t need to add any oil here, but you could start with a tablespoon or two of olive oil if you want. The mushrooms release a ton of oil on their own. Season with a little salt + pepper.
Stir in the garlic and cook for 1 more minute, then sprinkle the flour on top and stir it into the vegetables. Gradually pour in the vegetable broth and dijon mustard, stirring. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 4-5 minutes until it thickens slightly.
Now add the cashew cream and stir it in. You should have a very creamy mushroom gravy at this point. Stir in the cooked pasta and cook until heated throughout, about 1-2 minutes. Taste, add salt as needed. Sprinkle with parsley, if desired, and serve immediately.
