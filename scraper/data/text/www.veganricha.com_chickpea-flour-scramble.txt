Ingredients:
1/2 cup chickpea flour (or use 1/2 cup + 1 or 2 Tbsp more besan/gram flour)
1/2 cup water
1 tbsp nutritional yeast
1 tbsp flax seed meal
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp turmeric
1/4 tsp or less paprika
1/8 tsp kala namak (Indian sulphur black salt for the eggy flavor)
generous dash of black pepper
1 tsp oil (divided)
1 clove of garlic
1/4 cup chopped onions
2 tbsp each of asparagus (green bell pepper, zucchini or other veggies.)
1/2  green chile
2 tbsp chopped red bell pepper  (or tomato)
cilantro and black pepper for garnish

Instructions:
Blend all the ingredients under chickpea flour batter and keep aside. You can also use lentil batter from my lentil frittata.
Heat 1/2 tsp oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and cook until translucent. 3 mins.
Add veggies, chile and cook for another 2 mins.
Add in the red bell pepper or tomato and mix in. At this point you can add in some spices or blends or some chopped greens if you like.
Pour the chickpea flour batter over the veggies. Cook for 2 minutes or so until the edges start to set. Drizzle 1/2 tsp oil on the edges. Scramble up the mixture and continue to cook. The mixture will get messy and doughy. Scrape the bottom and let it cook undisturbed for 2 mins or so before scrambling again. Continue to cook until the edges start to dry out. Total 4 to 5 minutes depending on your stove and pan.
Let the doughy mixture sit off heat for 1-2 minutes. Then break into smaller chunks. Sprinkle black pepper very generously. Sprinkle a bit of salt and garnish with cilantro (optional). Serve over multigrain toast or in tacos or burritos.
