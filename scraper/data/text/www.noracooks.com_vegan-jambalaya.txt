Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 package vegan sausage (13 oz), sliced (*I used Field Roast Italian)
1 large yellow onion, chopped
1  green bell pepper, diced
1  red bell pepper, diced
3  stalks celery, chopped
6 cloves garlic, minced
2-3 tablespoons cajun seasoning (,divided)
1 teaspoon salt (omit if your cajun seasoning contains salt)
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, may omit
1 teaspoon dried thyme
14 ounce can crushed tomatoes
2 teaspoons vegan worcestershire sauce
1 1/2 cups long grain white rice, uncooked
2 3/4 cup water
1 cup okra, thinly sliced, optional
fresh chopped parsley and green onion, for serving

Instructions:
In a large pot or pan, add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and warm over medium-high heat. Add the sliced sausages and 1 tablespoon of the cajun seasoning and sauté for 3-4 minutes, until browned and warm. Transfer to a clean plate and set aside.
To the same pot, add the last tablespoon of olive oil and the chopped onion, bell peppers and celery. Sauté for 5-7 minutes, stirring frequently. Now add the garlic, 1 more tablespoon cajun seasoning, salt (omit if your cajun seasoning has salt!), cayenne pepper and thyme. Stir and cook for 1 more minute.
Now add the crushed tomatoes, worcestershire sauce, rice and water to the pot. Stir well, bring to a boil, then lower the heat to a simmer (covered) and cook for 25-30 minutes, until the rice is cooked. Stir every 5 minutes to make sure the rice doesn&#039;t burn and stick to the bottom of the pot. Add a little more water as needed if the mixture starts to dry out.
Stir in the okra, if using. Add the sausage back to the pot and mix well. Taste; season with another tablespoon of cajun seasoning, if desired and add more salt and pepper to taste. Remove from heat.
Serve sprinkled with chopped parsley and green onions, and enjoy!
