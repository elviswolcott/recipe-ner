Ingredients:
1-2 tablespoons olive oil
1  medium yellow onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
3/4 cup molasses
1/2 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup ketchup
3/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
1 1/2 tablespoons vegan Worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons Sriracha hot sauce
(4) 15-ounce cans small navy beans, drained and rinsed

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
In a large pot, warm the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and stir for about 5 minutes, until soft. Then add the garlic and cook for 1 more minute.
To the pot, add the molasses, brown sugar, ketchup, salt, apple cider vinegar, vegan Worcestershire sauce and Sriracha hot sauce. Stir well, then add the drained and rinsed beans.
Transfer to a large casserole dish (I used a 9 x 13 inch dish) and cover with foil. Bake for 1 hour. The sauce should thicken a bit.
Keep warm until ready to serve.
