Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups mashed banana  (| 2 large or 3 small bananas)
1 cup non-dairy milk
1/3 cup canola oil
1 cup granulated sugar
2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
1 tablespoon vanilla
2 1/4 cups all purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup chopped walnuts or chocolate chips (plus more for sprinkling on top)

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a standard muffin pan with liners and spray them lightly with oil.&nbsp;
Mash the bananas in a large mixing bowl. Measure to make sure you have about 1 1/4 cups mashed banana.&nbsp;
Add the non-dairy milk, oil, sugar, vinegar and vanilla to the bowl and whisk with the bananas until well combined.&nbsp;
To the wet mixture, add the flour, then sprinkle the baking powder and salt on top of the flour. Stir to mix with a large spoon until just combined; be careful not to over mix. Some small lumps are fine.
Fold in chopped walnuts or chocolate chips, if using.&nbsp;Using a 1/4 cup measuring cup, add batter to the liners in the pan almost all the way full. Sprinkle more walnuts/chocolate chips on top if desired.
Bake for 20-24 minutes, until golden on top and a toothpick comes out clean. Let cool for 5 minutes in the pan, then transfer to a cooling rack. Enjoy!
