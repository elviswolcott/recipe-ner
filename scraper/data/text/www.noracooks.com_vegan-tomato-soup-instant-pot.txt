Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1  small onion, chopped
3  medium carrots, peeled and chopped
(2) 28-ounce cans diced or crushed tomatoes
3/4 cup vegetable broth
2 teaspoons dried basil OR 1/4 cup fresh chopped basil
1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste
1-2 teaspoons sugar
1/2-1 cup full fat coconut milk, optional

Instructions:
Select the &quot;saute&quot; function on Instant Pot. Add the olive oil and onion and cook for 2-3 minutes, until the onions become translucent.
Turn off the Instant Pot for a moment. Add in the carrots, canned tomatoes, vegetable broth, basil and salt. Lock the lid and close the pressure valve to seal. Cook on high pressure for 5 minutes.
Once it beeps, allow the pressure to naturally release for 10 minutes, then manually release any pressure carefully by turning the pressure valve to &quot;venting&quot;.
Remove the lid from Instant Pot. Using an immersion blender, blend until the soup is very smooth. You may also blend it all in a regular blender if desired.
Taste and adjust, adding more salt if desired, or 1-2 teaspoons sugar to cut down on any acidity.&nbsp;
Now stir in 1/2-1 cup of full fat coconut milk, to add creaminess and richness to the soup. You can leave it out if desired, or use Cashew Cream instead. Serve immediately and enjoy!
