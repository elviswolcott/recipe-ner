Ingredients:
9 oz gemelli pasta
1  avocado
2  cloves of garlic
1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1/2 cup basil
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
1 cup baby spinach
1 tablespoon olive oil
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste
1 cup cherry tomatoes

Instructions:
Cook the pasta according to the instructions on the package. 
In the meantime, combine all of the ingredients for the avocado sauce in a food processor or blender and process until smooth. Set aside. 
Roast the pine nuts in a pan without oil. Be careful not to burn them as they burn rather quickly. 
Cut the cherry tomatoes in halves and either roast them in the oven for a few minutes, cook them in a pan, or serve them fresh with the pasta. 
Combine the cooked pasta with the avocado sauce and carefully stir in the cherry tomatoes. Sprinkle with the roasted pine nuts and fresh basil. Enjoy!
