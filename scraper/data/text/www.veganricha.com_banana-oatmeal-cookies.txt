Ingredients:
1  very ripe banana
2 tbsp maple syrup
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/4 to 1/2 tsp cinnamon
2 to 3 tbsp raw or coconut sugar  (or use stevia or other sweetener)
2 tbsp smooth almond butter ( or peanut butter)
1/4 cup almond flour
1/4 cup coconut flour
1 tbsp cornstarch  (or arrowroot starch)
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
1 cup old fashioned oats (use certified gluten-free if needed)
2 to 3 tbsp vegan chocolate chips

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F / 190c
In a bowl, mash the banana really well. Add the rest of the ingredients and mix until fully combined.
I usually warm the entire bowl by keeping it near the oven (or microwave for a few seconds) to help the nut butter mix in faster.
Add the almond flour, coconut flour, starch, baking soda, baking powder and salt and mix in.
Add oats and chocolate chips and mix in. At this point you can also add cranberries, nuts chopped small, seeds, candied ginger etc.
Oil or flour your hands and make flat cookies from the mixture and place on parchment lined baking sheet.
Bake for 13 to 15 minutes until almost all golden. Cool completely and store in an airtight container on the counter for upto 2 days or refrigerated for upto a week..
