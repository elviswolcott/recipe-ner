Ingredients:
8  dates
1/2 cup hot water
1/8 tsp salt
3/4 cup old fashioned rolled oats (, gluten free if necessary, or use other grain flakes)
2 teaspoon chia seeds
2-3 teaspoons vegan mini chocolate chips
3/4 cup non-dairy milk
2  drops of almond extract or vanilla extract (optional)
2 tbsp toasted shredded coconut (toast over medium low for a few mins)
2 tbsp vegan chocolate chips
2 tsp non-dairy milk
berries, bananas, other fruits

Instructions:
Soak the dates in 1/2 cup hot water for 15 mins if you havent already. Then Blend with the soaking water and salt until smooth and creamy.
Add oats, chia, chocolate chips and non dairy milk to a bowl. Add  3 tbsp date caramel, a pinch of salt. Add almond extract or vanilla extract (optional). I like almond here.
Mix everything and press the oats in so that all oats are soaked. Chill for 10 mins. Transfer to jars. Alternatively, you can mix everything in 1 mason jar.
Top with some date caramel or swirl it in. Then top generously with toasted coconut.
Melt the chocolate chips with the non dairy milk over a double boiler or in microwave. Drizzle over the coconut. You can drizzle the chocolate lightly or pour some in for a thin ganache like layer.
Seal and refrigerate overnight. Warm lightly if needed, before serving. Add berries and sliced fruits of choice and serve.
