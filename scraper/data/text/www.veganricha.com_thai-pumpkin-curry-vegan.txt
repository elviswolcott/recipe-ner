Ingredients:
1 teaspoon oil
1 clove garlic minced
1 tablespoon red curry paste
1/2 teaspoon miso
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1/4 teaspoon dried mushroom powdered
15 ounce can of coconut milk
2 cups  peeled and cubed pumpkin or you can also use kabocha squash,  (acorn, or butternut squash)
2 teaspoons lime juice or 3 or 4 Markut lime leaves
1 cup sliced bell pepper (I used a mix of green and red)
1/4 cup Thai basil and more for garnish
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 cup cubed firm or medium-firm tofu
lime juice , pepper flakes and Thai basil for garnish

Instructions:
Heat the oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook until the garlic is golden.
Then add in your red curry paste, miso, soy sauce, and mushroom powder and mix well. The mix of miso soy sauce and powdered mushroom act as a substitute for fish sauce.
Cook for a minute then add in your coconut milk. Mix the red curry paste in the coconut milk so that there are no lumps remaining.
Then add in the salt, pepper, pumpkin, lime juice, and mix well.
Cover and cook until the pumpkin is al dente. It will take 8-10 minutes depending on the squash used and your stove, etc.
Open the lid and then add in your peppers, Thai basil, sugar, tofu, and mix in. Bring to a good boil.
Taste and adjust salt and flavor. Add more salt if needed. Some lime juice if needed. Then take off heat and serve with some Thai basil on top and more lime juice if needed. Serve with rice or noodles.
