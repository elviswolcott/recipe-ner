Add in more flour if needed to get gooey muffin mixture kind of consistency, Or a very sticky dough. If you added too much flour or oatmeal, add in a little oil and or lemon juice to make is gooey. (If the dough is stiff and not sticky, the cookies might come out too hard)
Oil hands or tablespoon and pick up tablespoon full dough, drop them and flatten on parchment paper. Thinner the better.!
