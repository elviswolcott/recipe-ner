Ingredients:
1 recipe Vegan Alfredo Sauce
6 cups baby spinach
15 ounce can white beans (SEE NOTES)
1 box lasagna noodles
optional: bag of vegan mozzarella shreds
1 cup raw cashews
16 ounces firm tofu
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and lightly grease a 9 by 13 inch casserole dish.
Make the Vegan Alfredo Sauce. Stir the spinach into the sauce and set aside.
Drain and rinse the white beans. Set aside.
Cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions, then drain and rinse and set aside.
Make the Vegan Ricotta: Add the cashews to a food processor and process until fine and crumbly. Then add the tofu in chunks, nutritional yeast, lemon juice, salt, basil, oregano and garlic powder to the food processor. Pulse until well combined and pretty smooth.
Assemble the Lasagna: Spoon 1/4 cup of the alfredo sauce/spinach on the bottom of the casserole dish. Layer with 4-5 lasagna noodles, 1/2 of the vegan ricotta, 1/2 of the beans and about 1/3 of the alfredo sauce/spinach. Add another 4-5 noodles, then the rest of the ricotta, the rest of the beans, 1/3 of the alfredo sauce/spinach, 4-5 more noodles and pour the rest of the alfredo sauce/spinach over the top.
Optional: Top with an entire bag of vegan mozzarella shreds.
Bake uncovered in the oven for 20-25 minutes. Let it cool for 15-20 minutes before serving.
