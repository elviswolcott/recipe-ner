Ingredients:
1/4 cup melted So Delicious Icecream
1/4 cup cooked Quinoa (I used fair trade rainbow quinoa)
3-4 Tablespoons raw sugar or equivalent sweetener (4 Tbsp for sweeter)
1 Tablespoon organic canola oil or virgin coconut oil (I used organic canola)
3/4 cup ground Oats
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
pinch salt

Instructions:
Melt the icecream and combine with sugar/sweetener and oil.
Add cooked and cooled quinoa and mix.
In a bowl mix the Oats, baking powder and salt.
Add this to the wet mixture.
Mix to make a thick muffin batter (not stiff dough) kind of consistency. Add more ground Oats if needed.
Using a large spoon, drop spoonfuls onto baking sheet. The mixture will spread a bit.
Oil hands and shape if needed.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 15-17 minutes or until the center is not jiggly or wet to touch.
Cool on rack. Consume!
