Ingredients:
2  small heads of broccoli (, cut into florets)
2 tsp oil
2  large cloves of garlic (, finely chopped or thin small slices)
1 tsp sesame oil
2 tsp sesame seeds
2 tsp soy sauce (, use tamari for glutenfree, coconut aminos for soyfree)
1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
1 tbsp water
sesame seeds and red pepper flakes for garnish (, while and black sesame seeds)

Instructions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add a generous pinch of salt. Add the broccoli and cook for 3 to 5 mins (depends on the size of the florets and amount of florets to water).
Once the broccoli is bright green, take off heat, drain and wash with cold water.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium low heat. Once the oil is hot, add garlic, reduce heat to low. Mix well and cook until the garlic is golden. 4 to 5 mins. (Slow cooking the garlic will roast it without burning).
Add sesame seeds and sesame oil and continue to cook until the seeds start to change color.
Add soy sauce, red pepper flakes and mix well for a few seconds. Add a tbsp of water and mix and take off heat.
Drizzle over broccoli or add broccoli to the skillet and mix well. Add a dash of salt and pepper to taste. Serve.
