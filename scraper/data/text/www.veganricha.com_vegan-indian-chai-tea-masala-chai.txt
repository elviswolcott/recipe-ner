3/4 cup water
1.5 Tbsp raw sugar or other sweetener to taste
2 tsp chai patti/loose tea
1/4 to 1/2 tsp chai spice/chai masala blend
1/2 to 1 tsp minced/grated fresh ginger (,some fresh gingers are too strong, so use to taste)
1.25 cup Almond breeze plain almond milk or oatmilk or soymilk other non dairy milk.

Instructions:
In a small deep pan at medium heat, add water, sugar, tea leaves, chai masala blend and ginger. Bring to a bubbling boil. 7 to 9 mins
Slowly pour the almond milk. Bring the mix to just about a boil. 6 to 8 minutes.
Strain into a cup and serve hot. Compost the tea leaves.
Note: some plant milks tend to separate when added to the hot water. Add a Tbsp cold/room temperature water to the boiling water to bring the temperature down. Then pour in the plant milk.
