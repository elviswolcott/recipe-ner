Ingredients:
1/2 cup vegan butter, melted
3/4 cup light brown sugar, packed
6 tablespoons unsweetened applesauce
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
1 2/3 cup all purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2-3/4 cup vegan white chocolate chips (or regular chocolate chips)

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a 8 inch square baking pan with parchment paper, leaving overhang on the sides for easy removal.
Melt the butter in a microwave safe mixing bowl for 30 seconds to 1 minute.
In a large bowl, stir the melted vegan butter with the brown sugar until smooth like caramel. Now add the applesauce and vanilla and stir to combine.
Add the flour, baking powder and salt to the wet mixture and stir until just combined. The dough will be a bit thick and sticky.
Fold in the white chocolate chips (or regular chocolate chips). Use your hands if needed to get them evenly dispersed.
Transfer the mixture to the prepared pan and press down evenly with your hands or a spatula. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until the top is set and the blondies are golden.
Let the bars cool for 15 minutes in the pan, them lift them out using the parchment paper and let cool on a cooling rack for another 20 minutes, if you can wait that long! Slice into squares and enjoy!
To store: Keep leftover blondies in a covered container for up to 5 days or freeze for longer.
