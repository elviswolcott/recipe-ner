Ingredients:
1/2 medium banana, frozen if possible
3/4 cup vanilla soy milk
1 tablespoon creamy peanut butter
1 scoop Orgain chocolate protein powder*
8 large ice cubes

Instructions:
Place all ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth and creamy. If it&#39;s not thick or cold enough, add a few more ice cubes and blend again.
Pour into a cup and enjoy. Sometimes I top it with a little vegan whipped cream and mini chocolate chips.
