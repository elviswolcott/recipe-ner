Ingredients:
1/2 cup powdered sugar (ground raw sugar or other fine sugar)
1 tsp granulated sugar
3 Tbsp oil (organic safflower or organic canola)
3 Tbsp blackstrap molasses (reduced this from 3.5 tbsp)
1 Tbsp non dairy milk
1/2 tsp ground ginger
1/3 to 1/2 tsp cinnamon
a generous pinch of salt
1/2  tsp baking soda (scant)
1 cup Spelt flour (for wheat based see the recipe below)

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F / 180Âºc.
In a bowl, mix sugar, oil, molasses, non dairy milk spices and salt. Mix until the sugar is dissolved.
Add the baking soda and mix well.
Add 3/4 cup + 2 tbsp flour and mix in. Add more flour 1 tbsp at a time to make a soft not sticky dough. If the dough seems too dry. Let it sit for 2 minutes and then mix/knead with your hand. The dough gets wetter as it sits as the molasses seeps into the flour. Depending on your molasses and flour, you might need 1 tbsp or so less or more flour. The dough should be soft but not sticky.
Line a large baking sheet with parchment. Take handfuls of the dough and make a smooth flat disc. (2 to 2.5 inch size). Place the disc on the sheet and press the center lightly to even out the thickness if needed. You can coat the discs in sugar. I don't as the cookies are already quite sweet.
Place discs at least 2 inches apart as these cookies will double in size. Put a drop of water in the center of each disc.
Bake for 14 minutes. * The cookies will spread then develop cracks in the last few minutes. They will be soft to touch. Let the cookies cool and set on the sheet for 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the sheet, cool completely and store in an airtight container.
