Ingredients:
2-3 tablespoons olive oil
1/2  yellow onion, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 cups water
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
2 pounds collard greens, cleaned and cut (2 large bunches)
1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar
1/4 cup sun dried tomatoes, chopped, optional
hot sauce, optional

Instructions:
In a large deep pot, saut√© the onion in the olive oil for 5-6 minutes over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook for 1 more minute until fragrant.
To the pot, add the water, smoked paprika, salt and red pepper flakes. Stir and bring to a boil, then reduce heat so it&#039;s simmering gently.
Add in the chopped greens. Cover the pot and simmer for about an hour. They shouldn&#039;t be boiling too hard, just gently simmering on low heat. Give the greens a stir every now and then.
About halfway through cooking, add the vinegar and sun dried tomatoes, if using.
After an hour, taste and add more salt, hot sauce or any other seasonings as desired. Enjoy!
