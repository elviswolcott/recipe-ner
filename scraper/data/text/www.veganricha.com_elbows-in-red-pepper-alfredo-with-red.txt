Ingredients:
1/2  medium red pepper chopped ((can be substituted with roasted red peppers))
1/2 cup cashews soaked for an hour ((can be substituted by silken tofu))
4 cloves garlic
1/2 teaspoon onion powder ((or a tablespoon of red onions cooked to golden))
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon cajun spice ((optional, I like cajun spice and roasted red pepper together))
1/2 teaspoon sea salt or to taste
1  dried red chili
olive oil as required
nutrtional yeast ((optional))
2 cups Elbows or any pasta ((cooked as per instructions on the package))
5-7  asparagus sliced
1/2  medium red onion

Instructions:
In a pan, add a teaspoon of olive oil, garlic and dried red chili.
Cook for 2 minutes on medium heat.
Add in the chopped red pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, till the peppers start to brown (5-7 minutes).
In a blender, add the cooked peppers, garlic, chili. Add in the soaked cashews, onion powder(or a tablespoon of cooked onions), garlic powder, cajun spice, salt to taste and 2 teaspoons olive oil. You can use roasted red peppers instead of cooked red peppers, and silken tofu instead of soaked cashews as well.
Blend well, use a little water if needed and blend into a creamy mixure.
In a large pan, add a teaspoon of canola oil, and add in the chopped red onion and sliced asparagus or any other veggies you want to add.
Cook on medium low heat for 7-8 minutes, stirring occasionally till both are cooked well and start to brown.
Add in the red pepper alfredo and cooked elbows or any other pasta.
Toss well to coat. Adjust salt and spice and cook on low heat for 4-5 minutes or until the alfredo gets hot enough to bubble and the required consistency.
Serve hot topped with nutritional yeast or daiya vegan cheese or fresh parsley!.
