Ingredients:
6 to 8 oz vegan soba noodles  (or Brown rice Pad thai noodles or other similar noodles or pasta)
3 tbsp soy sauce (use certified gf if needed)
1 to 2 tsp sesame oil
1 tsp sugar
1 tbsp minced ginger
4 cloves of garlic (finely chopped)
1/2  small onion (thinly sliced)
1  green chile (thinly sliced)
2 to 3 cups of veggies  (like sliced bell pepper, mushrooms, broccoli, snow peas, julienned carrots, chopped spinach or chard etc.)
salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes to taste

Instructions:
Cook the noodles according to instructions. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add the noodles and cook for the time mentioned on the package.
In a bowl combine the soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar and ginger. Mix well and set aside.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onions, garlic, chile, bell peppers and mushrooms and cook for 4 minutes. Stir occasionally.
Add the broccoli and other veggies if using and a dash of salt and black pepper and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes or until mushrooms are golden brown.
Add the sauce, cooked noodles to the skillet and mix in. Adjust heat if needed. I usually add a sprinkle of pepper flakes or sriracha and a good dash of freshly ground black pepper. Serve.
