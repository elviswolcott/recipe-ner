Ingredients:
1 cup warm water
1 Tbsp active dry yeast
1 Tbsp coconut sugar (or other sugar)
3 cups unbleached white flour (or all purpose flour + more for dusting)
1/2-3/4 tsp salt
3 Tbsp oil (or melted vegan butter)
2 tsp coarse sea salt (or kosher salt, for sprinkling)
1 tbsp baking soda
1/2 cup boiling water
1 tbsp cornstarch
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup raw cashews (soaked overnight)
1/4 cup almond milk (plus more, if needed)
1-2 Tbsp Dijon mustard
2-4 tsp hot sauce
1 Tbsp nutritional yeast
salt and pepper, if needed

Instructions:
In a bowl, combine the warm water, yeast, and sugar. Mix and let sit until frothy, 5 minutes.
In another bowl, combine flour and 3/4 tsp salt. Mix well. Add the flour mixture, oil, and yeast mixture to a stand mixture fitted with the hook attachment and knead into a soft, smooth dough. Or, add the yeast mixture to the flour, add the oil, and knead by hand for 4-6 minutes to make a smooth dough.
Spray water on the dough, cover with a towel, and let it rise for 1 hour, or until doubled.
Flatten the dough into a 1/2 inch thick rectangle. Cut up strips using a pizza cutter. (thinner, about 1/2 inch thick, for smaller pretzels). Roll the strips between your hands if they are uneven. Cut the strips into 1 inch bites. Place the bites on parchment lined baking sheet, at least 1/2 inch away from each other.
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F / 220ÂºC. Make the baking soda wash: Add baking soda to boiling 1/2 cup of water, mix, and set aside.
Brush the pretzels liberally with warm baking soda wash. Let them sit for 2 minutes. Then slice the tops using knife or kitchen scissors (optional). Meanwhile, make the cornstarch wash: Mix the cornstarch in 1/2 cup of water and heat the water over medium heat until it thickens into a sludge. Brush the pretzels with the warm cornstarch wash. Sprinkle granulated salt on the pretzels.
Bake for 13 to 14 minutes, or until a nice golden brown color. Serve with the Spicy Mustard Dip
