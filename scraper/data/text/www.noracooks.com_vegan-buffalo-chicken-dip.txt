Ingredients:
2 cups raw cashews
1 cup water
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons onion powder
1 cup buffalo sauce
(1) 14-ounce can artichoke hearts, drained (| in water, NOT marinated in oil)
celery sticks, carrot sticks
tortilla chips
crackers or sliced baguette
chopped green onions

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
Soak the cashews: Heat up about 3 cups of water in a tea kettle or small pot. Pour the boiling hot water over the cashews and let them soak for 5 minutes. Drain them when ready to blend.
In a high powered blender such as a Vitamix, add the soaked, drained cashews, 1 cup of fresh water, lemon juice, salt, garlic powder and onion powder. Blend until very smooth.
Now add the buffalo sauce and artichokes. Pulse a couple of times, but do not blend. You want to leave quite a bit of chunky texture!
Transfer to an oven safe dish (1 1/2-2 quarts, a pie pan works as well), and bake for 25-30 minutes. 
Serve warm with celery sticks, carrot sticks, tortilla chips, crackers or a sliced baguette. Chopped green onions on top look pretty and taste good, too. Enjoy!
