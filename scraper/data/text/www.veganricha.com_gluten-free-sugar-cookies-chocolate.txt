Ingredients:
1/4 cup brown rice flour
1/4 cup white rice flour
1/4 cup cornstarch (or use other starch like arrowroot)
1/4 cup coconut flour (or use cashew flour or oat flour)
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/2 cup ground raw sugar or any other finely ground sweetener
1/4 cup oil (I used organic canola)
3 Tbsp almond milk or other non-dairy milk
1 Tbsp flax meal
1/2 tsp vanilla extract

Instructions:
In a bowl, add all the dry ingredients and mix well. In another bowl, mix the flax meal with non-dairy milk and let sit for 2 minutes. Add in the vanilla and oil and whisk to combine. Add to dry and mix. Knead well for 2-4 minutes to form a smooth dough. Spray water on the dough if it does not come together easily(not more than 2-4 sprays).
Pat the dough down and use cookie cutters to cut desired shapes. I only have rounds :). I used 1 inch round cutter as it looked cute, and got about 34 cookies. Gather remaining dough, pat down and cut more cookies or shape into balls and flatten. Place the cookies on a parchment-lined baking sheet, cover with another parchment and refrigerate for 15-30 minutes(or 10 minutes in the freezer).
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Bake for 13-14 minutes(a few minutes longer for larger cookies) until the edges just about start to get golden. Move the cookies around from outside to inside at the 11-minute mark and bake for 2-5 minutes more depending on the cookie size. Let cool completely. Serve as is or dip in melted chocolate or top with favorite frosting.
