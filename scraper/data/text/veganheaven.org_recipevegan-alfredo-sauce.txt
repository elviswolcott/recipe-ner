Ingredients:
2 heaped cups cauliflower
1/2 cup cashews ((unsalted and not roasted))
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
1/4 cup nutritional yeast
2  cloves of garlic
2 1/2 cups unsweetened soy or almond milk
1/2 cup unsweetened soy or almond milk ((add after cooking))
1 pinch nutmeg
salt
pepper
freshly chopped parsley
cooked fettuccine

Instructions:
Cut the cauliflower into florets. Place them in a sauce pan together with the cashews, the garlic, and the almond milk.&nbsp;Add the nutritional yeast. Stir everything with a wooden spoon until well combined.
Cover with a lid and cook for 20 minutes. There won't be much liquid left. Transfer everything into a high speed blender. Add the lemon juice, a pinch of nutmeg, apple cider vinegar, and 1/2 cup more unsweetened almond or soy milk as well as salt and pepper.
Process until smooth. This should take about 30-60 seconds.
Cook the fettuccine according to the instructions on the package. Set aside.
Pour the blended sauce into a pan and cook for a minute.&nbsp;Then add the cooked fettuccine and stir until well combined. Season with salt and pepper again if you want.
Serve immediately and sprinkle with freshly chopped parsley. Enjoy!
