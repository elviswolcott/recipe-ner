Ingredients:
5 tablespoons aquafaba*see instructions
1/2 cup pure maple syrup
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups raw walnuts
2 cups raw cashews
1 cup pepitas
1 cup shredded coconut, unsweetened
1 cup dried cranberries or blueberries, optional

Instructions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
Drain the liquid from a can of chickpeas (garbanzo beans), and measure out 5 tablespoons (this is aquafaba). Add this to a large mixing bowl and whisk for 1-2 minutes, until it's white and foamy (see photos in collage above).
Now add the maple syrup, vanilla, cinnamon and salt to the aquafaba and whisk until well combined. Set aside to prepare the nuts/seeds.
Add the walnuts, cashews, pepitas and coconut to a food processor. Pulse until crumbly. Don't overdo it or the nuts will start to release their oils and we don't want that. It won't take long at all.&nbsp;
Add the nut/coconut mixture to the bowl and mix well with a wooden spoon.&nbsp;
Spread the granola evenly on the prepared baking sheet, pressing it down a bit with your hands.&nbsp;
Bake for 20 minutes, then take it out and give it a little stir. Bake another 20-25 minutes until slightly golden brown on top. Remove from oven.
Let it cool for at least 20 minutes before removing from the sheet. Do NOT stir it right when you take it out, it needs to cool and harden; that's how you get amazing clumps of granola!
Once cooled, break the granola apart to make clumps of granola and add any dried fruit if using. Make the clumps as small or large as you prefer. Store in an airtight container or ziplock bag in the fridge. It will keep for at least a week in the fridge, if it lasts that long!
