Ingredients:
1  medium beet
1  medium potato
1 teaspoon garlic paste
1 teaspoon ginger paste
1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon coriander powder
1/2 cup bread crumbs
1 Tablespoon gram flour (besan)

Instructions:
Peel the beet and potato and chop them up.
Pressure cook them with little water(1/2 cup). Or cook the until they soften in a covered pan.
Drain the water.
Mash the beet and potato nicely.
Add salt,pepper. coriander powder, ginger garlic paste and mix well.
The mixture might be a bit squishy, so add half the bread crumbs. you can also use coarsely blended quick cooking oats, to get a less sticky mix.
In a shallow bowl, mix 2-3 Tablespoons of water with the gram flour and make thin paste.
Make flat balls of the beet potato mixture. Dip each ball in the gram flour paste to coat well on all sides and dip the flat ball in the bread crumbs.
Shallow fry the cutlets/burgers 5 minutes on each side.
Serve hot with cilantro chutney or between bread slices with favorite dressing!
