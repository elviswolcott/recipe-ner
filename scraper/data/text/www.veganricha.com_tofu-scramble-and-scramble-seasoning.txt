Ingredients:
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
1 tablespoon Kala namak, which is Indian sulphur black salt
1 teaspoon turmeric
3/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon oil
1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper
1/4 cup chopped green onion (keep the green parts of the onion for garnish)
1/4-1/2 cup  veggies of choice
15 ounce pack of firm tofu divided
1/4 - 1/2  cup   water (or use unsweetened non dairy milk for creamier)
1 1/2 tablespoons  scramble seasoning plus more for garnish
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
green onion or cilantro for garnish

Instructions:
Scramble seasoning: To make the scramble seasoning, mix everything in a bowl and set aside or store in a sealed glass bottle for up to 2 months.
To make the tofu scramble, heat a skillet over medium heat. Add oil then add the vegetables and cook until they are golden on some edges.
Slice the tofu block and take about a quarter of the tofu block. Add to a blender. Add the seasoning and a 1/4 cup of water and blend until smooth.
You might need more water. Add 1-2 tablespoons at a time and blend until it&#39;s super creamy. You can also use 3 oz silken tofu instead of the firm tofu for the eggy mix
Then add this creamy mixture to the skillet then mix well.
When it's just about to boil, add the crumbled up rest of the block of the tofu and mix well.
Cook until the mixture is homogenous and the tofu is evenly colored with yellow. Taste and adjust salt and flavor. Take off heat
To serve, sprinkle a little bit of the salt, black pepper, green onions, and some more of the scramble seasoning all over the scramble and then serve.
