Ingredients:
1 cup Macadamia nuts (raw)
1 clove Garlic (peeled)
1 tsp. Lime juice (fresh)
2 tbsp. Olive or vegetable oil
2 tsp.  Nutritional yeast
½ tsp. Salt
1 piece cheesecloth
1  Tomato (large)
1/4  Onion, white
1 clove Garlic (unpeeled)
¼ cup Chopped pineapple
1  Chile chipotle adobo (1 pepper)
1 tbsp. Cilantro (chopped)

Instructions:
For the queso fresco: soak the macadamias in water at room temperature overnight. The following day, drain the nuts and place in a food processor with the garlic, lime juice, oil, nutritional yeast, and salt.
Process 1-2 minutes or until the nuts turn into a paste that resembles ricotta cheese. If necessary you can add 1 tbsp. of water to reach the ricotta consistency. Taste and adjust seasoning.
Wet a large piece of cheesecloth, approximately 12” X 12”. Place the paste in the center and a form it into a ball by gathering the edges of the cheesecloth around the cheese.
Twist the top edges of the cheesecloth to tighten, give shape, and get rid of excess water in the cheese. Place the cheese bundle on a plate and let sit overnight in the refrigerator.
The next day unwrap your cheese and serve.
To make the salsa: boil water in a small saucepot. Drop tomato in and lower heat to a simmer. Simmer for 3-4 minutes or until the tomato begins to soften.
While the tomato is simmering, set a large sauté pan to medium-high heat. Place the onion and garlic in the pan and let the high heat char them for 2 minutes on each side. Remove from pan, peel the garlic, and place them both in the blender.
Remove the tomato from the water and add to the blender. Add the chipotle, cilantro, and pineapple to the blender and process until you reach the desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper.
