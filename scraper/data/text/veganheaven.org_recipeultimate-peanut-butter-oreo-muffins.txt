Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup cocoa powder
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 cup almond milk or other plant-based milk
1 tablespoon canola oil
2 tablespoons unsweetened apple sauce
24  oreo cookies
1/2 - 3/4  cup chunky peanut butter
1/4 cup peanuts, roughly chopped

Instructions:
First make the vegan chocolate muffin batter. In a bowl, combine all ingredients and stir with a wooden spoon until well combined.
Line a muffin tray with paper liners.
Then make the Oreo peanut butter stacks that go inside of the muffins. You need two Oreo cookies for each muffin. Put some peanut butter on the first Oreo, put the second on top, and again spread some peanut butter on top of it.  Put one stack in each paper liner.
Evenly add the muffin batter on top of each stack (about 2-3 tablespoons for each muffin). 
Make sure it runs down the side of the Oreo stacks. Sprinkle with the chopped peanuts.
Preheat the oven to 350 Â°F and bake for 18 minutes. Enjoy!
