Ingredients:
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup unsweetened natural peanut butter
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 1/2 teaspoons rice wine vinegar
1 tablespoon maple syrup
juice of 1/2 lime
1/4 cup + 1 tablespoon canned coconut milk
1 teaspoon red curry paste
1 teaspoon roasted sesame oil
5  green onions
2  cloves of garlic
1 1 inch piece  fresh ginger
1 small zucchini ((about 5 oz))
1 1/2 cups broccoli florets
2  carrots
1  red bell pepper
9 oz rice noodles

Instructions:
Cook the rice noodles according to the instructions on the package. Set aside. Place all ingredients in a blender. 
Process until smooth. / (If you&#039;re using a Thermomix like I did choose: 3 min/ speed 3/70C).
Transfer to a small bowl and set aside for later. 
Finely chop the garlic and the ginger and cut the green onions into rings. Then heat the sesame oil in a large pan and cook it for 3 minutes on high heat. Stir constantly. / (If you&#039;re using a Thermomix choose: 5 sec/speed 8 and then 3 min/120 C/wooden spoon (soft stir) without measuring lid).  
Cut the red bell pepper into thin strips, the broccoli into small florets, the zucchini into half moons, and the carrots into thin slices. 
Add the vegetables and 2/3 of the peanut sauce to the green onion, ginger, and garlic mixture in the pan. Cook for 5 minutes on high heat. Stir constantly. / (If you&#039;re using a Thermomix choose: 5 min/120 C/ speed 1).
Place into a large bowl and add the cooked rice noodles and the remaining peanut sauce. Toss until well combined. If you want you could add some green onion rings and red pepper flakes on top.
