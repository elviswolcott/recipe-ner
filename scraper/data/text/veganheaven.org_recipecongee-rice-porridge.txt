Ingredients:
1/2 tablespoon sesame oil
1 cup white long-grain rice
2  cloves of garlic, minced
8-10 cups vegetable broth
6 oz tempeh, cut into cubes
1 teaspoon paprika powder
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/2 cup cooked edamame
3  green onions, cut into rings
2 small heads pak choi, cut into slices
1 tablespoon white sesame seeds
1 tablespoon black sesame seeds
1 cup bamboo shoots
soy sauce
sriracha sauce

Instructions:
Heat the sesame oil in a medium pot and cook the rice and the garlic for 1-2 minutes. Then add the vegetable broth, bring to boil and turn down the heat to a simmer. Partially cover and continue to simmer for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Stir occasionally with a wooden spoon. Towards the end stir more often to make it creamier. Add more vegetable broth or water if needed.
In the meantime, make the tempeh. Heat some more sesame oil in a pan, add the tempeh, the soy sauce, and the paprika powder and cook for 4 minutes or until crispy. Season with salt and pepper.
Then make the pak choi. Heat 1/2 a tablespoon of water in a medium pan with a lid and steam the pak choi for about 3 minutes. Season with a splash of soy sauce.
Serve the congee (warm) with the toppings and top it off with a little bit of soy sauce and sriracha.
