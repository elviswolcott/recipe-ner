Ingredients:
1/4 cup oil (organic safflower or canola)
1/4 cup maple syrup
1/4 cup smooth sunbutter or use almond butter (peanut butter or cashew butter)
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 tsp lemon juice
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 tsp cinnamon (optional)
1/2 cup oats
3/4 cup (scant) cup flour (I use Spelt. Oat flour will work as well)
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/3 cup vegan chocolate chips

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a bowl, mix the first 7 ingredients until smooth. It will take a minute.
Add oats, 1/2 cup flour and baking soda and mix well. Add flour 1 tbsp at a time to make a loose sticky mixture.
Fold in the chocolate chips. Use a scoop to place on parchment lined baking sheet.
Bake for 10 to 11 minutes. Cookie slam the sheet once or twice so the cookies settle. Let cool completely. The cookies will be soft just baked, but will harden and set as they cool. Store on the counter for the day and covered for upto 4 days.
