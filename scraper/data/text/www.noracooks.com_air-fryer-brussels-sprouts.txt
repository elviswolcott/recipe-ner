Ingredients:
1 pound (16 ounces) brussels sprouts
2 tablespoons olive oil
salt + pepper
1/2 cup Vegan Mayo
1 tablespoon Sriracha hot sauce
1 tablespoons pure maple syrup or agave

Instructions:
Trim and halve the brussels sprouts. Don&#x27;t throw away the leaves that fall off when you trim the sprouts, they are delicious cooked!
Place them in a bowl, then add the olive oil and stir to coat. Add the brussel sprouts to the air fryer basket.
Set the heat to 400 degrees and cook for about 15 minutes, shaking them after 10 minutes every so often and checking for doneness. The time required will depend on how large or small your sprouts are. They are ready when crispy and blackened in some spots, and tender on the inside.
Sprinkle with salt + pepper to taste and remove carefully as air fryer will be hot. Tongs come in handy here!
Make Sriracha Aioli, if using: Whisk vegan mayo (either homemade or store bought), Sriracha and maple syrup/agave in a small bowl until combined.
Serve brussels sprouts hot with optional aioli for dipping. Enjoy!
