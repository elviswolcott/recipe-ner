Ingredients:
8 ounces vegan chocolate chips or chopped vegan chocolate bars (about 1 cup)
1 cup full fat coconut milk or cream

Instructions:
Add chocolate chips to a medium sized bowl. If using chocolate bars, chop and place in the bowl.
Scoop the thick white part from the can of coconut if it&#039;s naturally separated. Try to use mostly the thick white coconut cream, but some of the clearer liquid is fine. A can of coconut cream works best.
Put the coconut milk in a microwave safe bowl or measuring cup and heat in the microwave for about 1 minute, watching to make sure it doesnâ€™t bubble over.
Pour the warm cream over the chocolate chips and let sit for 2-3 minutes. Don&#039;t stir yet.
After 2-3 minutes, whisk the chocolate/melted coconut milk until smooth. To use as a frosting let it cool completely first, it will thicken up and become spreadable. To make it runnier, you can warm it in the microwave for 30 seconds to 1 minute before using, such as for pancakes, cupcakes, or as a drizzle on a cake.
