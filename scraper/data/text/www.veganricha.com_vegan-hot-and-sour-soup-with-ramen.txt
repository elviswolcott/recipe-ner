Ingredients:
5 1/2 cups vegetable broth (or mushroom broth)
1/2 inch ginger
2 cloves garlic
1  hot green chili
3 tbsp soy sauce
1 tbsp dark soy sauce (Or use 1 tbsp regular soy sauce, and 1 tsp molasses)
1 tbsp vinegar (such as rice vinegar, or white  vinegar)
1/4 tsp salt
1/8 tsp black pepper
a good dash of white pepper
1 tsp sugar (or maple syrup)
1/2 cup thinly sliced carrots
1 cup chopped mushrooms
1 cup thinly shredded cabbage
1/2-1 cup chopped firm tofu (chopped small )
1 tbsp cornstarch
3  or 4 green onions (chopped, keep most of the green parts for garnishing, and use the white and half of the green parts for the soup)
3 oz   ramen noodles

Instructions:
Add 5 cups of broth to a saucepan over medium heat.
Mince your ginger, garlic, and chili together so that they get crushed together. Add that to the broth.
Add all the sauces, and seasonings, the soy sauce, dark soy sauce, vinegar, salt, peppers, and sugar to the broth.
Once the mixture is starting to boil, add in your mushroom, carrots, tofu, and stir.
Once the mixture is rapidly boiling, add in the cabbage.
Mix in the cabbage, then carefully taste and adjust the flavor with the extra soy sauce, and vinegar if needed.
Add in the white parts of green onions.
While the soup is boiling, make your cornstarch slurry with 1 tbsp of cornstarch mixed in 1/2 cup of the remaining broth.
Toss in the ramen noodles , and once they have broken apart, and they seem like they're about to just be al dente, add in your cornstarch mixture, and mix well. Let the mixture start to boil again, and then take off heat. You don't want to cook the ramen noodles too much. You want them to be just about done, because they'll continue to cook in the hot broth.
Take the pot off the heat, taste and adjust salt and flavor with soy sauce,salt, vinegar etc.  garnish with some pepper flakes or black pepper , and the remaining parts of the green onion, and serve immediately.
