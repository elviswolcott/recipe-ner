Ingredients:
1 cup fresh basil
1 cup fresh parsley
1/4 cup pine nuts
1/4 cup walnuts
3 tablespoons olive oil ((extra virgin))
2  cloves of garlic
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper

Place all of the ingredients in a blender of food processor.
Process until rather smooth with a few chunks. It's best to use the pulse function. However, make sure not to process the pesto for too long because otherwise it might become bitter.
