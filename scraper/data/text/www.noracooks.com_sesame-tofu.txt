Ingredients:
2 (16 ounce) blocks firm or extra-firm tofu
2 teaspoons sesame oil
2 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce (*use tamari for gluten free)
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1/2 cup low sodium soy sauce (or tamari)
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup agave, maple syrup or brown sugar
1/4 cup seasoned rice vinegar
1-2 teaspoons Sriracha hot sauce, more or less to taste
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1/4 cup water
1 tablespoon sesame oil
4 cups cooked rice
chopped green onions
sesame seeds
steamed broccoli

Instructions:
Press the tofu: Wrap each block of tofu in paper towels. Place a plate or pan on top of the wrapped tofu, and put a couple of heavy books on top of that. Let the tofu press for 20 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and lightly grease a large baking sheet with oil or line with parchment paper.
Slice the pressed tofu into cubes, then add them to a large ziplock bag (or large bowl), along with the sesame oil, soy sauce and cornstarch. Close the bag, and shake gently to coat. Arrange the tofu evenly on the prepared pan, and bake for 25 minutes, or until golden and crispy.
While the tofu bakes, cook your rice and make the sauce. In a large pan, add the soy sauce, garlic, agave, seasoned rice vinegar and Sriracha hot sauce. Stir and bring to a simmer over medium heat. In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch and water together until smooth, then pour into the pan. Stir constantly until the sauce thickens, then turn off the heat. Stir in the sesame oil.
When the tofu is done baking, add it to the sauce and stir to coat the pieces. Serve with rice, sesame seeds, chopped green onions and some steamed broccoli. Enjoy!
