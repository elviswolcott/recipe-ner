Ingredients:
5 to 6  potatoes cubed into large pieces (yukon gold or baking potatoes, peeled if desrired)
5 cloves of garlic
1/2 tsp salt
1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil ( or vegan butter)
a good dash of black pepper
dash of parlsey or thyme
pinch of nutmeg
1 cup full fat coconut milk
fresh chives for garnish

Instructions:
Pressure cook the cubed potatoes, garlic cloves, 1/4 tsp salt with 1.5 cups water  at high pressure for 4 minutes in Instant pot (manual 4 mins) or 2 minutes in stove top pressure cooker. Release the pressure after 5 minutes. (You can also boil them in a saucepan. Put the potatoes into a large pot, adding enough water to cover them. Bring to a boil and simmer for 10-15 mins, until theyâ€™re fork-tender. Transfer to a colander to drain. )
Drain really well. Transfer to a bowl, let sit for a few minutes to dry out. Mash lightly and let sit for a minute for the steam to escape.&nbsp;
Make sure to mash the cooked garlic. Mix in salt, the rest of the ingredients and half cup coconut milk. Mix and whip lightly, just enough to add air and still have some texture. Let sit for a minute for the milks to incorporate and absorb.
Taste and adjust. Add 1/4 tsp or more salt as needed. Add more coconut milk for creamier consistency to preference if needed and mix in. Add 1-2 tbsp nutritional yeast for cheesy potatoes. Garnish with chives. Serve warm as side with 1 pot&nbsp; Gravy.&nbsp;or use to make shepherd's pie
