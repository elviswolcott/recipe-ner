Cook your noodles according to the instructions in the package. While the noodles are cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add oil. Add in the onion, carrots, and mushrooms, white parts of the green onion and 1/4 teaspoon salt and mix well
Cook until the mushrooms are starting to cook to preference. Add in the garlic half way through and continue to cook. Stir occasionally.
Meanwhile, measure out the ingredients of the sauce and add everything to the skillet except corn starch mixture and mix well.
Bring the sauce to a boil then add in corn starch mixed in water and let the sauce come to a boil. Then add in your cooked noodles and toss well to coat then take off heat. Taste and adjust salt and flavor to preference then serve and garnish with the green onions.
If you don&#39;t have gochujang, you can also use gochugaru dried flakes along with an Asian chili garlic sauce , or you can just use Sambal oelek chili garlic sauce instead of the gochujang
