Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all purpose flour
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
3/4 cup canola oil (*or melted coconut oil)
1 1/2 cups unsweetened soy milk
2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
1/2 cup rainbow sprinkles
1 Recipe Vegan Vanilla Frosting
more sprinkles, for topping (1/4 cup)

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and spray two 8 or 9 inch cake pans with oil. I also like to place a circle of round parchment paper in the bottom to prevent the cakes from sticking to the pans.
In a large mixing bowl, whisk the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, salt and sugar together until well combined.
To the same bowl, pour in the oil, soy milk, apple cider vinegar and vanilla. Mix with the dry ingredients using a large spoon until just combined. Be careful not to over mix, or the cake won&#039;t be as soft. Fold in 1/2 cup sprinkles.
Divide the batter evenly between the cake pans and bake for 30-35 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean.
Let the cakes cool in the pans for about 10 minutes, then carefully pop them out and place on a cooling rack. You must allow the cakes to cool completely before frosting.
Prepare a batch of Vegan Vanilla Frosting. Once the cakes have cooled, frost as desired and top with more sprinkles. Serve and enjoy!
