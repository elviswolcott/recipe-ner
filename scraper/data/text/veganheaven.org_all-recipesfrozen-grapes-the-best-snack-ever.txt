Ingredients:
3 cups red or white grapes  (or as many as you want! )

Instructions:
Put the grapes in a colander and rinse them with cold water for about 30 seconds. Gently rub them as you rinse them. Grapes belong to the "dirty dozen" (products that have the highest concentration of pesticides), so this helps to remove bacteria and pesticides on the grapes.
Check for any broken or decaying grapes and remove them.&nbsp;Gently pull the rest of the grapes from the stem.
Fill the washed and pulled grapes in a ziploc bag.
Freeze the grapes overnight or for at least 8 hours.
