Ingredients:
1  pizza dough (homemade or store-bought)
1 cup pizza sauce
1 teaspoon cumin
2 teaspoons paprika powder
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste
1 cup veggie ground meat
1 cup  canned kidney beans
1 cup corn (frozen or canned)
1/2  red bell pepper, sliced
1/2  green bell pepper, sliced
1/2  red onion, sliced
1/2 cup vegan cheese
1  green chili, sliced
1/2 cup vegan sour cream
red pepper flakes, to taste
1/2 cup fresh cilantro

Instructions:
Make your pizza dough. You could use my recipe for a vegan pizza dough. Or use a store-bought one. Preheat the oven to 350 °F. 
Roll out your pizza dough and place it on a baking tray lined with parchment paper. In a small bowl, combine the pizza sauce with the spices. Spoon the pizza sauce on top and evenly spread it out. 
Now add the toppings. Start by adding the veggie ground meat, then the corn, the bell peppers, the red onion, and the kidney beans. 
Top the pizza with vegan cheese. 
Bake the pizza for 7-10 minutes at 350 °F. Keep the pizza in the middle of the oven, so the crust won&#x27;t burn.
Top the pizza with vegan sour cream and sprinkle it with red pepper flakes, sliced green chili, and fresh cilantro. Serve immediately.
