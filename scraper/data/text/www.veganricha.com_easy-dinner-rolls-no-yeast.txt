Ingredients:
1.5 cups unbleached white flour  (or ap flour)
2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/3 tsp salt (use less if the aquafaba is very salted)
dried or fresh herbs of choice (optional. I added some rosemary and thyme)
1/3 cup aquafaba (chickpea water, water from a can of chickpeas or use 1/3 cup non dairy milk + 1 Tbsp flax/chia seed meal)
2 Tbsp non dairy yogurt  (or cashew or melted vegan butter)
1.5 tbsp oil
1 tsp apple cider vinegar
3 to 4 tbsp water

Instructions:
In a bowl whisk all the dry ingredients really well.
In another bowl mix the aquafaba, yogurt, oil, vinegar and 2 tbsp water.
Add half the flour into the wet and mix in until well combined. Add the rest of the flour and mix.
Get your hands in to knead the mixture. Add water 1 tbsp at a time to knead into a soft dough. The dough will get stickier as you knead, which is ok. Stop when the dough is soft and starting to get quite sticky. Let the dough sit for 5 minutes.
Add a tsp of oil on the dough and spread all over. Divide the dough into 7 to 9 pieces. Roll into as smooth as possible balls and place in parchment lined cake pan, close to each other but not touching.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F / 200Âºc.
Spray water on the shaped dinner rolls. Cover with another parchment to seal the top as much as possible. Let it sit for 4 to 5 minutes while the oven heats up.
Bake for 13 minutes. Remove the top parchment. Brush with vegan butter or maple syrup, and bake for another 2 minutes. Broil for 1/2 to 1 minute to brown if needed. Do not over brown else the rolls will become too biscuit like.
Remove the pan from the oven. Brush vegan butter on the rolls. Let them rest for a minute before serving. The the top will feel crusty but will soften a bit as it sits.
Store over the counter covered for the day. These are best served warm out of the oven. Open them up and serve with vegan butter.
