1 teaspoon blackstrap molasses
2 teaspoons Oil
4 oz Tempeh (thinly sliced or chopped small)

3-4  bundles of Buckwheat Soba (cook according to instructions. (Or use other noodles, rice or quinoa))
2 teaspoon of Sriracha.

Instructions:
Cook the Soba or other noodles according to instructions.(Cook in boiling water for 6-7 minutes). Drain, rinse in cold water, add Sriracha and toss/mix and keep ready.
Teriyaki Tempeh and Mushrooms:
In 2 teaspoons oil, cook the Tempeh over medium heat for 2 minutes.
Add mushrooms and continue to saute until tempeh is golden on the edges. 2-3 minutes.
Blend all the ingredients of the Teriyaki sauce and add to the tempeh.
Cover and cook over low-medium heat until most of the sauce is absorbed by the Tempeh and the sauce gets bubbly and starts to caramelize.
Transfer the Tempeh and mushrooms to the noodle bowl.
Add a Tablespoon of water to the pan, mix and drizzle the remaining sticky sauce on the noodles.
Top with mung bean sprouts, carrot slivers, cucumber slices etc. Serve hot.
