Ingredients:
2 cups pecans
3 tbsp coconut sugar (, 4 tbsp for sweeter)
1 tsp gingerbread spice or pumpkin pie spice or cinnamon
1/4 tsp salt
2 tbsp maple syrup

Instructions:
Heat a skillet over low-medium heat. Add the pecans and toast until they start to change color slightly. Let them sit for the first 2 mins then stir every half a minute. 6 to 9 mins.
Add the rest of the ingredients and mix well. Stir continuously. The mixture will thin out then thicken and start to stiffen. Take off heat.
Transfer to a plate or parchment lined baking sheet and separate the clumps if needed. Cool completely and store in an airtight container for upto 2 weeks. Or gift in jars.
