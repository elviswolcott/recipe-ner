Ingredients:
8 oz firm Tofu pressed for atleast 10 mins to remove excess moisture, then sliced thin
2 tbsp soy sauce or use tamari for glutenfree
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp ginger powder
4 oz brown rice pad thai noodles (or 6 oz vermicelli/mai fun noodles cooked according to instruction on the package)
1 cup julienned or thinly sliced carrots
1 cup julienned or thinly sliced cucumber or zucchini
1 cup mint leaves or basil
1 cup cilantro or use basil
8 to 10  rice paper wrappers
This Date sweetned Peanut sauce
Quick Peanut sauce ((See notes))
My Sweet chili lime sauce

Instructions:
Mix the marinade ingredients until well combined. Slice the Tofu into thin rectangles and add to the bowl. (For variation, add 2 tsp sambal oelek or asian chile sauce, or chinese 5 spice.) Toss lightly. Chill for about an hour. (You can also bake the marinated tofu for 20 to 25 mins at 350 deg F(180C).)
Make your dipping sauce and set aside. Cook the noodles, drain and add to a bowl. Mix in 2 tbsp of the dipping sauce and toss well. (use 1 tbsp if using sweet chile lime sauce)
Prep your workstation with a large shallow bowl of warm water and a clean surface.
Dip rice paper wrapper in the shallow bowl for 30 seconds to a minute until softened. Transfer to the clean surface.
Arrange the layers on the wrappers. I start with some mint or basil on the third line of the wrapper, then tofu, then some julienned veggies and noodles in front, then some cilantro or mint.
Fold the rice paper wrapper from the bottom over the filling. Then fold in the sides, then continue to roll the bottom towards to the top keeping it tight. Seal and place on a serving plate. Cover with a damp towel until ready to serve. Serve with dipping sauce of choice
