Ingredients:
1.5 cups whole wheat flour
1.5 cups bread flour
1 tablespoon raw sugar  (or equivalent sweetener)
1 tablespoon virgin coconut oil
2 tablespoons water
1.5 teaspoon active yeast (I use Red star)
1 Tablespoon non dairy Yogurt  (or thick nut milk or water)
1/4 cup water
6-7  medium strawberries  (gives about 3/4 cup puree)
1/2 teaspoon salt

Instructions:
In a large bowl, add 2 Tablespoons warm water, 1 teaspoon sugar and yeast. Mix and let sit until frothy(10 minutes).
In a blender, blend the strawberries with water, sugar, salt and oil into a puree. Add in the yogurt/nut milk to the puree and mix.
Add 1.5 cups wheat flour and 1 cup bread flour to the yeast mix, and then add the strawberry puree over the flours.
Take a large spoon or spatula and mix it all for a minute or 2, scrape the sides and pat while mixing, till everything is well combined and distributed. Add spices like cinnamon if you like.
If the dough is very sticky, then add a little bread flour until the the dough is slightly sticky and soft.(bread flourr needed depends on how ripe/moist the strawberries are).
Cover with towel and let sit for 1.5 hours or until doubled.
Use the spoon to mix up the dough again and make into a ball.
Sprinkle a few Tablespoons bread flour on the dough. Oil your hands and move the dough so most of it is covered with some flour.( you can throw the dough on the counter top a couple of times at this point to develop more gluten:).
Pull a bit on all sides and tuck under. Place the tucked side down on parchment lined or well greased bread pan.
Spray water liberally on top, then sprinkle some flour or oats on top.
Cover with towel and let rise for 45 minutes or until doubled.
Bake at 365 degrees F for 35-40 minutes.
Cool completely before slicing
