1 large sweet potato, peeled and diced
2 tablespoons mild chili powder

Instructions:
In a large pot over medium heat, add the olive oil. Saute the diced onion for 3-4 minutes, until translucent, then add in the garlic and sweet potato and cook about 2 more minutes.
Next add the chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika and salt. Stir into the vegetable mixture.
Pour in the diced tomatoes along with their juices, drained and rinsed black beans and the 2 cups of water. Stir to combine. Simmer the mixture, uncovered, for 20-25 minutes.
Use the back of a spoon to mash some of the sweet potatoes for a thicker texture, if desired.
