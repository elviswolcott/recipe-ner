Ingredients:
1  onion, chopped
2  cloves of garlic, minced
1 tablespoon tomato paste
2 teaspoons all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white wine
1 teaspoon paprika powder
6 cups brown button mushrooms
1/2 cup shiitake mushrooms
3 teaspoons vegan sour cream
1 teaspoon lemon juice
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste
freshly chopped parsley

Instructions:
Finely chop the onion. Heat some oil in a large pan and sauté the onion for 2-3 minutes until they&#x27;re translucent. Add the garlic and cook it for another minute. 
Add the flour, the tomato paste, and the paprika powder and stir well. Cook for 2 minutes until lightly brown. 
Deglaze with white wine and simmer for a minute. 
Then add the mushrooms and stir well with a wooden spoon so they&#x27;re covered with the tomato paste onion mixture. Cook on high heat for 5 minutes. 
Add the vegan sour cream. Season with freshly pressed lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Serve immediately over pasta or mashed potatoes and sprinkle with freshly chopped parsley.
