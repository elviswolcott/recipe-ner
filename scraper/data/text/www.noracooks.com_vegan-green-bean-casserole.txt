Ingredients:
2  pounds fresh or frozen green beans
2 tablespoons olive oil
8 ounces mushrooms, sliced
5 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup vegetable broth
1/4 cup all purpose flour
1/2 cup unsweetened vegan creamer (I used coconut/almond)
1 1/2 cups unsweetened, unflavored soy, almond or cashew milk
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
6 ounces french fried onions (French's or Trader Joes)

Instructions:
Cook the Beans: Trim the ends, if using fresh beans. Bring a large pot of water to a boil, then add the beans and cook for 5 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. If you don&#039;t have a 10 inch cast iron skillet, lightly grease a large casserole dish and set aside.
Warm the oil in a large cast iron skillet (10 inches) over medium-high heat. Now add the mushrooms and garlic and cook for 3-5 minutes until the mushrooms are soft.
Sprinkle the flour on top of the mushrooms, then slowly add the vegetable broth and stir until the mixture thickens. Add the vegan creamer, then the non-dairy milk, stirring frequently for about 5 minutes until thick and creamy. Add salt to taste. Remove from heat.
To the skillet, add the green beans and 1/3 cup of the french fried onions. (If you don&#039;t have a cast iron skillet, add all ingredients to the casserole dish instead.)
Top with the rest of the french fried onions, place the cast iron skillet (or casserole dish) in the oven and cook for 15-20 minutes, until the onions are crispy but not burnt. Serve immediately.Â
