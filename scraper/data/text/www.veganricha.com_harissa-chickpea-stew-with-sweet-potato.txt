Ingredients:
1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
1 tsp paprika or smoked paprika
1/2 tsp guajillo or new mexico or other mild chili powder
1 tsp ground cumin or caraway
1 tsp ground coriander
zest of 1/2 a lime
2 tsp olive oil
1/2  medium onion (chopped)
5 cloves of garlic (finely chopped)
2 cup cooked chickpeas
7 to 8 oz cubed sweet potato (, about 1 large)
2 tbsp fresh mint
3/4 tsp salt ((less or more depending on if the chickpeas are salted))
1 cup water
2 tbsp tomato paste (or use 1/4 cup thick puree/sauce)
Cilantro (mint, lime and avocado for garnish)

Instructions:
Heat a skillet over medium heat. When the skillet is hot, add the red pepper flakes and toast them until they change color or get fragrant.
Add the paprika, cumin, coriander and mix for a few seconds. Add zest and oil and mix in. Add onion, garlic and a good pinch of salt and cook for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. If the spices start to burn or stick, add a splash of water and mix in. (Or use 1 tbsp or more harissa paste instead of the spices (pepper flakes to coriander). Cook the onion, garlic Add to the oil after the onion and garlic are starting to golden.)
Add the chickpeas, sweet potato, mint and salt and mix in. Cover and cook for 5 mins. Add water, tomato paste and mix in. *Cover and cook for 15 mins or until sweet potato is cooked through, stir once in between. Uncover and cook for a minute to reduce liquid if needed.&nbsp; *(add other veggies like red bell pepper, zucchini, eggplant for variation).
Taste and adjust salt and flavor. If the stew is too hot, add in some coconut milk or cashew cream and serve with avocado. If you used premade harissa paste, add more if needed and mix in(flavors vary with brand). Add some smoked paprika for smokyness, black pepper or cayenne for heat, cinnamon for flavor variation.
Garnish with cilantro, mint, a good splash of lime juice. Serve with crusty bread or flatbread.
