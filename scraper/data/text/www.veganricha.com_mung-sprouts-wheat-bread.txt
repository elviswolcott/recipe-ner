Ingredients:
2-3 cups whole wheat flour
1 cup bread flour
1  packet quick rise yeast and .5 teaspoon active yeast
1 cup water
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon Kashmiri Garam Masala (Or cinnamon powder, cloves powder, cardamom powder and some black pepper)
1 cup green mung bean sprouts ((2 day sprout of about the same length as the seed.. its warm these days))
1 tablespoon vegan butter
1/4 cup olive oil
oil or oil spray for greasing

Instructions:
Sprout the mung bean in a moist cloth in a dark place for 2 days or till the sprouts are the length of the seed. In winter it might take 3 days.
Coarsely grind the sprouts in a blender with a little water and keep aside.
Warm 1/4 cup (60ml) water and add yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar to it. Mix well and keep aside for 10 minutes.
Grease the mixer bowl and add the bread flour, 2 cups (240g) whole wheat flour, salt, kashmiri masala, sugar to it and mix well
Add in the olive oil, vegan butter, sprouts mixture and yeast mixture and some more water and knead. Add more water or flour as needed. The sprouts will make the bread more moist with time.
Knead for 10-12 minutes( batches of 3-4 minutes in the mixer with occasional scraping) until a soft and not too sticky dough is formed.
Place dough in well oiled container , lightly mist it with water then with oil spray, cover with plastic wrap, for 1.5 hours or until doubled.
Punch the dough down and knead for a minute. Add some flour to reduce stickiness.
Shape into loaf by pulling on all sides and tucking under.
Place loaf in greased bread pan. Mist top with water then with oil spray. Cover with towel and keep in warm place for 40 minutes.
Bake at 375 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until bread sounds hollow.
Cool completely before slicing. I usually put the cool bread in the refrigerator for an hour before slicing with my electric knife for some nice slices!
