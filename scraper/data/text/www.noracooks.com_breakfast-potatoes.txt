Ingredients:
5 pounds red potatoes, diced small
1 medium onion, chopped
1  red bell pepper, seeded and chopped
1  green bell pepper, seeded and chopped
5 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup olive oil
3/4 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 teaspoon salt

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Lightly spray a large rimmed pan (or two) with oil.
In a large bowl, combine the diced potatoes, onions, bell peppers, garlic, olive oil, smoked paprika and salt. Toss well until they are coated in olive oil.
Add the vegetables to the pan(s) and arrange in an even layer.
Bake for 45-60 minutes, stirring a little every 15 minutes, until the potatoes are golden brown in places. Use a metal spatula to scrape the potatoes from the pan, this will help with any sticking.
Serve with additional salt + pepper, to taste.
