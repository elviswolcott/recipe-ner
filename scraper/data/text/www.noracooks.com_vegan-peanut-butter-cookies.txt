Ingredients:
1/2 cup vegan butter, softened
3/4 cup creamy peanut butter
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons almond milk
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 1/4 cups all purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup granulated sugar, optional for rolling

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Add 1/4 cup sugar to a small bowl and set aside (for rolling the cookies in).
In a large bowl, cream together the vegan butter, peanut butter and sugars. Stir in the almond milk and vanilla until well combined. You can use a hand mixer, stand mixer or just a large wooden spoon.
Now add the flour to the bowl, and sprinkle the baking soda, baking powder, cornstarch and salt on top of the flour. Stir (or use the mixer) until just combined and a dough is formed. The dough will be thick, yet sticky.
Roll balls of dough (about 1.5 tablespoons) and then roll in the sugar until coated. Place each one on the prepared baking sheet, then press the tops to create the classic criss-cross pattern.Â 
Bake for 10-12 minutes until the cookies are very lightly golden brown; they will appear a bit underdone and soft but they continue to set as they cool.&nbsp;
Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack. These cookies will stay good at room temperature for about a week.
