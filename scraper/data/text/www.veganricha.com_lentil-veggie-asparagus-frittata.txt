Ingredients:
1/2 cup red lentils (masoor dal, split red lentils, or use Moong Dal )
1 cup water
1/4 cup almond meal
1 tbsp flax seed meal or chia seed meal
2 tsp starch like cornstarch or arrowroot starch
1 tsp baking powder
2/3 tsp salt
1/4 tsp turmeric for color (1/8 tsp or more Indian kala namak (Indian sulphur salt) - for the eggy taste (optional))
1/3 tsp each of garlic powder, chipotle pepper powder and garam masala (or use other spice blend and cayenne)
2 tsp extra virgin olive oil
2 tbsp or more nutritional yeast
2 tsp or more sun-dried tomato (optional)
1 tsp lemon juice
1 tsp oil
1/2 cup chopped onion
3  large cloves of garlic
1  loaded cup asparagus (chopped into 1 inch size bites)
2 cups chopped veggies. I use a cup cauliflower (small florets, 1/2 cup chopped carrots and some red bell pepper, peas, mushrooms etc.)
1/2 cup packed baby spinach (I used spinach + celery leaves + 1/4 cup chopped cilantro)
1/3 tsp salt or to taste
1/3 tsp chipotle pepper powder (a dash of black pepper)
1/4-1/2 tsp each oregano and thyme

Instructions:
Soak the lentils in hot water for at least 20 minutes. Soak them before you get the ingredients together as the rest of the steps will take about that much time. Prepare your pan by lining with parchment or greasing well. Preheat the oven to 365 degrees F / 180Âºc
