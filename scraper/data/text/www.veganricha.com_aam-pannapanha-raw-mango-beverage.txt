Ingredients:
1  raw unripe mango
1/4 cup jaggery or sugar.
1/4 tsp  salt or to taste
1/2 teaspoon black salt or chaat masala to taste
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder or cumin powder
1  mint leaf (optional)
1-2 teaspoon lemon juice (optional)
3-4 cups water

Instructions:
Peel and cube the mango and pressure cook with little water for 2-3 whistles.
Once cooled, blend the mango in a blender to make puree.
Add grated jaggery or sugar, salt, black pepper, black salt and blend again.
For variation in taste, add cardamom powder Or cumin powder but not both.
Add the rest of the water and crushed/chopped mint leaf and mix well.
Add lemon juice if needed. I used lemon juice because my mango was semi-ripe and not sour enough.
If the pulp is bothersome, then strain the drink before serving!
Chill and serve with ice cubes!
