Ingredients:
8 cups vegetable broth
20  dried shiitake mushrooms
3 tablespoons soy sauce or tamari
1  onion, finely chopped
2  cloves of garlic, minced
1/2 inch piece  fresh ginger, finely chopped
1 teaspoon miso paste
4 handful fresh spinach
7 oz firm tofu
2  carrots
dried ramen noodles (4 servings)
3  green onions, cut into rings
sesame

Instructions:
Cook the dried shiitake in the vegetable broth for 20 minutes. In another pot, cook the vegan ramen noodles according to the instructions on the package. Set aside when done.
In the meantime, finely chop the onion, the garlic, and the ginger. Sauté in a large pan (you will need it again for the tofu later). Set aside.
When the cooking time of the broth is over, carefully take out about half of the shiitake mushrooms with a ladle. Set aside for later. Let the soup cool down for a few minutes. Add the sautéed onion, garlic, and ginger to the soup as well as the miso paste. Then carefully transfer it into a high speed blender and process until fairly smooth. Transfer it back to the pot and simmer on low heat until you&#039;re done with the remaining steps.
Cut the cooked shiitake mushrooms into strips.
Cut the tofu into slices. Heat some oil (I used sesame oil) in the same pan that you used for the onions and pan-fry the tofu slices for about 2 minutes on each side on high heat. Add 1-2 teaspoons of soy sauce as well as some salt and pepper.
Grate the carrots. Just before serving, add the cooked ramen noodles, the fresh spinach, the cooked tofu, the shiitake mushrooms, and the carrots to the ramen broth. Garnish with green onions and sesame and serve immediately.
