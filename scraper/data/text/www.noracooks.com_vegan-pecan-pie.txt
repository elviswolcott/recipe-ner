Ingredients:
1  Vegan Pie Crust (*see Notes for other options)
2 tablespoons ground flaxseeds
4 tablespoons  water
4 tablespoons vegan butter, melted
3/4 cup dark corn syrup (*or maple syrup/brown rice syrup)
3/4 cup granulated sugar
3 tablespoons cornstarch
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
2 tablespoons bourbon, optional
2 cups coarse chopped pecans (10 oz), + more halves for decorating

Instructions:
Prepare a vegan pie crust (there is no need to pre-bake it) and line a pie plate with it. Stick the pie plate with the crust in the refrigerator until ready to fill it. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
Prepare the flax eggs: In a small bowl, stir together the ground flaxseeds and water, then set aside to let thicken. This is your egg substitute.
In a large bowl, add the melted vegan butter, corn syrup, flax eggs, sugar, cornstarch, vanilla and optional bourbon and whisk until well combined and smooth.
Roughly chop the pecans, but leave some whole if desired for decorating the top of the pie.
Carefully spread the pecans evenly into the unbaked pie crust. Pour the sugar mixture into the pie crust over the pecans, evenly.
Bake the pie for 60-65 minutes, until thick and bubbly and dark brown. It will still be quite liquidity until it cools so don’t cut into it right away. Use a pie crust shield after 15-20 minutes of baking if the crust starts to burn.
Remove from oven, sprinkle with coarse salt, if desired, and let cool on a wire rack. Let the pie cool at room temperature for 30 minutes at room temperature, then move it to the refrigerator to chill for at least 3 hours. Overnight is even better.
Slice and serve the pie with coconut whipped cream, if desired. Enjoy!
