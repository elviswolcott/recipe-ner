Ingredients:
1 cup unsweetened soy milk (or other non-dairy milk)
1/4 cup cornstarch
1 teaspoon ground flaxseeds
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons pure maple syrup
1 teaspoon vanilla
6-8 slices thick sliced quality bread, such as ciabatta or french
2-3 tablespoons vegan butter or coconut oil for frying
For serving: maple syrup, powdered sugar, or fresh fruit

Instructions:
In a shallow bowl, wide enough to hold a piece of bread, whisk together the soy milk, cornstarch, ground flaxseeds, baking powder, cinnamon, maple syrup and vanilla.
Add a little bit of vegan butter/coconut oil to a pan over medium-high heat and melt. Whisk the batter again right before dipping bread, as the cornstarch will settle to the bottom of the bowl.&nbsp;
Dip each side of the bread in the batter and let soak for about 10 seconds, then add the bread to the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, until golden brown. Add more vegan butter/oil to the pan as needed in between pieces of bread.&nbsp;
Serve with maple syrup, powdered sugar and fresh fruit, if desired.&nbsp;
