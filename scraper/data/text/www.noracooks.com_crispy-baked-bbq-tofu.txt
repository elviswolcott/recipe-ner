Ingredients:
(2)  14-ounce blocks firm or extra-firm tofu
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon salt
18 ounces (about 2 cups) your favorite BBQ sauce (*I used Kansas City Style)

Instructions:
Press the tofu by wrapping the blocks in paper towels or a clean tea towel. Place a plate or pan on top of the wrapped tofu, and put something heavy (such as a cast iron pan) on top of that. Let the tofu press for about 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and grease a large sheet pan.
Slice the tofu crosswise into 1/2 inch pieces, then slice each piece diagonally into 2 triangles. You can also simply cut the tofu into cubes or rectangles.
Add the tofu pieces to a large ziplock bag (I wash and re-use these). Now add the olive oil, cornstarch and salt, close the bag and very gently shake to coat the tofu.
Arrange on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes until golden on top. Remove from the oven briefly and pour on the bbq sauce, give it a little stir so the bbq sauce coats the tofu pieces and bake for another 10 minutes.
Remove from the oven and serve immediately. It can be stored in the refrigerator for 3-5 days, but it doesn&#039;t freeze well. You can reheat it in the microwave, air fryer, oven or the stovetop.
