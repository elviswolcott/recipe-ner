Ingredients:
1 1/2 cup non dairy milk such as almond milk
2  ripe bananas
1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice or cinnamon + nutmeg
sugar/sweetener as needed
a pinch of salt
3 to 4 tbsp chia seeds
2  ripe bananas  (sliced)
2 tbsp coconut sugar or vegan brown sugar
2 tbsp non dairy milk
a good pinch of cinnamon or nutmeg
1/4 cup chopped walnuts or pecans
2 tbsp flaked coconut

Instructions:
Blend all the ingredients under chia pudding except chia seeds until smooth. Or mash the banana and mix in with the rest of the ingredients. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat then take off heat. (I like to cook the mixture so the banana flavor intensifies and adds a more baked/caramelized banana bread flavor.)
Mix in the chia seeds into the hot mixture and let sit. Whisk again after 5 minutes then chill for atleast 15 minutes before layering. (Chia seeds can be mixed into the mixture without boiling as well. Mix in, refrigerate and mix after 15 mins to distribute the seeds well. Chill for a few hours to hydrate before layering)
Caramelize the bananas:&nbsp;Combine banana slices, sugar, non dairy milk, nutmeg and a pinch of salt in a skillet over medium heat. Cook until the mixture thickens, stirring occasionally. about 5 minutes.
Toast the walnuts or pecans on a skillet until fragrant (2 to 3 minutes). - optional
Layer the banana chia pudding in jars with toasted walnuts, caramelized bananas and flaked coconut. Top with some coconut flakes and a sprinkle of cinnamon or cardamom.
