Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1  medium onion, chopped
3  cloves garlic, minced
2  medium carrots, peeled and chopped
2  celery ribs, chopped
14- ounce can crushed or diced tomatoes
2 cups dry green or brown lentils
7 cups vegetable broth
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
3 cups baby spinach, sliced into ribbons (or kale)
1  lemon, juiced (about 2 tablespoons)

Instructions:
Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onions, garlic, carrots and celery. Cook, stirring frequently for about 4-5 minutes.
Now add the can of tomatoes (with juices), lentils, vegetable broth, cumin, coriander and smoked paprika. Stir to incorporate everything.
Bring to a boil, then lower heat to a simmer and cook for about 30 minutes, until the lentils are tender and the soup has thickened. For a creamier texture, use an immersion blender to blend a few times in the pot. Alternatively, add 1-2 cups of the soup to a regular blender, blend until smooth and then return to the pot.
Stir in the spinach and lemon juice. It will only take a minute for the spinach to wilt. Season with salt to taste.
