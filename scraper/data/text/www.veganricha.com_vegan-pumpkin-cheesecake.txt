Ingredients:
3/4 cup non dairy yogurt ((I use plain or vanilla kite hill almond yogurt))
1/3 cup cashews (, soaked for atleast an hour)
1 cup pumpkin puree
3 to 4 tbsp sugar
1.5 tsp pumpkin pie spice
1 tbsp cornstarch ( or arrowroot or potato starch)
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/4 tsp salt
1 to 1.5 tbsp lime juice ((depends on your preference of tang))
1  Pie crust of choice (vegan) (parbaked, use gluten-free pie crust if needed)

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Blend the cashews and yogurt until smooth. Add the rest of the ingredients and blend until smooth. You might need to scrape the sides depending on the blender as the mixture is thick.
Taste and adjust sweet and spice (it gets slightly sweeter and spicier on baking). Pour into prepared pie crust. I use graham cracker style.
Bake for 45 to 50 minutes. Cool completely, then chill for a few hours for it to set well. Slice and serve with whipped coconut cream or ice cream.
