Ingredients:
1 (16-oz) block extra-firm tofu
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 large green bell pepper, seeded and sliced
1 large  red bell pepper, seeded and sliced
1-2 more tablespoons olive oil
3-4  flour tortillas
white or brown rice, cooked
black or pinto beans, drained and rinsed
Vegan Sour Cream
Vegan Nacho Cheese
Salsa
lettuce, tomatoes, avocados or guacamole

Instructions:
First, press your tofu.Â Wrap the block of tofu in paper towels. Place a plate or pan on top of the wrapped tofu, and put a couple of heavy books or a cast iron pan on top of that. Let the tofu press for 20 minutes.
While the tofu is pressing, de-seed and slice the bell peppers and prepare any other burrito fillings you want.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and lightly grease a large sheet pan (you could also line with parchment paper).
Slice the tofu into about 6 thick slices. Now rip the tofu into bite sized pieces, not too small (about 1-2 inches) using your hands. You could simply cut the tofu into cubes, but ripping creates a more &quot;chicken-like&quot; texture.
Add the ripped tofu pieces to a large ziplock bag, along with the olive oil (1 tbs), cornstarch, salt, chili powder and onion powder. Close the bag and shake gently to coat the tofu. Arrange the tofu on one half of the sheet pan.
Arrange the sliced bell peppers on the other half of the pan, drizzle with a little more olive oil, if desired. Bake the tofu and peppers for about 30 minutes, stirring once at about 15 minutes.
Serve in flour tortillas or in a burrito bowl with optional rice, beans, vegan sour cream, guacamole, lettuce, tomatoes, salsa or vegan cheese. This serves about 3 regular servings or 2 large appetites. Double the recipe to serve a family of 4 or 5.
