Instructions:
Make the compote: Cook the ingredients in a skillet over medium heat until the cherries soften and the liquid thickens slightly. Cool for few minutes.&nbsp;
Blend the vanilla shake ingredients until smooth. Add a tbsp or so non dairy milk to help the blender if needed. Taste and adjust sweet. Scoop the mixture into 2 glasses.
In the same blender, Blend the chocolate layer + 2 tbsp of the cherry compote until smooth. Add some non dairy milk if needed. Taste and adjust sweet and blend in.
Spoon some of the cherry compote over the vanilla layer, reserve a few cherries for topping. Then pour or scoop the chocolate layer in the glass. Top with the remaining cherries and liquid if any. Serve immediately.
