Ingredients:
3/4 cup non dairy milk (, such as almond milk, soy milk)
1/3 cup raw sugar or light brown sugar or coconut sugar (, 1-2 tbsp more for sweeter)
3 tbsp chia seeds
3 tbsp oil
1/4 cup maple syrup
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1.5 cups flour ((I use 1 cup unbleached all purpose and 1/2 cup wheat))
1.5 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp spices like cinnamon (, optional)
1 cup shredded zucchini (, squeezed between paper towels to remove excess moisture)
1/3 cup chocolate chips (, plus more for topping)

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 365 deg F (190 C), line a loaf pan with parchment or grease well. Mix non dairy milk and chia seeds in a large bowl and let sit for 10 mins. Then whisk in the rest of the wet ingredients until well combined.&nbsp;
Fold in the zucchini. Add the dry ingredients (start with 1.25 cups flour if using&nbsp; more whole grain flour, and more a tbsp at a time), and mix to make a thick muffin like batter. Fold in the chocolate chips (and 1/4 cup chopped nuts if using). ( If omitting the chia seeds from the wet, you will need a bit more flour to get the thick batter).
Pour into prepared pan. Sprinkle 1 tbsp chocolate chips on top.
Bake at 365 degrees F (190 deg C) for 55 to 65 minutes or until a toothpick comes out almost clean from the center. (baking time will depend on the moisture content of the zucchini and the batter) . For a gluten-free bread, see&nbsp;GF Zucchini Loaf
