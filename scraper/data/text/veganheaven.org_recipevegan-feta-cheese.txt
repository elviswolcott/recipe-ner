Ingredients:
8 oz firm or extra-firm tofu
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon dried oregano
3  cloves of garlic, minced
1 teaspoon salt

Instructions:
Start by pressing your tofu to remove the excess water, so it will hold its shape better. Remove the tofu from the packaging. Place it in a tofu press and let it press for about 30 minutes. Alternatively you could also press your tofu without a tofu press. Wrap it with a clean dishtowel. Place it on a plate, cover it with a baking sheet, and then place something heavy on top. I usually use a stack of cookbooks. Leave it like this for 30 minutes. You could also skip this step if you want. 
Cut the tofu into cubes. 
Make the marinade. Place all ingredients in a bowl or a container with a lid and stir until well combined. 
Add the tofu cubes and carefully stir, so all tofu cubes are covered with the marinade. 
Cover with the lid and leave in the fridge overnight to marinate. 
Drain and get rid of the excess marinade. Use the tofu for salads or pasta recipes.
