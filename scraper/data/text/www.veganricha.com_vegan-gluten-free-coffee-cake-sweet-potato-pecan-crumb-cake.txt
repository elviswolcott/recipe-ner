Instructions:
In a bowl whisk all the dry ingredients really well.&nbsp;In another bowl mix the wet ingredients and mix to combine well.
Fold in the dry into the wet until mixed. Let the mixture sit to hydrate for 5 minutes. Meanwhile line the pan with parchment or grease. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
Transfer the stiff batter into the prepared pan. Even it out using a spatula.
Mix all the ingredients under crumb until the mixture sticks to form fat crumbs. Add more oil if needed.&nbsp;Spread the crumb mixture on top of the batter evenly.
Bake for 45 to 50 minutes or until toothpick from the center comes out almost clean.
Remove from pan after 5 minutes then let cool for another 15 mins before slicing. Serve as is or topped with whipped coconut cream or vegan ice cream.&nbsp;
