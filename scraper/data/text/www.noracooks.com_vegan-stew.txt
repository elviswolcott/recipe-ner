Ingredients:
3 cups warm water
1 tablespoon better than bouillon vegetable paste*
1 tablespoon soy sauce
8 ounce bag soy curls
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
3 tablespoons all purpose flour
2-3  tablespoons olive oil
1  onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup red wine (may leave out if needed)
6 cups vegetable broth
1 1/2 pounds potatoes, peeled and cubed (about 2 russets)
4 medium carrots, peeled and cut into 1 inch pieces
4  stalks celery, cut into 1 inch pieces
3 tablespoons tomato paste
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 cup cornstarch*
1/2 cup water
1 cup frozen green peas, thawed
salt + pepper, to taste
fresh chopped parsley, optional for garnish

Instructions:
Mix the warm water, better than bouillon paste and soy sauce in a large bowl. Add the soy curls and soak for 10 minutes until they are rehydrated. Drain, then add back to the bowl and toss with the garlic powder, pepper and flour.
In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the soy curls, onion and garlic, and sauté for 3-4 minutes. Now add the wine and vegetable broth and stir, scraping off any browned bits from the bottom.
Stir in the potatoes, carrots, celery, tomato paste, rosemary and thyme. Reduce heat to medium/low heat and simmer for about 30 minutes until the vegetables are tender.
In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch and water together to make a slurry. Slowly add the slurry to the pot, stirring, until you have reached a thick consistency. You may not need all of the slurry. 
Stir in the peas and simmer for about 5 minutes, then season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve with chopped parsley and perhaps a side of crusty bread, biscuits or salad. Enjoy!
