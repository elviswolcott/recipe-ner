Ingredients:
2 cups all purpose flour
1/3 cup brown sugar, packed
2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice mix
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup vegan butter (earth balance brand preferred), cold and cut into small cubes or pieces
1/2 cup pumpkin puree
2 tablespoons almond milk
1/4 cup applesauce
1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
1 cup powdered sugar
1-2 tablespoons almond milk
1 cup powdered sugar
1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice mix
1-2 tablespoons almond milk

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and lightly grease a large baking sheet (or line with parchment paper).
In a large bowl, combine the flour, brown sugar, pumpkin pie spice mix, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Add the cold vegan butter, and use a pastry cutter or your hands to work the butter into the dry ingredients. It should resemble coarse crumbs.
Now dump in the pumpkin puree, almond milk, applesauce and vanilla. Mix with a large wooden spoon until a soft dough forms.
On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough a few times until it comes together. Flatten the dough with your hands (lightly flour your hands if sticky). Flatten it into a circle, about 1 inch thick.
Using a pizza cutter or large knife, cut it like you would a pizza, into 8 pieces (see photos above for reference).
Place on prepared baking sheet and bake for 14-16 minutes, until lightly golden brown on top.
