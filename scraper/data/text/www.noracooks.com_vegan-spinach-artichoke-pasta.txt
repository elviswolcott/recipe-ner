Ingredients:
16 ounces penne pasta
1 1/2 cups raw cashews, soaked
1 1/2 cups unsweetened cashew, soy or almond milk
1/4 cup  nutritional yeast
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
4 cups loosely packed baby spinach
(2) 14-ounce cans artichokes, water packed, drained well
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 small onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced

Instructions:
Cook the pasta in boiling water according to package instructions, then drain and set aside. Save some (about a cup) of the pasta water for adding back in later.
Soak the cashews in boiling hot water for 5 minutes, then drain and add to a high powered blender, along with the milk, nutritional yeast, lemon juice and salt. Blend until very smooth.
To the blender, add the spinach and artichokes, and pulse a few times, using the tamper, being careful not to blend too much as you want to leave a good amount of texture. Set aside.
In the same pot you used to cook the pasta, add a tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat, then add the onion and garlic and saut√© for 3-4 minutes until translucent.
Now add the creamy mixture from the blender, and stir, cooking for 2-3 minutes until it thickens somewhat. Be careful not to burn the bottom.
Now add the cooked pasta, and stir to mix. I usually add some of the water, 1/2 cup or more, if it&#039;s too thick. Serve immediately and enjoy!
