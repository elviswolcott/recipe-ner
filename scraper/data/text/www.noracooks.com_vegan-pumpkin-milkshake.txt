Ingredients:
2 cups non-dairy vanilla ice cream*
1/2 cup canned pumpkin puree
1/2 cup non-dairy milk*
1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
Vegan Whipped Cream

Instructions:
In a blender, blend together non-dairy ice cream, pumpkin puree, non-dairy milk and pumpkin pie spice.
Pour into glasses and garnish with non-dairy whipped cream. I used almond whipped cream from the store, but you could make your own Vegan Whipped Cream if you want.
