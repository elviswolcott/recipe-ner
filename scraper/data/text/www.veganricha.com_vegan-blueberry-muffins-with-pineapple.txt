Ingredients:
1/2 cup vegan cream cheese ((I use kite hill almond plain) Or Use cashew cream or vegan yogurt)
1/2 cup + 2 tbsp non dairy milk
3 tbsp oil (or use more non dairy milk)
2 tbsp maple syrup (or use 2 tbsp sugar + 1 tbsp non dairy milk)
1/3 cup vegan sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract
1.5 cups flour ((I use a combination of unbleached all purpose and whole wheat))
2 tsp baking powder
1/8 tsp salt
1/2 cup wild blueberries ((frozen or fresh))
1/2 cup chopped pineapple (or use 1/4 cup more berries)

Instructions:
Line a muffin pan. Preheat the oven to 365 degrees F(185 C). Blend the wet ingredients in a blender with 1/2 cup non dairy milk. Add to a bowl. Use 2 tbsp more dairy milk to rinse out the blender and add to the bowl. (or add all the wet ingredients to a bowl, mix with a spoon until smooth and well combined)
Add 1 cup flour, salt, baking powder to a bowl, mix well. (You can add spices/flavors at this point like cinnamon, nutmeg or some lemon zest). Add to the wet.
In the same dry bowl, add 1/2 cup flour, blueberries and pineapple and toss to coat. Add to the wet bowl and mix in. The batter should be thick and stiff. If it is too stiff, add a tbsp of non dairy milk and mix in.&nbsp;
Drop the thick batter onto lined muffin pan. Bake at 365 degrees F for 22 to 25 mins. (To bake a loaf, bake for 40 to 50 mins)
Cool completely and frost or glaze. I use this cashew vanilla frosting. A simple vanilla or lemon icing will work well too. Store on the counter for a few hours and refrigerate for upto 3 days. This muffin also does well with a cinnamon streusel topping. The muffin tastes more cheesecakey after sitting for a day.&nbsp;
