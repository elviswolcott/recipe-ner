Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour (You could also use whole wheat flour)
2 cups cold almond milk
2 teaspoons baking powder
2 tablespoons canola oil
1 pinch salt
2 teaspoons natural vanilla extract
3 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons unsweetened apple sauce
1 glas morello cherries
4 tablespoons of the syrup the cherries are in
1 tablespoon corn starch
powdered sugar
cinnamon
maple syrup

Instructions:
For the waffles, combine all ingredients in a medium-sized bowl and stir well with a wooden spoon. Lightly grease a waffle iron and make six waffles.
In the meantime, make the cherry sauce. Drain the cherries. Keep some of the syrup the cherries are in as you'll need it later on. Transfer the cherries to a small pot and heat them up. Combine the corn starch with two tablespoons of water and add them to the cherries together with the syrup. Cook for about 3 minutes or until it thickens up.
Serve the waffles with the cherry sauce and sprinkle with cinnamon and powdered sugar. If you want you can also add some maple syrup.
