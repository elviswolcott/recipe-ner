Ingredients:
3 tablespoons ground flaxseeds
5 tablespoons water
1 1/2 cups canned chickpeas, drained
1  onion, chopped
1  clove of garlic, minced
1/2 cup whole wheat bread crumbs
1/2 cup rolled oats, ground to oat flour
6  mushrooms, cut into small pieces
1 cup fresh parsley, chopped
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon paprika powder
1 tablespoon oregano
1 tablespoon basil
1/2 cup rolled oats
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste
red pepper flakes, to taste
4  whole wheat buns
2  tomatoes
1  red onion, cut into rings
4 tablespoons sunflower tomato spread (You can also use ketchup, mustard, or any other burger sauce instead.)
lettuce

Instructions:
Combine the ground flax seeds with the water and put aside to soak. In a large bowl, mash the chickpeas with a fork, leaving some chickpeas intact for texture.
Put 1/2 cup of rolled oats into a blender or food processor and ground into a fine powder of flour by pulsing several times.
In a small pan, heat some oil and saut√© the onions and the garlic for about 3 minutes. Together with the remaining ingredients, add them to the chickpeas and mix well. Form four large burger patties (or 6 smaller ones).
Line a baking tray with parchment paper and put the burger patties on top. Bake for 30 minutes at 350 F. Flip them after the first 15 minutes.
Cut the whole wheat buns in halves and cover both halves with the sunflower tomato spread. Alternatively you can of course also use ketchup, mustard, or any other burger sauce. Serve the mushrooms burgers with tomatoes, lettuce, and red onions.
