Ingredients:
4  tortillas
1/2  green bell pepper
1/2  red bell pepper
1/2  yellow bell pepper
1 cup black beans
2 cups baby spinach
1 cup vegan cream cheese or vegan sour cream
1/2 cup vegan shredded cheese
1 cup veggie ground meat
1 teaspoon cumin
1 teaspoon paprika powder
1/4 teaspoon chili powder

Instructions:
Thinly slice the bell peppers. 
Put each tortilla wrap on a plate or large cutting board. Spread a thin layer of either vegan cream cheese or sour cream on top of each tortilla. Combine the spices in a small bowl. Sprinkle each tortilla with the spices. 
Heat the veggie ground meat in a pan on the stovetop. Season it with Mexican spices if necessary (most brands are already seasoned and you don&#x27;t have to do much).
Then place a line of baby spinach on top. Next a line of black beans, veggie ground meat, bell peppers, and vegan cheese. Then put a bit of the salsa on top. 
Tightly roll up the tortilla. Slice off the ends and and then cut the remaining tortilla into 6-8 pieces depending on the size of your tortilla. Serve them with salsa or enjoy them on their own!
