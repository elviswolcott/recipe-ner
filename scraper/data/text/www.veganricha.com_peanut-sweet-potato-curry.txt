Ingredients:
1 tsp oil
1/2 cup chopped onion
3 cloves of garlic minced
1 inch ginger minced
1 cup cauliflower florets
1/2  bell pepper green or red (chopped)
1  small sweet potato peeled and cubed
1/2 tsp salt
3 tbsp peanut butter or other nut butter or sun butter to make it nut-free
1 tbsp lime or lemon juice
1 to 2 tsp sugar or maple syrup
1/2 tsp distilled white or apple cider vinegar
1/4 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp pepper flakes
1 tsp sesame oil
1 cup or more water or use light coconut milk for creamier
1/2 cup peas (thawed if frozen)
black pepper to taste
garam masala or curry powder to taste (optional)
lemon juice and cayenne
basil and peanuts for garnish

Instructions:
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until translucent. Fold in the ginger.
Add peppers, cauliflower, sweet potato and a dash of black pepper and cook for 3 minutes.
Add the rest of the ingredients till peas and mix well. It will take a few minutes for the nut butter to incorporate. Partially cover and cook for 15 minutes. (You can also add a cup of cooked chickpeas or lentils at this time or fold in some kale now or spinach with the peas).
Taste and adjust salt, sweet and heat. Add a dash of lemon and cayenne if needed. You can also fold in a bit of garam masala or curry powder.
Add in the peas. Simmer for another few minutes if needed or until the vegetables are cooked to preference. Adjust consistency if needed with more water or non dairy milk.
Serve over rice or grains or with toasted pita bread/flatbread. Add some more water during simmering to serve as soup. Can be served hot or cold. I usually garnish with basil or cilantro, pepper flakes and peanuts.
