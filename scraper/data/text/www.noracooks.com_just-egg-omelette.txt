Ingredients:
1 teaspoon vegan butter
1/2 cup chopped small broccoli
1 cup baby spinach
1/2 cup liquid JUST Egg
1 tablespoon all purpose flour (or gluten free flour)
1/8 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon black salt
1 teaspoon vegan butter
1/4 cup shredded vegan cheese
hot sauce, sliced avocado, chopped green onions, cherry tomatoes, fresh herbs

Instructions:
In a small pan (8 inch is best), melt a teaspoon of vegan butter over medium-high heat.  Sauté the chopped veggies and spinach until softened a bit, and season with a little salt + pepper, to taste. Remove from the pan and set aside on a plate nearby. Turn the heat down to medium-low.
In a small bowl, quickly whisk the Just Egg with the flour, baking powder and black salt until combined.
Melt the second teaspoon of vegan butter in the pan, then pour in your &quot;egg&quot; mixture. Tilt the pan a little if needed to encourage it to spread into an even circle.
Cover the pan and let it cook for about 2-3 minutes, until it looks mostly cooked and no longer liquidity on top. Make sure your pan isn&#39;t too hot or it won&#39;t cook well and the bottom will burn. If it takes a little longer, that&#39;s okay.
Once the top looks done, add your sautéed veggies and shredded cheese, if using, to one side of the omelette. Now fold over one side to cover your fillings, cover and let cook for another few minutes until the cheese it melty.
Serve immediately with extra toppings of choice. I like Sriracha hot sauce, black pepper, chopped green onions and a few slices of avocado.
