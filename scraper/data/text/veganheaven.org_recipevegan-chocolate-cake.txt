Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup cocoa powder
3/4 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons baking powder
1 teaspoon natural vanilla extract
1 cup almond milk
3/4 cup unsweetened apple sauce
1/2 cup canola oil
2  avocado
1/2 cup cocoa powder
1/4 cup agave or maple syrup
1 tablespoon melted coconut oil
1 teaspoon natural vanilla extract
fresh berries (I used raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, and cherries)
pistachios

Instructions:
Preheat your oven to 350 °F. In a large bowl, combine all dry ingredients (flour, brown sugar, baking powder, and cocoa powder). Stir well with a wooden spoon.
Add the wet ingredients (oil, almond milk, unsweetened apple sauce, vanilla extract). 
Stir well with a wooden spoon until you&#039;ve got a smooth batter. 
Lightly grease a 10 inch springform pan with vegan butter or margarine. 
Pour the batter into the springform pan. Bake at 350 °F for 30 minutes. It&#039;s best to test with a skewer to see if the cake is done or if you need to adjust the baking time a little bit as every oven is a bit different. Remove from the oven and allow to cool down for about 30 minutes.
Make the vegan chocolate frosting. In a food processor combine all ingredients and blend until smooth. Evenly spread the avocado chocolate frosting on the chocolate cake. Sprinkle with pistachios and top with fresh berries. Enjoy!
