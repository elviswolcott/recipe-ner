Ingredients:
1.5 cups flour
1/2 tsp salt ((2/3 if you like biscuits salty))
2.5 tsp baking power
1/4 tsp baking soda
2 tsp dried herbs ((I used basil, rosemary and chives, 1 tbsp if fresh))
1/4 cup mashed sweet potato or mashed potato ((chilled for at least an hour))
1/3 cup coconut cream ((heaping cup - chilled overnight))
1/3 cup non dairy milk ((such as almond or soy))
2 tsp lime juice
Vegan cheese shreds, 1 tbsp nutritional yeast, 1/2 tsp garlic powder or minced jalapeno

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 425 deg F ( 218 C). Line a thick baking sheet with parchment paper.
Add the flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, herbs to a shallow bowl. Whisk to mix well.
Mix the lime juice in the non dairy milk and set aside.
Add the chilled sweet potato mash and coconut cream. Use a pastry cutter or fork to mix them in until the flour has some even fat crumbs.
Add the curdled non dairy milk a few tbsp at&nbsp; a time. Use a spatula to mix it in until just about a dough.
Use a tablespoon of flour if needed and quickly bring the dough together into a flat rectangle with the spatula or hands.
Use a 1.5 inch cookie cutter to cut out biscuits. Place biscuits on parchment lined baking sheet just about touching each other. Press the middle of the biscuits lightly with a finger, to make a slight dip. (Freeze the shaped biscuits on a baking sheet. When frozen, store in air tight container or bag. Bake directly from the freezer. You will need to add 3 to 4 mins additional baking time for frozen biscuits)
Bake for 13 to 15 mins. Take off the sheet when done.
Brush with vegan butter/oil if needed, or brush some aquafaba. Serve immediately with gravy of choice. These biscuits are best served warm.&nbsp;
