Ingredients:
1/2 cup + 2 Tbsp almond flour
1/2 cup oat flour
1/4 to 1/3 cup ground raw sugar
1/4 tsp cinnamon
a generous pinch of salt
1 Tbsp melted coconut oil
1 Tbsp non dairy yogurt  (or cashew cream)
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1  loaded cup strawberries
1 cup blueberries
1/4 cup raw sugar
1 cup non dairy coconut milk yogurt  (or other non dairy yogurt)
1/4 cup thick cashew cream  (or coconut cream)
1 Tbsp coconut oil
1 tsp vanilla extract

Instructions:
Make the crust: Mix the almond flour, oat flour, ground sugar, cinnamon, salt. Add the oil and mix to make crumbs. Add yogurt, vanilla and mix so the mixture becomes a dough. Add more oat flour if too wet. Press into parchment lined pan.
Make the yogurt berry filling: Blend the strawberries and 2/3 cup blueberries and sugar into a smooth puree. Add to a pan and cook on medium heat until bubbly. 6 to 7 mins. Let cool for a few minutes. Add coconut oil and vanilla extract and mix in. Then fold in the yogurt, cashew cream and 1/3 cup fresh blueberries. do not mix too much so you have a few berry and yogurt swirls. Pour into the pan. Cover and freeze for a few hours until set. Slice and serve.
For variations: double the crust and make sandwich bars. Or make them into popsicles!
