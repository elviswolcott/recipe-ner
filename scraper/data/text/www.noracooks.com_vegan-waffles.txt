Ingredients:
1/4 cup ground flaxseeds
1/2  cup water
3 1/2 cups soy milk
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
2 cups all purpose flour
1 1/2 cups whole wheat pastry flour
2 tablespoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup melted coconut oil
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract

Instructions:
Preheat waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.
Make the Flax Eggs: In a small bowl, combine the ground flax and water. Stir, and set aside to thicken.
Make the Vegan Buttermilk: If your milk is cold, warm it for a minute in the microwave, otherwise it will cause the coconut oil to harden in the batter. In a large measuring cup or bowl, measure 3 1/2 cups of soy milk. Add the apple cider vinegar, stir a little with a spoon and set aside to curdle.Â 
In a large bowl, whisk together the flours, baking powder, salt and sugar.&nbsp;
Add the flax eggs, vegan buttermilk, melted coconut oil and vanilla to the dry ingredients. Stir until just combined with a large wooden spoon, being careful not to over mix. The batter should be fairly thick, if it's too runny add a few tablespoons more of flour. If it's too thick, add a little more water.
Spray waffle iron with oil (unless your waffle iron is non-stick). Pour the recommended amount of batter onto hot waffle iron, and cook until the waffle is golden brown on both sides.
Serve immediately, or keep in a warm oven (200 degrees F) until ready to serve. Top with fresh berries, coconut whip, vegan butter, maple syrup and anything else you desire!
