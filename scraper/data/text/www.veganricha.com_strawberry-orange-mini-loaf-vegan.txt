Ingredients:
2/3 cups whole wheat flour
2/3 cups bread flour
1 teaspoon vital wheat gluten
1 teaspoon flax meal
1 tablespoons raw sugar
1.5 teaspoons active yeast
1/3 cup water
7-8  medium organic strawberries pureed
2 tablespoons Orange Marmalade
1 tablespoon Organic canola oil
1/2 teaspoon salt

Instructions:
Add the yeast and sugar to 1/4 cup (60ml) warm water and mix well. Let stand for 10 minutes or until frothy.
In a blender, puree the strawberries.
Add in the flax meal, orange marmalade, a tablespoon of hot water to the puree and blend and keep aside.
In a bowl add the flours, wheat gluten and salt and mix.
Add in the yeast mixture, oil and fruit puree.
Knead the dough for 8-10 minutes, scraping sides every 2-3 minutes. add more flour or water in little quantities if needed. As with any fruit bread, the fruit gives out a little extra moisture than a normal bread while the dough sits for the rising time. The dough should be soft and not too sticky.
Spritz the top of dough with some oil spray. Place dough in a covered container in a warm place for 1.5 hours.
Punch it lightly and shape into a loaf by pulling on all sides, or by rolling it out into a rectangle and rolling the rectangle from one side and tucking the other edge under.
Place loaf in greased mini bread pans. Spritz the top with water and then spritz a little oil spray and cover with damp towel.
Place it in a warm place or warm oven for 50 minutes.
Remove towel, spritz top with some water and bake at 365 degrees F for 25 minutes. (30 minutes if using making one loaf of all of the dough)
Remove bread from pan and let cool for an hour.
I usually refrigerate it for another hour before slicing. The breads are usually quite fluffy and soft and refrigeration makes them a bit firm for nice and clean slices!
