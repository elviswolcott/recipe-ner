Ingredients:
2 cups rolled oats
3 teaspoons cinnamon
1 teaspoon natural vanilla extract
4 tablespoons maple syrup
1/4 cup chia seeds
1/2 cup flaked or slivered almonds
1/4 cup pumpkin seeds
1/4 cup sunflower seeds
1/4 cup shredded coconut (unsweetened)
1  tablespoon coconut sugar
2 tablespoons flaxseeds

Instructions:
Preheat your oven to 300 F.  In a large bowl, combine the rolled oats, the cinnamon, the vanilla extract, and the maple syrup. 
 Stir until well combined. The mixture will be pretty sticky.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and place the rolled oat maple syrup mixture on top. Spread evenly. Bake for 8-10 minutes at 300 F. Check regularly to avoid burning. The oats burn pretty quickly and every oven is a bit different. They should be lightly golden on top.&nbsp;
In a large bowl, combine the baked oats with the chia seeds, the coconut sugar, the sunflower seeds, the pumpkin seeds, the almonds, and the shredded coconut.&nbsp;
Stir until well combined. Serve with fresh fruits, plant-based yogurt, or milk.&nbsp;
