Ingredients:
1/2 cup oats
1/4 cup self rising flour ((2 tablespoons))
1/4 cup whole wheat pastry flour
1 teaspoon cocoa powder ((optional))
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon powder
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg powder ((can add some cloves, cardamom or all spice as well))
1/8 teaspoon cardamom powder
3 tablespoons granulated raw sugar ((1-2 Tbsps more if you want sweeter cookies))
2 tablespoons agave syrup
1 tablespoon vegan butter
2 tablespoons oil
1 teaspoon flax seed meal
1 tablespoon warm water
1-2 teaspoon orange or lime juice
1/2 cup or more vegan chocolate chips

Instructions:
Mix 1 teaspoon flax seed meal with 1 Tablespoon of warm water till well blended into a paste and not dry.
In a large bowl, blend together oil , agave syrup, butter and sugar using an electric mixer for 2-3 minutes. Add in the flax meal mixture and blend again til the sugar does not look granulated and the mixture is a bit fluffy. It wont be fluffy like butter and sugar mix, but will feel lighter.
In a separate bowl, mix in the flours, baking powder, oats, spices and salt and mix well.
Add half of the flour into the the sugar mixture and mix a bit. Add in the rest and mix. If the mixture appears too dry, add in a teaspoon or 2 of orange juice or lemon juice,. I used lemon juice. Or if the mixture is runny, add in some whole wheat pastry flour 1 teaspoon at a time.
Add in the chocolate chips and mix until just about combined well.
Keep mixture in the refrigerator for half an hour.
Spoon mixture on baking sheet an inch apart. You can make balls for a defined cookie shape as well.
Bake at preheated 350 degrees F for 12-15 minutes. a few minutes more or less depending on the oven and the size of the dough balls. The cookies should start browning on the edges and the center should be soft, but not liquid/runny.
Cool on rack for 10-15 minutes before finishing them off!
