Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups raw cashews
1 1/2 cups water

Instructions:
Bring 3 cups of water to a boil. Pour the hot water over the cashews and let soak for at least 5 minutes, or up to 3 hours.
Drain the cashews and discard the soaking water. Add them to a high powered blender along with 1 1/2 cups of fresh water and blend for a few minutes until very smooth and creamy.
Use immediately anywhere you would heavy cream, or store in a covered container in the refrigerator until ready to use. It will keep in the refrigerator for about 1 week.
