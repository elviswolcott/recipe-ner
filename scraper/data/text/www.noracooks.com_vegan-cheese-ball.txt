Ingredients:
2 cups raw cashews
3 tablespoons lemon juice (from 1-2 lemons)
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2-1 teaspoon dried dill (or 1-2 tablespoons fresh dill)
4 ounces vegan cream cheese (1/2 of a 8 ounce container)
1/2 cup pecans, chopped small

Instructions:
In a medium bowl, cover the raw cashews with boiling hot water. Let them soak for 5 minutes.
Drain the cashews, and add to a food processor, along with the lemon juice, onion powder, garlic powder, salt and dill. Blend until smooth, 1-2 minutes, scraping down the sides as needed.&nbsp;
Now add the vegan cream cheese, and blend it in. It should be very creamy and smooth. Taste and adjust seasonings to taste, it should be very flavorful!
Place a clean tea towel in a small-medium sized bowl. Using a spatula, scoop all of the cheese into the bowl. Gather the corners of the towel and gently twist the top (SEE PHOTOS ABOVE).&nbsp;
Place the bowl with the cheese ball in the refrigerator and chill for 4-6 hours, or overnight. The cheese will harden considerably in this time.
When ready to serve, unwrap the cheese ball and roll it gently in the chopped pecans until coated.
Serve with crackers and/or vegetables like carrot sticks, celery and cucumbers. Enjoy!
The cheese ball will stay firm for a few hours at room temperature, but try not to leave it out for longer than that. Return it the the refrigerator and cover with plastic wrap to save. Leftover cheese will last 4-5 days.
