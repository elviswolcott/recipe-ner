Ingredients:
1/4 cup maple syrup
1/4 cup coconut sugar or other sugar of choice (use 1 tbsp less for less sweet)
2 Tbsp oil (or use applesauce or aquafaba)
1/2 to 1 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/2 cup flour (I use spelt or unbleached white. Use certified gf oat flour to make these gluten-free)
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/8 tsp salt
1/4 cup almond meal
1 cup old fashioned oats
1/3 to 1/2 cup vegan chocolate chunks
3 tbsp chopped walnuts

Instructions:
In a bowl combine all the wet ingredients and mix until sugar is well combined. (powder the sugar in a blender before using if it is granulated to help with quick mixing on this step.)
Whisk flour, baking powder, salt and almond meal and add to the wet. Add in the oats and mix until well combined. (add a bit less or more oats depending on the wet mixture. measurements vary and you want the mixture to be soft somewhat sticky). Add in the chocolate chunks and walnuts. Fold in to distribute evenly. The dough will be somewhat sticky. (Add more flour of too wet, or a dash of non dairy milk if too dry). I added 2 tbsp mini chocolate chips as well for some extra chocolate per bite.
Chill for 15 minutes. Take 2 to 3 tbsp of the dough and make large cookies. Flatten lightly on the sheet. Press the leftover chocolate chunks (there will be few towards the end), into the shaped cookies.
Preheat the oven to 365 degrees F/ 180c. Place baking sheet on the center rack. Bake for 11 to 12 minutes.
Cool for 10 minutes before serving .
