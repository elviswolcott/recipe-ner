Ingredients:
1/2 cup pumpkin puree
2 tbsp oil ((organic safflower or coconut))
1/4 cup maple syrup
3/4 cup almond milk ( or other non dairy milk to make nut-free)
1 tsp vinegar ((apple cider or white))
1/2 cup flour ((I use unbleached all purpose))
1.5 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1 tsp pumpkin pie spice ((more or less to preference))
1/3 tsp saltÂ  ((or scant 1/2 tsp))
3/4 cup fine or medium cornmeal

Instructions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease or line a 9 by 5 inch loaf pan.
In a bowl, combine all the wet ingredients and mix well. Sift in the flour, baking powder, soda, spices and salt.
Add in the cornmeal and mix to combine. Transfer the batter to prepared loaf pan and use a spatula to even it out.&nbsp;
Bake for 34 to 37 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes then remove from pan and cool for another 10 minutes before slicing. (You can also bake the batter into cornbread muffins. Bake for 20-24 minutes).
