Ingredients:
1 cup  mashed bananas (about 2 medium bananas)
1/3 cup sugar (such as coconut sugar, light brown sugar (1/4 cup for less sweet or if the bananas are very ripe ))
1/4 cup maple syrup
1 tsp vanilla extract
2 tbsp oil (omit to make oil free)
1/3 cup almond milk
1 tsp vinegar
1 tbsp molasses
1 3/4 cup flour ((I use 1 1/4 all purpose, and 1/2 cup of whole wheat or spelt))
1/4 cup almond flour
1.5 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1-1.5 tsp gingerbread spice (or a mix of 1 tsp cinnamon,1/4 tsp ginger , 1/8 tsp cloves, nutmeg, allspice )
2 tbsp chopped candied ginger (optional )
Chopped walnuts/pecans
Chopped Dates (other dried fruits)

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 365 degrees F (185 C), and line a 9x5 or 8.5x4.5 inch loaf pan with parchment.
In a bowl mix all the wet ingredients till well combined.
In another bowl, mix the flours ,the baking powder, baking soda, salt, and spices until well combined, then mix in the candied ginger.
Add 1 3/4 cup of the dried mixture to the wet mixture, and mix in. Add the rest of the dry flour mix 1 tbsp at a time until it is a stiff muffin batter. If it is not stiff enough, add another 1 or two tbsp of flour
Transfer the batter to the lined loaf pan, and even it out with a spatula. Sprinkle the top with 1 tbsp of brown sugar, and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. This is optional, but I like the crust it gives the banana bread. You can also add some candied ginger on top, or some pecans tossed in maple syrup for a candied pecan top
Bake for 55 minutes. Check with a toothpick from the center of the loaf, if it comes out clean, then remove from the oven else bake for another 5-10. cool the loaf for 10 minutes before taking out of the pan. Then cool completely before slicing.
