Ingredients:
1/4 cup coconut milk  (or other non-dairy milk)
1.5 Tbsp starch (like cornstarch or arrowroot starch)
1.5 cups pumpkin puree  (1 15 oz can, or use sweet potato puree)
1/4 cup coconut sugar or ground raw sugar (use less if using semi sweet chocolate instead of dark chocolate)
1 tsp pumpkin pie spice (or 3/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ginger, generous pinch of cloves and nutmeg)
3 oz  70% dark chocolate (( 3 oz or about 2/3 cup), chopped )
1/2 cup vegan semi-sweet chocolate
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 x prepared and pre-baked Almond Crust  (or any other crust: see no-bake crust options on the blog)

Instructions:
In a saucepan over medium heat, add milk and starch and mix well. Add pumpkin puree, sugar, and spices and mix well. Bring the filling to a boil and let cook for about 5 minutes, stirring. The filling will thicken during that time.
Take the pot off the heat. Add the chopped dark and semi-sweet chocolate and let sit for 2 minutes. Then mix well with a spatula or whisk until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth.
Add in the vanilla extract and mix in. Taste the filling and adjust the level of sweetness if needed.
Pour the filling into a pre-baked crust like my Almond flour pie crust or any other pie/tart crust on the blog. Even the filling out using a spatula.
Chill the pie 2 to 3 hours and serve.
For clean slices, put the pie in the freezer for half an hour to an hour, then slice. Serve as is or with whipped coconut cream or a drizzle of salted caramel.
