Ingredients:
1 (8-ounce) package tempeh
1/2  green bell pepper, seeded and chopped
1/2 medium onion, chopped
1-2 cups barbecue sauce | (homemade or store bought)
4  buns or rolls
1 recipe vegan coleslaw | (optional, for serving)

Instructions:
Crumble the tempeh into a large skillet, then add 1/4 cup water, chopped green peppers and onions. Cook over medium-high heat for 5-10 minutes, until the water is mostly gone.&nbsp;
Add 1-2 cups of barbecue sauce to the skillet, stir and cook for 5 more minutes. How much sauce you add depends on how saucy you want your sandwiches to be.
Serve on buns or rolls with vegan coleslaw, if desired. Pickles taste really good on this sandwich, too. Enjoy!
