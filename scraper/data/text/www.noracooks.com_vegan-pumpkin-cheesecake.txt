Coconut Whipped Cream (or storebought non-dairy whip)

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Wrap a 9-inch springform pan with 1-2 layers of aluminum foil, covering the bottom and the sides. If you skip this part, oil will leak out causing your oven to smoke, so don&#39;t skip it! Cut a circle of parchment paper for the bottom of the pan and spray the pan lightly with oil.
