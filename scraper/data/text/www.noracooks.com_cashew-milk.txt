Ingredients:
1 cup raw cashews
4 cups water
1-2 tablespoons pure maple syrup, or more to taste
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
tiny pinch of salt, optional

Instructions:
Quick soak the cashews: Add the cashews to a small pot and cover with 3 cups of water. Bring to a boil, then remove from heat and let soak for 15 minutes. Alternatively, you can soak them overnight.
Drain the cashews, then add them to a high speed blender, along with the 4 cups of fresh water and maple syrup/vanilla, if desired, for slightly sweetened vanilla milk. Or keep it plain if you plan on using it for savory dishes.
Blend on high for 1-2 minutes until creamy and white. There is no need to strain it through a nut bag, like with almond milk.
Transfer cashew milk to glass jugs or other airtight container. It will keep for up to 4 days. It can also be frozen. Enjoy!
