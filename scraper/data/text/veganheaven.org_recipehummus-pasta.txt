Ingredients:
9 oz rotini pasta
2  cloves of garlic, minced
3 cups baby spinach
10  sun-dried tomatoes in oil
4 tablespoons hummus
2 tablespoons pine nuts
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste
1/2 cup fresh basil, chopped

Instructions:
Cook the pasta according to the instructions on the package. 
In the meantime, roast the pine nuts in a large pan without oil. Be careful as they burn rather quickly. 
Then, heat some oil in the same pan. Add the garlic and cook for about 2 minutes. 
Cut the sun-dried tomatoes into slices. Wash the baby spinach. Add both to the garlic and cook for another 2 minutes or until the spinach wilts. 
Add the cooked pasta. Stir in the hummus and season with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Sprinkle with chopped basil. Enjoy!
