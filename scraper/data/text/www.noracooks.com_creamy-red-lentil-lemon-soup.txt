Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium onion, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
3 large carrots, peeled and diced or sliced into rounds
3 ribs celery, chopped
2 cups red lentils
8 cups vegetable broth
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1/4 teaspoon turmeric
1/2 cup raw cashews
1/2 cup fresh lemon juice
3 cups baby spinach or chopped kale, optional
1/4 cup fresh parsley, optional for garnish
salt + black pepper, to taste
tiny pinch pinch cayenne pepper, optional for heat

Instructions:
Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onions, garlic, carrots and celery. Sauté, stirring frequently for about 5-6 minutes.
Add the red lentils, broth, cumin, coriander and turmeric and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, then lower heat to a simmer for 30 minutes, until the lentils are soft.
Place the cashews and lemon juice in a high powered blender, along with 2 cups of the soup. Blend on high until creamy and smooth.
Add the creamy blended mixture back to the pot and stir in the spinach/kale, if using. Cook for a few minutes until kale has softened, if using.  If you want a thinner soup, add 1/2-1 cup of water or more broth.
Taste and add salt/pepper and cayenne pepper. Serve immediately and enjoy!
Leftover soup will keep for 4-5 days in the refrigerator, and can also be frozen. It does thicken as it sits, so add a little water or broth when you reheat it. It&#039;s also good served with a scoop of rice.
