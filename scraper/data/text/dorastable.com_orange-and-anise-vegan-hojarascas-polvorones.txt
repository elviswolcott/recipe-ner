Ingredients:
5 oz. (2/3 cup) Sugar, granulated
12 oz. (1 ½ cups)  Vegan butter, room temperature
16 oz. (3 cups) Flour, all-purpose
1 tsp. Ground anise seed
1 tbsp. Orange zest
1 tsp. Vanilla extract
1 ¼ cups Cane sugar
1 tbsp. Freshly ground cinnamon

Instructions:
Preheat oven to 350F.
Cream butter and sugar, in an electric mixer with the paddle attachment.
Add vanilla, orange zest, and ground anise. Mix.
Slowly add flour, with mixer at low speed. Mix until well combined.
Line 2 sheet-pans with parchment paper. Roll out dough on a floured surface to ¼ inch thick and cut into desired shapes (you can also roll dough into 1 inch balls and bake them that way).
Place cut dough on sheet-tray, 1 inch apart from each other.
Bake for 15 minutes or until bottoms become golden brown.
Remove from oven. As soon as they are cool enough to handle, dust with cinnamon sugar.
Place on a wire rack to cool.
