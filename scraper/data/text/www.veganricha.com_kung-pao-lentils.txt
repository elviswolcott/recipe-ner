Ingredients:
1/2 cup dry brown lentils (washed and drained)
1 1/2 cups water
a generous pinch of salt
2-3 Tbsp soy sauce
2 Tbsp rice wine vinegar
1 Tbsp dry sherry or rice wine
1 tsp hoisin sauce (or use more soy sauce)
1 tsp toasted sesame oil
2-3 tsp raw sugar (or use 1 to 2 Tbsp maple syrup or other sweetener)
a generous dash of lime zest (1/4 tsp)
2 tsp cornstarch
3 Tbsp water
2 tsp grapeseed oil or other neutral oil
1/2 cup chopped white or red onion
4  dried red chilies like arbol or red chinese (broken into halfs (or use red pepper flakes to taste))
3 Tbsp cashews or peanuts
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 inch knob of ginger, minced
1  red bell pepper, chopped
1  green bell pepper, chopped
3/4 cup chopped celery
lemon juice and black pepper, for garnish

Instructions:
Cook the Lentils: Combine the lentils, water, and salt in a saucepan. Cover and bring to a boil over medium high heat, about 6 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and cook for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the lentils are tender to preference. Let the lentils sit for 5 minutes before using. Drain excess water if needed and keep aside. Or use 1 1/4 cup cooked lentils or beans.
Make the Sauce: Combine all the sauce ingredients into a bowl. Mix well to combine and keep aside.
Cook the Veggies: Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add onion and chilies and cook for 3 minutes. Add the cashews or peanuts and mix for a few seconds. Add garlic and ginger and mix in. Add the peppers and celery and mix well. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes.
Add in the sauce and cooked lentils and mix well. Add a few more tbsp water, if you like extra sauce. Reduce heat to low and cook for 3 to 4 minutes or until the sauce thickens and some is absorbed by the lentils. Taste and adjust spice and sweet. Add red pepper flakes to taste, if needed, and mix in. Garnish with a dash of lemon juice and black pepper. Serve with cooked rice or grains of choice.
