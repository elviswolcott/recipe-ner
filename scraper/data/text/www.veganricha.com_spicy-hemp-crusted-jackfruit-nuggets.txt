Ingredients:
20 oz can of young green jackfruit
1 cup water
1/2 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp old bay seasoning (or use garam masala + celery salt)
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp cayenne
1/2 cup non dairy milk
2 tbsp flax seed meal
1 tbsp starch such as corn or arrowroot
1/4 tsp garlic
1/4 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp old bay seasoning
1/4 tsp dried sage
1/3 cup hemp seeds  (or more almond meal or panko breadcrumbs (breadcrumbs make crispiest))
2 tbsp almond meal
1/2 to 1 tsp paprika
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 to 1/2 tsp cayenne
1/2 tsp garlic powder

Instructions:
Drain the jackfruit. Wrap in paper towel and squeeze lightly to remove excess brine. Slice into bite size slices. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F / 200c.
Combine jackfruit in a saucepan with water, garlic, garam masala, salt and cayenne and bring to a boil. Cook for 6 to 7 minutes. Total about 13 minutes. Drain, squeeze lightly and place on parchment lined baking sheet. Bake fo 10 minutes to dry out slightly. (this step adds flavor the the jackfruit bites).
Prepare your breading station. In a bowl, mix the non dairy milk, spices, flax and starch until smooth. Let it sit for 2 minutes.
In a shallow bowl combine the hemp breading and spices.
Take each jackfruit slice, dip in the milk mixture, then place in breading bowl. Move it around to cover all the surfaces, place on parchment lined baking tray. Repeat for all pieces. Spray oil on the pieces.
Bake for 15 to 20 minutes. Serve with your favorite cooling dipping sauce like vegan ranch.
