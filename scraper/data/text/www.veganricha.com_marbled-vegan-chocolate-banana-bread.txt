Ingredients:
1 scant cup mashed banana (Use scant cup, 2 large or 3 medium (if your bread tends to bake gummy use 3/4 cup))
1/3 cup sugar (such as light brown sugar or coconut sugar)
1/4 cup maple syrup
1 tsp vanilla extract  (or 1/2 tsp cinnamon or both)
2 tbsp oil (omit to make oil-free, add a tbsp of shredded coconut for additional moisture)
1/3 cup almond milk (or use other non dairy milk such as light coconut or soy )
1 tsp vinegar
1Â  3/4 cups all-purpose flour (I usually use 1 1/2 all-purpose and 1/4 cup of whole wheat or spelt or all 1 3/4 cup all purpose)
1/4 cup almond flour (, or use more flour for Nutfree )
1.5 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
3 tbsp cocoa powder
1/3 cup  boiling water
1/4  cups  vegan chocolate chips

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 365F (185 C) and line 9x5 inch pan with parchment.
In a bowl mix all the wet ingredients until well combined
In another bowl mix the flours, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix well.
Add 1 3/4 cup of the dry mixture to the wet ingredient bowl and mix it in. Add the rest of the dry flour mix 1 tbsp at a time, until batter is stiff like a muffin batter.
Divide the batter into two bowls.
For the chocolate layer, mix the cocoa in a small bowl with 3 tbsp of boiling water, mix this into the first bowl.
In the second bowl, add 1-2 tbsp of boiling water and mix in so that mixture is not that thick.
Now you can assemble the loaf as you like with whatever pattern. I usually alternate the batters and spread them out for a marble effect. Once all of the batter is finished, top with the mini chocolate chips.
Bake for 55-60 minutes. Check with a toothpick from the center of the loaf
Cool the loaf for 10 minutes before taking it out of the pan, cool completely before slicing.
