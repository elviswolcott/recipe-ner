Ingredients:
1 large head cauliflower
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium sweet onion, chopped
5  cloves garlic, minced
2 cups vegetable broth (I use Better than Bouillon)
1 teaspoon dried thyme
13.5 ounce can full fat coconut milk
salt and pepper, to taste

Instructions:
Prepare your cauliflower: Rinse the cauliflower, then remove the stem and outer leaves. Chop the cauliflower into florets. Set aside. You can also use pre-chopped or frozen cauliflower to make this recipe even easier!
In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook for 3-4 minutes until translucent, then add the garlic and cook for 1 more minute.
To the pot, add the cauliflower florets, vegetable broth, dried thyme and stir. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat, cover and simmer for about 15 minutes, until the cauliflower is tender.
Using an immersion blender (or transfer in batches to a blender), blend until smooth and creamy. You can also leave some texture if desired.
Stir in the coconut milk, to taste. I used almost the whole can and all of the white, creamy part. You can use more or less as desired for creaminess.
Add salt + pepper to taste, and serve hot.
