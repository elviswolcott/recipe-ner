Ingredients:
2  vegan puff pastry sheets (thawed)
5 to 6 oz baby spinach (thawed if frozen)
8 oz plain vegan cream cheese (, I use kite hill.)
1/2 tsp dried parsley
1/4 tsp dried thyme
1/4 tsp dried taragon
1/2 tsp dried dill
1 tsp onion flakes
3/4 tsp garlic powder
1/3 tsp salt (depends on the saltyness of the cream cheese)
a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg

Instructions:
Thaw the puff pastry if you havent already. Leave it on the counter till soft enough to handle.
Add spinach to a bowl. Pour boiling water and let sit for 3 minutes, then drain and use. If using frozen, thaw squeeze excess moisture and use.&nbsp;
Add the drained spinach to a bowl. Add cream cheese* (see note to make your own), herbs and spices. Mix well, taste and adjust flavor.&nbsp;
Place the 1 puff pastry sheet on the other and roll it out to a 12 by 14-16 inch rectangle. Spread the spinach mixture on rolled puff pastry evenly. Roll the puff pastry to make a roll. This roll will be soft at this point. Refrigerate to harden, about 1 hour. (at this point you can leave the roll refrigerated for upto a day, then slice and bake when needed)
Slice with a sharp knife or a serrated knife into 1/2 inch or less thickness. Place on parchment lined baking sheet and bake at 400 deg F for 25 to 30 mins or until golden. Cool for a few minutes before serving. Store on the counter for the day and refrigerated for upto 3 days.
