Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups unsweetened shredded coconut flakes
4 cups room temperature water
2 tablespoons pure maple syrup
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

Instructions:
To a high powered blender, add the shredded coconut flakes, room temperature water and optional maple syrup and vanilla. Blend on high for 1-2 minutes until creamy and white.
Strain the coconut milk through a nut milk bag, cheesecloth or thin tea towel over a large bowl.
Pour into containers and store in the refrigerator for 4-5 days. Separation is natural, so shake before using. It can also be frozen, if needed.
Use anywhere you would dairy milk, such as cereal or oatmeal. It&#039;s also a good substitute for store bought canned coconut milk, like in Tikka Masala or Thai Green Curry.
