Ingredients:
1 can of coconut milk
1/4 cup powdered sugar ((add more if you want it sweeter))

Instructions:
&nbsp;Chill a can of coconut milk in the fridge overnight.
On the next day, place your mixing bowl in the freezer for about 10 minutes before you start making the whipped cream.
Get your can of coconut milk out of the fridge. Be careful not to shake it.&nbsp;Carefully scoop out the hard part in your cooled mixing bowl and leave the watery part at the bottom of the can behind.
Use a hand mixer and whip the coconut cream until it's fluffy. Sweeten it with sweetener of choice (start by adding 1/4 cup of powdered sugar).
