Ingredients:
3/4 cup raw cashews (or pine nuts, walnuts, sunflower seeds)
3 cloves garlic
2 cups fresh basil, packed
4 tablespoons nutritional yeast
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup olive oil (omit for oil free)
1/4 cup water, plus more as needed
8 ounces uncooked pasta of choice

Instructions:
To a food processor, add the cashews, garlic, basil, nutritional yeast, lemon juice, salt, olive oil (if using) and 1/4 cup water. Process until smooth, adding more water as needed for a thinner consistency.Â If not using the oil, you will likely need an extra 1/4 cup water.
If serving with pasta, cook the noodles according to package instructions, then toss with the pesto, adding more water or olive oil as needed until it coats the noodles well.
Store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Pesto also freezes well for up to 6 months. I freeze it in an ice cube tray, then pop the cubes out and stick them in a ziplock freezer bag or container.
