Ingredients:
1/4 cup chocolate (chips, chopped bar, dark. I use enjoy life semi sweet or whole foods vegan)
2-3 Tablespoons raw sugar or other sweetener (depends on sweetness of the chocolate)
2 Tablespoons Coconut milk or non dairy milk/creamer (I used SoDelicious plain coconut milk,)
1 Tablespoon agave syrup
1/2 teaspoon coconut oil
1/2 cup coarsely ground almonds
1/2 cup + 1/4 cup coarsely crushed rice krispies
1 teaspoon lemon zest
a generous pinch of spices of choice (I am currently on a ginger and clove binge)
a generous pinch of salt

Instructions:
Keep all the dry ingredients ready, mix 1/2 cup almonds and 1/2 cup rice krispies, spices, salt and zest and keep aside. Keep additional 1/4 cup crushed rice krispies in a bowl too
In a pan, add the coconut milk, agave and sugar/sweetener and coconut oil.
Heat on low and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally.
Add the chocolate and mix continuously for a few seconds and switch off heat.
Keep stirring till all of it is melted into a nice flowy glaze.
Add the dry ingredients and mix well. Add more krispies if needed to make a stiff doughy mix.
Oil hands and pat this mix down on parchment into thickness desired. I made a 1/2 inch thick, 8 by 8 inch somewhat square.
Refrigerate for an hour, cut, eat!
