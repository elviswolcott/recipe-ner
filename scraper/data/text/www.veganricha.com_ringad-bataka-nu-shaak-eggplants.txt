Ingredients:
8  small brinjals/small eggplants (cut into 4 pieces each)
6  small potatoes (cut into 4 pieces each)
1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1/2 tsp mustard seeds
1/4 tsp hing (asafoetida)
1/4 tsp turmeric powder
1/2 tsp chilli powder or to taste
1 tsp cumin-coriander powder
1 tsp salt
2 tsp besan (chickpea flour)
1/2 Tbsp peanut or almond powder (a little coarse or ground sunflower seeds if you want to avoid nuts.)
1 Tbsp cilantro leaves

Instructions:
Heat up the oil on a medium flame and add the mustard seeds
Once the mustard seeds splutter, reduce the flame to low and then add in the hing, turmeric, chilli powder, coriander-cumin powder.
Mix well and cook for about a minute.
Add the potatoes and mix well so that all the potatoes are covered with the masalas/spices.
Add the brinjals/eggplants and mix well.
Add the salt and mix well.
Cover and cook on low flame for about 1/2 hr or till the potatoes are done. The brinjals will become soft so no need to check if they're done. Stir once in between.
Add the chickpea flour and the peanut powder and mix well. Cook for a minute.
Turn off the stove and add the cilantro.
Serve with Roti/Chapati/Puri Indian flat bread and Daal.
This can be used later on as a stuffing inside a grilled sandwich with some onions, bell peppers, and Daiya cheese!
