Ingredients:
1 tablespoon safflower oil
1  medium onion (minced or shredded)
1  carrot (finely chopped or shredded)
1  russet potato (finely chopped or shredded)
1/4 teaspoon celery salt
2 cups vegetable broth
16 oz frozen corn kernels
Salt and ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon liquid smoke
2 cups plain unsweetened almond milk
1/2 cup raw cashew pieces (soaked for 3 hours, then drained)
1  chipotle chile in adobo sauce (I added 2)
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
2 oz chopped pimientos, drained

Instructions:
Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion, carrot, and potato. Cover and cook for 4 minutes to soften. Stir in the celery salt, broth, corn, and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer, stir in the coriander, liquid smoke, and almond milk, and cook, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes.
While the soup is simmering, combine the drained cashews and chipotle in a blender with 1 cup of the simmering broth from the soup. Blend until smooth and creamy, then add 1 more cup of the soup and blend until smooth.
Stir the mixture back into the soup.
Taste and adjust the seasonings. Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with parsley and pimientos.
