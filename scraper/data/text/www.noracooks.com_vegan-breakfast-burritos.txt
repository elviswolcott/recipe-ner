Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
14 ounce block firm tofu
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
1/2 teaspoon salt, or more to taste
1/4 teaspoon turmeric
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
2 tablespoons unsweetened non-dairy milk
3 cups O&#039;Brien style frozen potatoes
salt + black pepper, to taste
15 ounce can black beans, drained and rinsed
3/4 cup shredded vegan cheese
4 large tortillas
1 cup pico de gallo or salsa
diced tomatoes
1 avocado, sliced or diced
hot sauce, chopped cilantro

Instructions:
Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Mash the block of tofu right in the pan, with a potato masher or a fork. You can also crumble it into the pan with your hands. Cook, stirring frequently, for 3-4 minutes until the water from the tofu is mostly gone.
Now add the nutritional yeast, salt, turmeric and garlic powder. Cook and stir constantly for about 5 minutes. Pour the non-dairy milk into the pan, and stir to mix.
Transfer the tofu scramble to a plate nearby. Scrape the pan clean as needed.
Pour another tablespoon of oil into the skillet and add the potatoes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 8 minutes until lightly browned and cooked through.
Turn off the heat and add the tofu scramble back to the skillet with the potatoes, as well as the drained and rinsed black beans and shredded vegan cheese. Stir to combine everything.
To assemble, place some of the mixture into the middle of a tortilla, then spoon some pico de gallo, avocado, hot sauce and/or chopped cilantro on top.
Wrap two sides of the tortilla inward, then roll the burrito up snuggly. Serve immediately.
