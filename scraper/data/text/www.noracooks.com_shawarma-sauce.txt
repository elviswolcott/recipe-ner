Ingredients:
3/4 cup plain yogurt (I used almond yogurt)
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon tahini (may omit if needed)
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill (or 1 tsp dried)
1/4 teaspoon salt

Instructions:
Add all ingredients to a bowl and whisk to combine. Keep in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
The sauce is perfect for Vegan Shawarma but also goes with falafel or any other Middle Eastern-inspired food such as kebabs or gyros.
