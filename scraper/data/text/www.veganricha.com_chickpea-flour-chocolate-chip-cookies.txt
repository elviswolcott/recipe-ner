Ingredients:
1 tbsp flaxseed meal
1.5 Tbsp water
2 tbsp maple syrup
1 tbsp molasses
1/3 cup sugar
1 to 1.5 tsp vanilla extract
1/3 cup oil (organic canola or safflower or extra virgin olive oil)
3/4 cup + 1 tbsp chickpea flour (garbanzo bean flour, or use Besan (gram flour) **)
1/2 tsp baking soda
2 Tbsp almond flour (ground almonds)
a good pinch of salt
1/3 to 1/2 cup vegan chocolate chips

Instructions:
Mix the flax seed meal and water and let it sit for 5 minutes.
Add the rest of the wet ingredients and mix until the mixture is well combined. It will take a minute for the oil to incorporate.
Add 3/4 cup flour and the rest of the dry ingredients and mix until the mixture is a stiff batter. Fold in the chocolate chips.Add as much chocolate as you like in chip or chunks or chopped.
Refrigerate for at least an hour to overnight to chill. Check the mixture, if the mixture is too sticky or batter like, fold in another 1 to 3 tsp chickpea flour. *
Line the sheet with parchment. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F / 180Âºc.
Scoop the mixture on the baking sheet. I use a big spoon for large cookies and shape it loosely into a 1.5 inch ball. Sprinkle some coarse salt for salted chocolate chip cookies. Place on baking sheet atleast 2 inches away from each other. Bake for 12 to 13 minutes or until the cookies have spread and are starting to turn golden on the edges. Bake a minute longer for crunchier cookies.
Take the sheet out and slam lightly it on the counter to release the excess air from the cookies. **
Cool for 10 minutes, then remove from the sheet. cool for another few minutes before serving. The cookies are softer when warm and get chewier as they cool.
