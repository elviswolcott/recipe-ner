1.5 cups sprouted chickpeas (1/2 heaping cup dry)
2-3 teaspoons organic canola or virgin olive oil
1/2 teaspoon turmeric
1/2 teaspoon red chili powder (or black pepper or cayenne to taste)
salt to taste (1/2 teaspoon)

To Sprout chickpeas. Soak dry white chickpeas overnight in 3 times the amount of water.
Drain, rinse and let sit damp for a day covered with a damp towel or light lid. Rinse every 6-8 hours. See Leanne's sprouting guide here.
Rinse the sprouted chickpeas and pat dry. Or use canned/cooked chickpeas, pat dry.
In a bowl, add the chickpeas, add the turmeric, chili, salt and mix. Add oil and mix to distribute.
Spread the chickpeas on parchment lined baking sheet.
Bake in pre-heated 325 degrees F for 35-45 minutes.
Turn the sheet at 25 minutes. Check after 35 minutes for doneness.
Take baking sheet out when almost done, since the chickpeas will continue to harden and dry once out. Err on the side of some underbaked, to avoid baking them into stones.
