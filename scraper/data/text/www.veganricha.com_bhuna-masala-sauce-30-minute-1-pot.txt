Ingredients:
1 tsp oil
1  medium onion (roughly chopped)
10 cloves of garlic
1 inch big knob of ginger
1  hot green chile
1 to 1.5 tsp paprika (or 5 to 7 kashmiri red chilies, soaked in warm water for 15 mins)
1 tsp ground cumin
2 tsp coriander powder
1/2 tsp or more garam masala
4  fenugreek seeds (optional)
1/2 tsp cayenne
1/4 tsp turmeric
1/4 tsp cinnamon
3  large tomatoes chopped
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp sugar
Additional spices to add for variations: Either or all of 1/4 tsp ground cloves (1/4 tsp black pepper, 1/4 tsp ground cardamom)

Instructions:
Blend all the ingredients except oil in a blender.
Heat oil in a saucepan or skillet over medium heat. Add the blended mixture to the saucepan and continue to cook stirring occasionally for 20 to 25 minutes.
The mixture will thicken, then start to darken. If the masala starts to burn, reduce heat to medium-low. The mixture will eventually start to leave the sides of the pan which is when it is done. See pictures above
Store the masala sauce in an airtight container refrigerated for upto a week or frozen for upto a month.
Alternate Method: Blend everything except tomatoes. Use a few tbsp of water if needed. Add the blended onion mixture to the saucepan with oil, and cook until the onion does not smell raw, stirring occasionally. 11 to 13 minutes. Then blend the tomatoes to a puree and add to the saucepan. Cook until the mixture is homogeneous and most of the watery puree has thickened. 10 to 15 minutes. Store.
