Ingredients:
9  large medjool dates soaked in hot water for 15 minutes
1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce
3/4 cup water or veggie broth
2 tsp or more rice vinegar
1 tsp molasses
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp onion powder
1/4 tsp or more cayenne
1 tsp or more grated ginger
1 tsp sesame oil
1 tbsp or more maple or coconut sugar if needed
8 oz tempeh (cubed and steamed, or use Tofu)
1/2  head of a small cauliflower chopped into small florets (or use broccoli)
1  loaded cup chopped butternut squash or other squash
toasted sesame seeds for garnish

Instructions:
Soak the dates if you haven't. Steam the tempeh for 10 minutes or boil for 10 minutes. Drain and keep aside.
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F / 220ºc. Chop up the squash and cauliflower. Spray oil on the veggies, place on parchment and bake at 425 degrees F / 220ºc for 15 to 20 minutes or al dente. Or you can steam the veggies, or boil with the tempeh until just about done.
Drain the dates and blend with the other sauce ingredients until smooth. Pour the sauce into a skillet over medium heat. Add tempeh, roasted cauliflower and butternut squash. Cover and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the sauce comes to a good boil. Carefully Taste and adjust sweet and salt in the sauce. If the sauce is not sweet enough, add maple or coconut sugar or other sweetener. Continue to simmer over low heat for a few minutes or until the vegetables are done to preference and the sauce has thickened. Take off heat and let it sit for 5 minutes before serving. The sauce will continue to thicken as it cools.
Serve over rice/ grains of choice with a garnish of toasted sesame seeds and green onions.
