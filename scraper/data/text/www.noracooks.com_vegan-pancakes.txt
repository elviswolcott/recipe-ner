Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all purpose flour (*see notes for options)
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons granulated sugar
1 cup soy milk (*or use almond, oat or coconut milk)
1/2 cup water
2 tablespoons canola oil (*may omit for oil free)

Instructions:
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar.&nbsp;
Pour the milk, water and oil into the bowl with the dry ingredients, and stir with a large spoon until just combined. A few lumps are okay; do not over mix or your pancakes won't be as fluffy.
Heat a large griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Grease the pan with vegan butter or coconut oil, and drop about 1/3 cup of the batter onto it. Cook until bubbles form, then flip and cook until golden brown on the other side, about 1-2 minutes. Repeat with all the remaining batter.
Serve with vegan butter, pure maple syrup and perhaps some fresh fruit.
