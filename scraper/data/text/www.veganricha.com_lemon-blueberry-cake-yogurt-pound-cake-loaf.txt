Ingredients:
1/2 cup non dairy yogurt (or use blended silken tofu or thick cashew cream or softened vegan cream cheese or vegan sour cream)
3/4 cup non dairy milk
3/4 cup or more unrefined sugar (preferably powdered)
1 tsp vanilla extract
3 tbsp oil
3 tbsp lemon juice
Zest of a lemon or lime
2 cups flour (I use 1 cup wheat or spelt flour, and 1 cup unbleached white)
1.5 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
3/4 cup blueberries tossed in 1 tbsp flour

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 365 degrees F / 180Âºc. Line a loaf pan with parchment.
Add all the wet ingredients in a bowl and whisk until the sugar is well combined. 1-2 mins
In another bowl, whisk all the dry ingredients except blueberries. Add dry to wet and mix until just combined. Reserve 1-2 tbsp blueberries. Fold in the rest of the blueberries into the batter..
Drop the batter into prepared pan. Distribute the remaining blueberries on top and press in lightly.
Bake for 55 to 60 minutes or until a toothpick from the center comes out clean.
Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan. Cool completely before slicing. Frost or ice if needed. A simple glaze of lemon zest + lemon juice + sugar icing works really well.
