Ingredients:
2 tablespoons pure maple syrup
2 tablespoons pumpkin puree
1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice mix
1/2 cup unsweetened non-dairy milk of choice (almond, soy, coconut, cashew)
1/2 cup strong brewed coffee, or 1-2 shots of espresso
Vegan Whipped Cream

Instructions:
In a small pot over medium heat, add the maple syrup and pumpkin puree. Stir, then add the pumpkin pie spice mix and the non-dairy milk. Warm, but do not bring to a boil.
Once warm, turn off the heat and add the coffee (or espresso shots) and stir. Taste for sweetness: Add more maple syrup for a sweeter drink; I found 2 tablespoons to be just right.
Pour into a mug and top with vegan whipped cream. Sprinkle a little more pumpkin pie spice mix on top if desired. Enjoy!
