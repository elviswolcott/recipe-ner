Ingredients:
1  recipe Easy pizza dough
or my white garlic crust
or any of my gluten free crusts
3 Tbsp hot sauce
1.5 Tbsp Sriracha hot sauce
2 tsp extra virgin olive oil
15 oz can chickpeas  (or 1.5 cups cooked chickpeas)
1/2 cup ground cashew
3/4 cup almond milk
2 tbsp flour  (or 1 Tbsp arrowroot starch)
2/3 tsp salt
1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil
a very generous dash of black pepper
2/3  of the white sauce from above
4 cloves of roasted garlic  (or 1 tsp garlic powder)
1/4 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp italian herb blend
1 Tbsp nutritional yeast flakes
1 tsp apple cider vinegar
1/3  of the white sauce from above
1/2 tsp ranch seasoning
1/2 tsp celery seeds
1/2 tsp apple cider vinegar

Instructions:
Make the pizza dough according to recipe. Use double the pizza dough recipe to make 2 pizzas.
Make the Buffalo chickpeas: Mix everything under buffalo chickpeas. Mash a few chickpeas and let sit and marinate while you prep the sauce.
Make the White sauce: Blend all the ingredients under white sauce base until well combined into a smooth sauce.
Make the White Garlic sauce: Take about a 2/3 part of the white sauce from above and add garlic sauce ingredients. Mix well. Taste and adjust and mix or blend.
Make the Celery Ranch: Add the ranch seasoning, celery and vinegar and mix and keep ready.
Shape the pizza dough to a 10 inch rounds with thick edges so the sauce does not flow off the pizza during baking. Brush olive oil on it. Drizzle enough garlic sauce on the dough to coat. Add spinach or greens or other veggies of choice.
Layer buffalo chickpeas on the greens. Drizzle some buffalo sauce from the marinade.
Drizzle a generous amount of celery ranch. Add vegan mozzarella cheese shreds (optional). Try any of my cheeses
Bake at pre-heated 425 degrees F / 220c for 14 minutes. Broil for a minute to crisp.
Drizzle any leftover garlic sauce or celery ranch before serving.
