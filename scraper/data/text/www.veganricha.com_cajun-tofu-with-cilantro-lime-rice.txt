Ingredients:
12 to 14 oz firm tofu
1.5 to 2 tbsp cajun spice blend (, see note)
1 tbsp lime juice
2 tspÂ  olive oil
1/4 to 1/2 tsp salt
1 cup long grain rice or basmati rice
1/2 tsp oil
2 cups water
1/2 tsp salt
1 tbsp or more lime juice
1/4 cup packed finely chopped cilantro
crunchy greens, chopped tomato or cucumber,  lime juice

Instructions:
Press the tofu (wrap in paper towel, then kitchen towel and place a couple of heavy books on it for 15 minutes or use a tofu press). Then slice into 1/4 inch thick slices. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
Mix the cajun spices with lime juice, olive oil and salt to make a paste. Rub the cajun paste on the tofu and let it chill for at least 15 mins (to an hour) to pick up the flavor.  * See Note.. Alternatively, toss the tofu (in cubes form) in olive oil, then toss in dry cajun spice blend + salt. (Drizzle lime juice later after baking).&nbsp;
Bake the Tofu at 350 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes. &nbsp;Cool for a few minutes, then slice and serve.
Meanwhile, make the cilantro lime rice: Wash and soak the rice for atleast 15 minutes. (I usually do this along with tofu pressing, so the rice and tofu are ready around the same time).&nbsp;
Drain the rice and add to the saucepan. Add salt, water, and oil if using and mix in. You can also add in a bay leaf.
Reduce heat to medium-low and cook covered for 18 to 20 minutes. Fluff the rice, mix in lime juice and half the cilantro. Taste and adjust carefully. Cover and let sit for 2 minutes. Garnish with more cilantro when serving.&nbsp;
Assemble crunchy greens or lettuce cilantro lime rice, sliced tofu, chopped tomato and a good drizzle of lime or lemon, salt and freshly ground pepper. Serve as a bowl or fill up warm tortillas for great tacos.&nbsp;
