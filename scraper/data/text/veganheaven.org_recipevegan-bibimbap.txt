Peel the carrots and the cucumber and grate. Slice the mushrooms and the radishes. Cut the green onions into rings. Cut the garlic into thin slices. 
Drain the tofu and pat it dry with paper towel. Cut the tofu into cubes. Roll the tofu cubes in corn starch. 
Heat the sesame oil in a large pan and fry the tofu for about 4 minutes. Add one teaspoon of soy sauce and cook for another minute. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of sesame seeds. Put aside.
In the same pan, cook the mushrooms on high heat for about 5 minutes. After 3 minutes add the garlic. Deglaze with one teaspoon of soy sauce. Set aside. Add some water in the pan (about 2 tablespoons), add the spinach, and put a lid on the pan. Cook for about 2 minutes or until the spinach wilts.
