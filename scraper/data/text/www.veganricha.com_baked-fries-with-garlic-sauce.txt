Ingredients:
2  large russet potatoes cut into thin wedges or fat match sticks
2 to 3 tsp starch like arrowroot or flour
1 tbsp oil
salt (pepper to taste)
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp or more dried oregano (or use fresh)
2 tsp oil
5 cloves of garlic (minced/finely chopped)
3 Tbsp hummus (or use cooked chickpeas + lemon juice)
3 Tbsp tahini
2 to 3 tsp lemon juice
1/2 tsp garlic powder
salt to taste (1/4 to 1/2 tsp)
1/2 tsp dried oregano
1/4 tsp or more dried dill or parsley
2 to 3 Tbsp water as needed to thin
1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley or oregano for garnish

Instructions:
Bake the fries: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F / 220Âºc. Chop the potatoes. Press a paper towel on the potatoes to absorb excess moisture if needed.
In a large bowl, add the chopped potatoes and toss in flour/starch. Then add oil and mix in. Sprinkle will salt, pepper, garlic, oregano and mix in.
Spread the potatoes on parchment lined baking sheet with atleast a 1/4 inch between them. *Parchment papers have oven safe temperature mentioned on them. Do not use parchment with temp rating lower than 425. Bake on a greased baking sheet instead.
Bake for 15 minutes. Turn the sheet around and bake for another 5 to 10 minutes or until golden/golden brown on most edges. do not over bake to too much brown as the potatoes get bitter when burnt. .
Meanwhile make the garlic tahini hummus sauce: In a small skillet heat oil over medium-low heat. Add chopped garlic and cook until translucent. Stir occasionally.
Blend the rest of the sauce ingredients and half of the cooked garlic until smooth. Taste and adjust salt, tang (lemon juice) and garlic.
To serve: Place a double layer of freshly baked fries in a serving container. Dress generously with garlic sauce. Sprinkle cooked garlic over the sauce. Garnish with chopped fresh oregano or parsley. Serve!
