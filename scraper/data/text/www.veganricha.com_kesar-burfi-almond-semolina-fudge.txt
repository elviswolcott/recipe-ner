Ingredients:
3/4 cup raw almonds soaked overnight
1/2 cup Semolina flour ( or fine Semolina fine Sooji, fine cream of wheat)
a pinch of sea salt or regular salt
2 Tablespoons Oil (I usually use 1 Tablespoon refined Coconut oil and 1 Tablespoon Earth balance butter or organic canola oil)
1/2 cup ground raw sugar (or coconut sugar or other sugar of choice. Use 2 Tablespoons more for sweeter)
1/4 cup water
a pinch of cardamom powder
1/2-1 teaspoon Saffron strands (to taste)
a pinch of salt

Instructions:
Soak the almonds overnight. Peel and pulse into coarse crumbs. Add a pinch of sea salt and keep ready. * You can also use almond meal. Soak for a few hours, drain and use.
* To peel almonds easily. Drain and soak them in boiling water for 2 minutes. The Skin will loosen up. Press the almonds and they will pop out.
In a pan, mix all the ingredients under sugar syrup and bring to a boil on low-medium heat. Continue boiling till 1 string (single thread)consistency is achieved ( temp around 230 degrees F / 110c).
Meanwhile, in another pan, dry roast the semolina on low-medium heat for 6-8 minutes or until it starts changing color and is fragrant. * If your semolina grain is large, then pulse it a few times in a blender/processor before roasting.
Add ground almonds, oil and mix well to form crumbs. (Mix continuously by pressing and breaking crumbs to evenly distribute the oil. half a minute)
Add the boiling sugar syrup and mix well.
Take off heat after a few seconds and pour on greased/oiled or parchment lined pan.
Even it out, use knife to cut into square or diamond shape, and let cool for 15 minutes before slicing into pieces.
