In 8x7 inch or similar size baking dish, add oil, and spread and add mushrooms, onions, thyme, and salt, and toss well. (Add in a few drops of liquid smoke or mix in some vegan bacon here if you wish ). then put it in the oven at 350 degrees F for 6-8 minutes.
Meanwhile, make your egg mix by blending all the ingredients from tofu up to water until smooth.
Remove the baking dish from the oven, then add in the bread, spinach, and peppers, and drizzle the egg sauce all over ,and lightly toss to coat. Even out with a spatula, and bake again for 25-30 minutes, or until the mixture is set in the middle.

Make the hollandaise : mix all the ingredients and 1/4 tsp kala namak in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk well to mix the flour. Cook until the mixture thickens evenly then take off heat. Add the remaining kala namak after 5 mins and mix in. Use sauce generously over the casserole
