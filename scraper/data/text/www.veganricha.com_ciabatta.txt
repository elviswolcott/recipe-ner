Ingredients:
1/4 teaspoon active yeast
1/3 cup warm water
1 cup bread flour
1 teaspoon yeast
1/3 cup warm milk ((nut or plant based))
1/2 cup water
2 cups bread flour
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons olive oil
oil for greasing

Instructions:
For the sponge, heat the water to a warm 110 degrees.
Add yeast to it and let stand for 10 minutes or until frothy.
Add bread flour and make a soft sticky dough. Keep this dough covered at room temperature for 12-15 hours.
For the bread, Warm the milk and add yeast to it.
Let stand for 10 minutes or until frothy.
Add the sponge, bread flour, salt and water and use a hand mixer to mix everything.
Let this dough rise in a warm oven for about an hour. (keep a damp towel over the dough)
Dough will be sticky and full of air bubbles. Turn dough out onto a well-floured work surface and cut in half.
Transfer each half to a parchment sheet and form into an irregular oval about 9 inches long. Dimple loaves with floured fingers and dust tops with flour.
Cover loaves with a damp kitchen towel. Let loaves rise at room temperature until almost doubled in bulk, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
Bake at 350 degrees F  for about 30 minutes or until golden.
In the first 10 minutes, spray water over the bread every 3 minutes, for a softer crust.
Cool on rack
Enjoy with soups and sandwiches!
