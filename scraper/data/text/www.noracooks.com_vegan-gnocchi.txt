Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2  vegan Italian sausages (7-8 ounces), sliced (I used Field Roast)
4 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup vegetable broth
13.5 ounce can full fat coconut milk
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning
1/3 cup sun dried tomatoes, sliced if whole
1 pound uncooked gnocchi (the dry packaged kind)
salt + pepper, to taste
2 cups loosely packed baby spinach
1/2 cup Vegan Parmesan, + more for garnish, optional (I used Violife)
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil

Instructions:
In a large skillet, saut√© the vegan sausage over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes, until browned.
Add the garlic and cook, stirring constantly, for 30 seconds until fragrant.
Pour in the vegetable broth, coconut milk, lemon juice, Italian seasoning, sun-dried tomatoes and gnocchi. Give everything a good stir.
Bring to a boil, then lower heat to medium and cook, uncovered for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Add salt + pepper to taste, and stir in the spinach. Cook for another 2 minutes, until the spinach has wilted.
If using, stir in the vegan parmesan. At this point, the gnocchi should be cooked through but not mushy, and the sauce thickened somewhat. Cook an additional minute or two if necessary.
Serve immediately garnished with vegan parmesan and fresh basil. Enjoy immediately for best results. Leftovers will keep in the refrigerator for 3-4 days. Add a little extra broth or water when re-heating, as the sauce will thicken as it cools. It can be frozen if needed.
