Ingredients:
3 Tbsp Sriracha sauce
 cup white vinegar
3 Tbsp hot sauce
2  tsp garlic powder
 - 1 tsp cayenne powder
 tsp salt
2  - 3 Tbsp sugar
 cup water
2 tsp cornstarch (or use potato starch )
12 to 14 oz pack of extra firm tofu (pressed for 15 mins then sliced into thin strips)
1 cup breadcrumbs
 tsp paprika
1/4 tsp black pepper
 tsp garlic powder
 tsp salt

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 400
Make the firecracker sauce, add all the ingredients in a shallow cooking pan. Heat the sauce over medium heat, whisk well to incorporate cornstarch and sugar until well combined
Bring the mixture to a boil, sauce will thicken slightly so keep whisking.  Simmer for 1 minute then switch off the heat, let the sauce cool to a warm state so that it  thickens a bit more
In the meantime, slice your tofu if you haven’t already and dip strips in the sauce using tongs, the coating on all sides.
Make your breadcrumb coating, mix well and place in a shallow bowl
Dip tofu slices from the sauce into the breadcrumb mixture, coating all sides again. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat for all tofu strips
Bake at 400 for 20-25 minutes or until crisp
Serve these strips with the remaining firecracker sauce on the side, or add all the strips to the firecracker pan and toss well to coat, using tongs to turn each piece to coat and cook together, serving immediately.
Serve with vegan ranch and top with thinly sliced green onions or scallions
