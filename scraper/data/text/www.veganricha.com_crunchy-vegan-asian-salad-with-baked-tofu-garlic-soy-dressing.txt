Ingredients:
1/4 cup soy sauce ( or tamari to make it gluten-free)
3 tbsp maple syrup
1/2 tsp garlic powder
2 cloves of garlic minced
1 tsp or more rice vinegar
1 tsp sesame oil
1/2 tsp red pepper flakes (less or more to heat preference)
a pinch of salt (pepper)
14 oz firm tofu
3 cups chopped crunchy greens  (such as romaine lettuce, baby spinach, arugula, Chinese cabbage etc)
1  cucumber thinly sliced
1 cup sliced or julienned carrot
1  red bell pepper juilenned
1 cup other veggies (thinly sliced or juilenned (optional))
chopped scallions (cilantro or mint for garnish)

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F / 200c. Mix the dressing ingredients in a bowl. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Press the tofu for atleast 5 minutes in a Tofu press or between paper towels. Cube the tofu and add to the bowl with the dressing. Let it sit for 5 minutes. Then strain the tofu out (slightly strained so there is some dressing but it isn't leaking the dressing everywhere), using a spoon or fork from the bowl and spread evenly on parchment lined sheet. Bake at 400 degrees f / 200c For 20 to 25 mins.
Chop up the veggies and greens and arrange in serving bowls. Add some salt and pepper if using hearty greens or veggies and mix in. Add baked tofu. Thin the remaining dressing in the bowl with 1 tbsp of water and mix in. Dress each serving liberally with the dressing. Drizzle some soy sauce for additional dressing if needed. Add chopped scallions, cilantro or mint. Garnish with pepper flakes (optional). Serve.
