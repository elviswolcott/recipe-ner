Ingredients:
7-8  strawberries
1  medium mango
8-10  mint leaves
2-3 cups water
2 Tablespoons raw sugar

1/4 teaspoon rock salt ((kala namak))
1/4 teaspoon cumin powder

Instructions:
In a pressure cooker or a deep pan, add strawberries, peeled chopped mango, mint leaves, salt, sugar, rock salt, cumin powder, and water enough to cover the fruit.
Pressure cook for 1 whistle, or boil for 15-20 minutes until mango is soft and cooked.
Blend the mixture when cool and adjust salt, sugar and rock salt(rock salt adds a nice sour taste).
Add more or less water according to preference. You can make this with raw fruits too!
