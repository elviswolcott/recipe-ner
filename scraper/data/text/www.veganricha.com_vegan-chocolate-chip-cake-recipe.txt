Ingredients:
1 cup non dairy milk (, such as almond or soy)
1 tbsp non dairy yogurt or applesauce or more non dairy milk
1 tsp apple cider vinegar (or other vinegar)
1/3 cup unrefined sugar (, use 1 tbsp more for sweeter)
1/4 cup oil (neutral such as organic safflower or canola) (or use 3 tbsp applesauce to make oil-free)
1 tsp vanilla extract
a few drops of almond extract (, optional but wonderful)
2 cups of flour ((I use a mix of unbleached all purpose(1.25 cups) and wheat(3/4 cup))
2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 cup vegan chocolate chips (, I like a mix of mini and regular size vegan chocolate chips/chunks/chopped up dark chocolate)

Instructions:
Line a 9 by 5 inch or smaller loaf pan with parchment or grease well. Preheat the oven to 360 deg F (182 deg C). In a bowl, mix in the wet ingredients until the sugar is fully combined.
In another bowl, whisk 1 3/4 cup flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Add spices of choice if you like. See GF option in Notes below. (Optional: Add 2 tbsp almond flour to the dry for additional texture). At this point you can also toss in seasonal berries of choice.
Fold the dry into the wet until just about combined. Add more flour if needed 1 tbsp at a time to make just slightly thick batter (you might not need any depending on the flours used).&nbsp;
Add 1/3 cup chocolate chips and mix in. Pour the batter into a prepared loaf pan. Sprinkle the remaining chocolate chips on top. or top with a streusel of choice.
Bake for 50 to 55 mins.&nbsp; Cool for 10 mins, then remove from pan. Cool completely before slicing. Store on the counter for upto 2 days, refrigerated for upto 7 days, freeze (slices) for upto a month. See Tips above for troubleshooting.
To make cupcakes/muffins: Bake for 22 to 24 mins for regular size muffinsBake in a brownie pan, bake for 40 mins.&nbsp;
