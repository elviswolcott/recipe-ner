2 cloves  garlic, minced
2 20 oz. cans young jackfruit in brine or water
1/2 teaspoon cumin
2 teaspoons paprika powder
1 pinch red pepper flakes, to taste (optional)
3/4 cup BBQ-sauce
1/2 teaspoon liquid smoke (optional, but recommended)
1/4 cup vegetable broth

4  vegan tortillas
2  tomatoes, chopped
1/2 cup corn

Instructions:
Drain and rinse the jackfruit. Remove the core and put it in a mixing bowl. Stir in the spices (paprika powder, cumin, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper). The jackfruit pieces should all be nicely covered.
In a medium pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Saut√© the onion for about 3 minutes or until it becomes translucent. Then add the garlic and cook for another minute.
Add the jackfruit and cook for about 3 minutes. Then add the BBQ sauce, the liquid smoke (if using), and the vegetable broth and cook for another 15- 20 minutes. Use a fork to shred the jackfruit.
In then meantime, make the vegan yogurt sauce. Put the soy yogurt (make sure it's unsweetened) in a small bowl and stir in the chopped parsley. Season with salt and pepper.
Serve the vegan jackfruit pulled pork on tortilla wraps together with the chopped tomatoes, lettuce, avocado, corn, red onions, and the yogurt sauce. Roll them up and enjoy!
