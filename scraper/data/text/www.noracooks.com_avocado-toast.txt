Ingredients:
2 slices bread
1/2-1  avocado
crushed red pepper flakes, to taste
salt + pepper, to taste
thin cucumber slices
ripe tomato slices
sprouts
arugula
everything bagel seasoning or chili lime seasoning
Vegan Parmesan
Tempeh Bacon

Instructions:
Toast your bread.
Cut the avocado in half, remove the pit and slice thinly (I do this with a knife right in the avocado shell). Scoop as much avocado as desired onto each slice of bread, and mash it with a fork right on the bread. Save a few slices for topping the mashed avocado, if desired.
Sprinkle with salt, pepper and red pepper flakes for simple and delicious avocado toast, or try with a combination of the optional toppings listed. Some good combinations are avocado + cucumber + tomatoes + sprouts + chili lime seasoning/everything bagel seasoning OR avocado + tomato + drizzle balsamic.
Devour and enjoy!
