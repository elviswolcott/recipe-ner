Ingredients:
1 cup flour ((I use unbleached white flour, See notes for gluten-free option))
3/4 tsp cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice
1.5 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 cup powdered sugar
3/4 cup oats
2/3 cup shredded coconut (, use 1/2 cup for less coconutty)
3/4 cup vegan chocolate chips (,I use a mix of regular and mini size)
1/2 cup light brown sugar
3 tbsp chopped pecans
1/4 cup + 1 tbsp applesauce
1/3 cup + 1 to 2 tbsp oil
1/2 tsp vanilla extract (optional)

Instructions:
In a bowl, mix the flour, cinnamon, baking powder, soda, salt and 1/4 cup sugar. Whisk well and set aside.
In a 4 cup(32 oz) mason jar, add the oats, then add coconut, tap to settle, then add chocolate chips, then 1/2 cup sugar. Tap to settle. Add the flour mixture. Tap a couple of times to settle, so that there is space for the pecans. Add the chopped pecans. Add as many as you can.
Close the lid. Add instructions and store.
