Ingredients:
15  Soft Medjool Dates *
3 tbsp sugar (unrefined, coconut or other for sweeter *)
1 cup water
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 tsp apple cider vinegar
2 tbsp oil
3/4 cup almond flour
1/4 cup oat flour (use certified glutenfree if needed), or use other flour such as sorghum, amaranth, or more almond flour)
1/3 cup white rice flour
1/4 cup potato starch
1.5 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 tsp spices such as cinnamon for additional flavor
1/2 cup non dairy milk
6  dates** (, add 2 tbsp sugar for sweeter)
1/2 tsp cornstarch or potato starch
2/3 cup vegan chocolate chips (I use half dark and half semi sweet)
a few drops of vanilla extract and a pinch of salt

Instructions:
Line two 6 inch pans with parchment or grease really well. Preheat the oven to 350 deg F 180 C
Blend the ingredients under wet until well combined and smooth. The dates should break down really well. Blend for 1 min, then rest for 5 mins then blend again for a min, 2 to 3 times
In a large bowl, add all the dry ingredients, whisk well.
Add the wet to the dry and mix to combine. If the mixture is too flowy, add a tbsp or so more flour.
Pour into pans, even it out, and bake for 25 to 28 mins. Check from the center of the pan. Cool for 5 mins, then remove from pan. Let cool completely under a light towel before frosting.
