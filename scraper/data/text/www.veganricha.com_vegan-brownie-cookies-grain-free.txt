Ingredients:
1.5 tbsp flaxmeal
1/4 cup plus 1 tbsp warm water
1/4 cup maple syrup
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/4 cupÂ  sugar such as light brown sugar (, coconut, cane sugar or other)
1/2 cup almond flour **
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
1/3 cup cocoa powder ((I like dutch processed(alkali processed cocoa powder but either will work))
1 tbsp tapioca starch (, or use cornstarch or all purpose flour)
3/4 cup almond butter or cashew butter ((scant cup))
1/4 to 1/3 cup finely chopped vegan chocolate or mini chocolate chips

Instructions:
Mix flax meal with 1/4 cup water in a large bowl set aside. Add the maple, vanilla, sugar to the bowl and mix well to combine the sugar.
Mix in almond flour, baking soda, salt, cocoa powder and tapioca starch if using, until well combined.
Mix in the almond or cashew butter and chocolate until well combined. Add 1 tbsp hot water and mix in.
Chill for an hour. Preheat to 375 F(190 C). Use a cookie or ice cream scoop to scoop out the dough onto a parchment lined baking sheet. Keep an inch around the scoops. Top with salt, flakes, sugar, candy cane, or cayenne for a mexican chocolate cookie
Bake for 12-14 mins (depending on scoop size and crispness level preferred). Cookie slam the sheet on the counter when you take it out so the cookies settle. this helps get a more cookie like dense texture.  Cool for 10 mins, then serve. Store: Cool completely and store on the counter, covered, for upto 4 days. Refrigerate for longer
** Depending on your nut butter used and preference of texture (for crispier), you might need to add 2 to 3 tbsp more almond flour. Chill again for half an hour and then bake
