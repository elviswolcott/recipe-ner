Ingredients:
1/2 cup almond flour
1/2 cup flour (, I use unbleached white. Use oat flour or gluten-free blend to make gluten-free)
1/4 tsp salt
1/3 tsp cinnamon
3.5 tbsp coconut sugar ( or use any fine grain sugar of choice)
2.5 to 3 tbsp oil (, organic safflower or other neutral)
1 1/4 cup sweet potato puree (, or use pure pumpkin puree)
1/4 cup maple syrup
5 tsp starch (, cornstarch or arrowroot starch)
1 tsp pumpkin pie spice (, or use 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ground ginger, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, a pinch of cloves)
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1/8 tsp salt
1 tbsp oil (, organic safflower or other neutral)

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a loaf pan with parchment such that the parchment strip is hanging over the edge (see pics). Make the Crust: Add all the ingredients except oil in a bowl and mix well. Add 2 tbsp of oil and mix in with a spoon or your hand. Add more oil a tsp at a time to mix in until the crust starts to stick to make fat crumbs.&nbsp;
Transfer mixture to the loaf pan (a stoneware or glass pan works better to keep the crust more shortbread like and reduce overbrowning). Press it down to form a well packed and even crust. Bake for 8 to 10 mins.
Mix everything under the sweet potato layer until well combined. Pour over the baked crust. Bake for 35 to 45 minutes until the top is well set.&nbsp;
Let it cool for 15 minutes, then gently remove from the pan. Chill for atleast an hour before slicing. Longer chilling time (a few hours) makes for a better set top and much more spiced and buttery flavor profile. Serve as is or with a dollop of vegan vanilla ice cream or whipped coconut cream and a dusting of pumpkin pie spice.
