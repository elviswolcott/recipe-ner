1/4 cup maple syrup
2 tbsp coconut sugar or other sugar for sweeter (, optional)
1 cup pumpkin puree
1 tsp vinegar

1 tbsp flax seed meal
1 cup almond flour
1/4 cup coconut flour
1 tbsp potato starch (or other starch such as tapioca or corn)

2.5 tbsp brown sugar (or use coconut sugar)
3/4 tsp cinnamon
2 tbsp almond flour or a combination of almond and coconut flours
1/8 tsp salt

Instructions:
Line a loaf pan (9 by 5 inch. Keep some parchment hanging over the side so that you can pick the baked bars out of the pan without overturning). Preheat the oven to 350 deg F ((180 C).Mix all the ingredients under wet until well combined.
Mix the dry ingredients in a bowl and add to the wet, Combine to make a thick batter.
Drop the batter into a parchment lined loaf pan and even it out using a spatula.
Mix the streusel ingredients. Add about 1 tsp or so maple syrup, or almond butter or pumpkin puree to moisten it to make crumbs if the brown sugar isn't moist enough.
Spread on top. Bake for 30 to 35 mins.
Cool for 10 mins in the pan. Then remove from the pan by lifting up the hanging parchment, cool completely, slice and chill for an hour or so before serving.
