Ingredients:
1 Tablespoon gf Oats (ground)
1 Tablespoon Almond (ground)
1.5 teaspoon cocoa powder. a half tsp more if you like it dark
1/8 teaspoon baking powder
1 tablespoon  raw sugar (ground(raw sugar is sweeter than white sugar))
1 teaspoon organic canola oil and a few drops for greasing
Spices of choice (I used a pinch of cloves, and ginger powder)
2 teaspoons SoDelicious plain coconut yogurt.
3/4 teaspoon orange marmalade
3/4 teaspoon hazelnut creamer. (I used SoDelicious Hazelnut creamer or Make your own thick nut milk and use it.)
Or You can use Hazelnut flour instead of Almond flour and non dairy yogurt.

Instructions:
Whisk all the dry ingredients very well. I used freshly ground oats and almonds.
Mix the oil and yogurt (or oil, marmalade and creamer)and whisk to remove lumps, add this to the dry ingredients and mix till well combined and like a muffin batter. If it is too dry, add a drop or 2 of yogurt or creamer. Try to not make the batter too wet.
Grease a ramekin well if you want to remove the cake and serve.
Drop this batter into a tiny ramekin or small thick ceramic espresso cup.
Microwave on high power for 40-50 seconds.(depends on the size of the ramekin. deep and tall will need more time)
Let it cool completely before trying to remove from ramekin. or cool for 5 minutes before digging in.
