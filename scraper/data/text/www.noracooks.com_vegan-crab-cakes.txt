Ingredients:
15 ounce can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
15 ounce can hearts of palm, drained and rinsed
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 large red bell pepper, seeded and finely diced
1/2 medium sweet onion, finely diced
3 tablespoons vegan mayo (I use Follow Your Heart brand)
1 teaspoon dijon mustard
1 tablespoon Old Bay Seasoning
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
3/4 cup panko breadcrumbs (check ingredients to ensure vegan)
1/4 cup fresh chopped dill or parsley
vegetable oil, for frying
1/2 cup vegan mayo
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon sweet pickle relish
salt + pepper, to taste

Instructions:
In a food processor, add the chickpeas and hearts of palm to a food processor. Pulse a few times until broken down a bit but not smooth. You want to leave a lot of texture.
Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and set aside.
In a small pan, saut√© the red bell pepper and onion over medium heat in a tablespoon of olive oil until translucent and softened, about 3-4 minutes.
Add the red bell pepper and onion to the bowl with the chickpeas/hearts of palm, along with the vegan mayo, dijon mustard, old bay seasoning, salt, black pepper, panko breadcrumbs and dill/parsley. Mix until well combined.
Form into about 8 patties, about 1/2 inch thick.
Heat a large pan (non stick or cast iron preferred) with a thin layer of oil. Fry the patties for about 4-5 minutes on each side, until golden brown.
Transfer cooked patties to a plate lined with paper towels or a clean dish towel to soak up the extra oil.
Lemon aioli: In a small bowl, whisk together the vegan mayo, lemon juice, sweet pickle relish and salt + pepper to taste.
Serve the vegan crab cakes with lemon aioli and enjoy! Leftovers will keep in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Reheat in a pan on the stove, the air fryer or oven to make them crispy again.
