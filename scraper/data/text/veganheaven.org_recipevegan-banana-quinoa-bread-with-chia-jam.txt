Ingredients:
1/2 cup uncooked quinoa
3  ripe bananas, mashed
2 tablespoons agave
1 cup whole wheat flour
2 tablespoons ground flax seeds
4 tablespoons water
3 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1 cup rolled oats
1/2 cup almonds, chopped
1/4 cup almond milk
2 cups frozen or fresh berries (I used frozen mixed berries (raspberries, blackberries, cherries, and strawberries))
3 tablespoons chia seeds

Instructions:
Cook the quinoa according to the instructions on the package.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees (180 C).
Place the grated flax seeds and the water in a small bowl and allow to thicken.
Combine the rest of the ingredients in a medium bowl. Stir in the flax seeds.
Grease a bread tin with vegan margarine and pour in the batter.
Bake for 60 minutes. Allow to cool down before removing it from the bread tin.
Meanwhile make the berry-chia jam: Place the frozen or fresh berries in a small sauce pan and bring to a simmer. Lightly mash the berries with a fork or a potato masher.  Make sure to leave some parts of the fruits intact. Stir in the chia seeds and cook for another 5-8 minutes until the mixture is thick enough.
Serve the banana-quinoa bread together with the berry-chia jam.
