Ingredients:
1/4 cup non-dairy milk (such as almond soy or light coconut)
1/4 cup  water
1/2 tsp vinegar (, white vinegar or apple cider vinegar )
2 tsp extra virgin olive oil
1 1/2 cup  flour (, I use unbleached all purpose )
1/3 tsp salt
1 tsp baking powder
1/8 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp oregano

Instructions:
Warm the water and non-dairy milk until lukewarm, mix in the extra virgin olive oil and vinegar
In another bowl mix in rest of the dried ingredients, until they are well combined
Add the dried ingredients to the wet bowl and mix
Press and mix or use your hands to lightly knead. Depending on the nondairy milk and the flour used, you might need a tsp or so more water to get the dough together. As soon as the dough forms, bring it together and cover the bowl and let it sit for half an hour.(15 Mins if near a warm oven)
Remove the dough from the bowl and spread it using a rolling pin or hands on a parchment lined baking sheet. use flour if dough is sticky to help spread. Use hands or roll it out.
Put your favorite pizza sauce on top, veggies and vegan cheese or other toppings of choice.
Bake at 425F (220C) for 16-18 minutes depending on the size of the pizza and thickness of the crust.
Broil for half a minute to brown if needed and then take the pizza out of the oven, let it sit for a minute and slice and serve.
