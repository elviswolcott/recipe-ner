Ingredients:
1 teaspoon active yeast
2 teaspoons raw sugar (2 Tablespoons for sweeter. The bread has just a hint of sweetness with 2 tsps.)
1/4 cup water
1/4 cup vanilla almond milk or few drops of vanilla extract + non dairy milk/water
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup bread flour
1 Tablespoon evoo or organic canola oil
1/3 teaspoon salt
1 Tablespoon instant coffee (skip for just chocolate layer)
3 Tablespoons cocoa powder

Instructions:
In 2 medium bowls, add 1/4 cup warm water, raw sugar and yeast. Mix and let sit until frothy(10 minutes).
Add the vanilla almond milk, oil to one bowl.
Add the flours and salt and knead 5-6 minutes in stand mixer or 8-9 minutes by hand. Cover and let rise for 1.5 hours or until doubled.
Mix the coffee, cocoa powder, almond milk, salt and oil well.
Add the flours and cocoa mixture to the yeast mixture in the other bowl and knead 5-6 minutes.
You might need a little flour more or less depending on the flours used.
Cover and let rise for 1.5 hours or until doubled.
Punch dough down, use a Tablespoon or so bread flour to help make the dough less sticky and knead for a few seconds.
Pat or roll out the vanilla dough into a rectangle.
Roll out the mocha layer and place over the vanilla. (You can sprinkle a layer of chocolate chips on the vanilla layer before topping with the mocha layer)
Roll up the layers like a tight jelly roll.
Seal the edges and place seam side down in a parchment lined bread pan.
Spray water on top. Top liberally with oats.
Cover with a towel and let rise until doubled(40-50 minutes)
Bake in reheated 365 degrees F for 30-35 minutes until a tap on the top sounds hollow.
Let cool completely before slicing or storing. (Refrigerate for half an hour before slicing for clean less crumbly slices)
