Ingredients:
1 Tablespoon organic canola oil
1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds
1/4 teaspoon fennel seeds (Optional)
1  green chili pepper chopped
8-10  curry leaves chopped
1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder
1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste
1 teaspoon raw sugar or powdered Jaggery (Optional)
1 cup loaded Puffed rice
1 cup loaded brown rice krispies
1/4 cup each of raisins, dried cranberries or other dried fruit
1/2 cup Roasted sprouted chickpeas  (or roasted sprouted red lentils or Nuts of choice)
2 Tablespoons dry watermelon seeds- Magaj (Or sunflower seeds)
2 Tablespoons sesame seeds
1/4 cup roasted chana dal-dalia (you can find this in indian store(Optional))

Instructions:
Heat the oil in a wide pan over medium high heat. Add mustard seeds when hot
As mustard seeds crackle, add green chili, and curry leaves. (Cover the pan immediately for few seconds to not get splattered by hot oil when you add the curry leaves) You can substitute finely chopped cilantro for curry leaves too. Let the cilantro become completely crisp before the next step.
Lower the heat to medium low.
Add raisins, cranberries (and nuts- about 1 cup, and chana daal, if using) and keep stirring for 30 seconds.
Add fennel seeds, Roasted chickpeas or lentils, watermelon/sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, salt and turmeric. Mix well for a few seconds.
Add the rise krispies, puffed rice. Mix well until the turmeric color is well distributed(about a minute).
Take off heat. Add sugar if using, a 1/4 tsp chili powder for spice, taste and adjust salt, mix well and let cool before serving or storing in an airtight container for a few weeks.
