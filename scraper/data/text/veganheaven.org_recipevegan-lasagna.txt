Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1  onion, chopped
2  cloves of garlic, minced
1  large carrot, cut into small pieces
2  stalks of celery, cut into small pieces
3/4 cup red lentils
3 tablespoons tomato paste
1/3 cup dry red wine  ((use a vegan brand))
2 cans diced tomatoes ((14.5 oz each))
2 cups vegetable broth
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 cup fresh basil, roughly chopped or torn
salt
black pepper
9  lasagna noodles
3/4 cup vegan sour cream
1 cup vegan cheese shreds

Instructions:
Cut the celery and the carrots into small pieces. 
In a large sauce pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Sauté the onion for about 2 minutes. Then add the garlic and cook it for another minute. 
Rinse the red lentils in a colander with cold water. Add the carrots and celery and cook for a further 3 minutes.
Stir in the red lentils and the tomato paste. 
After another minute, deglaze with red wine and allow to evaporate (this will take about 1 minute).
Add the diced tomatoes and vegetable broth and simmer for about 15-20 minutes until the sauce is thick and the lentils are fairly soft and good to eat (they shouldn’t be too soft).
Preheat your oven to 350 °F. Add a cup of the lentil bolognese sauce at the bottom of your casserole dish. 
Then add a layer of lasagna sheets, then again Bolognese sauce.
Top it with some vegan sour cream. 
Continue with two more layers of sauce and lasagna sheets. Put the rest of the bolognese sauce on top.
Sprinkle the lasagna with vegan cheese.
Bake the lasagna for 30-35 minutes, depending on your oven.
Enjoy the lasagna with a green side salad.
