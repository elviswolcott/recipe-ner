Ingredients:
1 cup ripe mango
6 oz vegan cream cheese (I use kite hill almond plain)
1 cup cashew milk (or use soy milk or almond milk or full fat coconut milk)
3 to 4 tbsp sugar (depends on ripeness of the mango)
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
a good pinch of salt
1 tsp arrowroot starch or cornstarch
1 tbsp refined coconut oil (optional)
1 tbsp brown sugar
1 tbsp almond flour
a pinch of salt
dash of cinnamon or cardamon

Instructions:
Blend everything and add to a saucepan. Bring to a gentle boil, stirring occasionally. This will enhance the mango flavor. Cook for another 2 to 3 mins.
Let it cool completely, then freeze in ice cream maker or popsicles or in a container.
The ice cream mixture can be frozen directly in a container, use cashew milk for best results. Freeze only until just about frozen. Let it sit for a few mins then scoop. For the Ice cream maker, chill completely and add to the ice cream maker to churn. When done churning, freeze for a few hours then scoop.
Mix the sprinkle ingredients in a bowl. Press and mix to make crumbles. Add a few drops of oil if needed.&nbsp;Sprinkle on the ice cream before serving. The sprinkle is optional.&nbsp;
