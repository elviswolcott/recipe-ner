Ingredients:
7 oz smoked tofu, cut into cubes
1  onion, chopped
3  cloves of garlic, chopped
1  red bell pepper, cut into medium-sized chunks
1 medium zucchini, cut into medium pieces
1/2 cup white wine
1 teaspoon paprika powder
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste
1/2 teaspoon saffron threads
1 1/2 cups cooked peas
10-15  black olives, cut into rings
about 8  sun-dried tomatoes in oil, cut into stripes
1 can artichoke hearts, drained and roughly chopped
1 1/2 cups bomba or arborio rice
3-5  cups vegetable broth (depending on what kind of rice you use, adjust if needed )
red pepper flakes, to taste
1 handfull fresh parsley, chopped
1  lemon slices, to serve

Instructions:
Heat some oil in a large pan and fry the smoked tofu cubes over medium heat until brown and crispy on all sides. Put aside.
Heat some more oil in the same pan and saut√© the onion and the garlic for about 2-3 minutes. Then add the red bell pepper and the zucchini and cook for another 3 minutes. Stir in the rice and cook about 2-3 more minutes.
Deglaze with white wine. Season with salt, pepper, and paprika powder. Dissolve the saffron in 2 tablespoons of warm water and add to the pealla.
Add the vegetable broth (I recommend starting with 3 cups) and cook for about 15-20 minutes or until the rice is tender and has absorbed all the liquid. If necessary add more vegetable broth.
Once the rice is tender, stir in the cooked peas, the sun-dried tomatoes, the olives, the smoked tofu, and the artichokes. Cook for about 2 minutes or until heated through. Sprinkle with fresh parsley and serve with lemon slices.
