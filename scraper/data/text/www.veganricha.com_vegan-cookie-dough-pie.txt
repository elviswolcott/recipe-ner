Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups oat flour (use certified gf if needed, or use any other regular flour)
a generous pinch of salt
1/3 cup coconut sugar  (or ground raw sugar)
2 Tbsp coconut oil  (or 1 Tbsp coconut milk)
1 Tbsp vanilla extract
1/3 cup or more maple syrup
1/3 cup or more mini chocolate chips  (or chopped dark chocolate)
10  dates or other sweetener
1 13.5 oz can coconut milk
2 to 3 tsp chia seeds
2 Tbsp oat flour
2 tsp vanilla extract
1 to 2 Tbsp raw sugar or other sweetener (optional)
2 Tbsp chocolate chips
2 Tbsp cacao nibs or shaved dark chocolate or both

Instructions:
Soak the dates for the filling in hot water.
Make the cookie dough crust. In a bowl, add oat flour, sugar, salt and oil and mix well. Add vanilla extract and maple syrup and mix. The dough will come together by pressing and mixing in 1 to 2 minutes. Add in the chocolate chips. Add more flour or maple as needed (sprinkle non dairy milk to help bind if needed). Use your hands to press the dough together if needed. Taste and adjust sweet. Add more sugar or oil to taste to the dough if it is too floury. Press the dough onto parchment lined or greased pie pan.
Make the filling: Drain and pit the dates and add to blender. Add coconut milk, chia seeds, oat flour, vanilla extract and blend. Blend 2 to 3 cycles. Taste and add more sugar if needed and blend again. Pour the mixture into the cookie dough crust.
Sprinkle with chocolate chips and cacoa nibs. Add small balls of leftover cookie dough(or make another small batch and use). Freeze for 2 hours. Slice and serve.
