Ingredients:
1  medium onion chopped
3  medium tomatoes chopped
1  Serrano chili peppers
1  can garbanzo beans
2 cups water
1 teaspoon salt or to taste
1/2 teaspoon cumin powder
1/2 teaspoon coriander powder
1/4 teaspoon turmeric
1/8 teaspoon asofetida ((hing))
3  cloves
1/2 inch cinnamon stick
2  bay leaves
2  cardamom pods
1 cup cut leaf spinach
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/2 cup cilantro leaves for garnish

Instructions:
Pressure cook drained garbanzo beans with 2 cups of water for 2-3 whistles or until soft enough so they get mashed really easily.
Take all the non powdered spices(bay leaf, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves) and crush them a bit using a mortar and pestle or pulse in grinder/blender.
In a large pan, heat the oil on medium heat. Add all the spices and roast them for 3-4 minutes until they start to give out an aroma.
Add in the chopped onions and cook on medium heat until the onions are golden brown.
Add in the tomatoes and mix well .
Add in the spinach and cooked garbanzo beans and salt and mix well.
Cook on medium low heat covered for 15-20 minutes with occasional stirring.
Garnish with fresh chopped cilantro leaves.
Serve hot and garnish with finely chopped onions and lemon juice and serve with Roti or Naan or buttered bread!
