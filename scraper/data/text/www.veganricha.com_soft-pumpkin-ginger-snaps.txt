Ingredients:
1/3 cup pumpkin puree ( (pure pumpkin puree, not pumpkin pie filling. Use a well filled 1/3 cup))
1/4 cup neutral oil
1 tbsp flax seed meal
1/2 tsp vanilla
2 tbsp molasses
1/2 cup sugar (( I usually use a mix of coconut and raw sugar))
1.5 to 2 tsp ginger bread spice blend
1 cup flour ((I use a mix of whole wheat and unbleached white), see notes for glutenfree)
1/2 cup almond flour  (, see note for nutfree)
3/4 tsp baking soda
3/4 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt

Instructions:
In a bowl mix all the wet ingredients until well combined. The sugar should mix in.
In another bowl add 3/4 cup of flour and rest of the dry ingredients and and mix well. Or use a sifter and add to that and sift everything into the wet bowl. Add rest of the flour 1 tbsp at a time to make a somewhat sticky dough. See Note *
Let sit for 10 to 15 minutes on the counter if cool (its pretty cold these days) or chill in the refrigerator. The dough will become easier to handle.&nbsp;
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Flour or oil your hands. Make balls (about 1 inch balls) of the dough and lightly press on the baking sheet to flatten.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 11 to 13 minutes. For crispier, bake 1 to 2 mins longer. The cookies will be soft when just baked. Cookie slam the sheet for better crackling and texture. Let them cool for 5 minutes on the sheet, then transfer to a plate. Store on t he counter covered for the day and refrigerate for upto 5 days.&nbsp;
