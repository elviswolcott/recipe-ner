Ingredients:
1/3 cup blueberries
2 tablespoons raw granulated turbinado sugar or other equivalent sweetener
1 teaspoon vegan butter
6-7  raw cashews broken into small pieces
3 tablespoons raisins
3 tablespoons Semolina ((cream of wheat))
2 tablespoons Oats
1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder
2-3 tablespoons water or almond milk

Instructions:
Blend and puree the blueberries with sugar and a Tablespoon of hot water till nicely pureed.
Add in the oats and blend again to get a thick paste.
In a pan, add the butter and heat on medium low heat till it melts.
Add in the cashew pieces and raisins and cook for 2 minutes till cashews start to turn golden.
Add in the semolina in the pan and roast for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally, on medium low heat.
Add in the cardamom powder and blueberry and oats puree and mix well stirring continuously.
If the mixture doesnt come together and is too dry, then add a little water or almond milk, Add some coarsely ground oats if too runny.
Take off the heat after 2-3 minutes of continuous stirring, when the mixture looks like a dough.
Let it sit and cool for 5 minutes.
Shape the mixture into small spheres or flats and serve! I got about 8 small inch rounds! Store in airtight container in the refrigerator for a few days.
