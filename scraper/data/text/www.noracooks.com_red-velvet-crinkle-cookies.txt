Ingredients:
5 tablespoons vegan butter, melted
1 cup granulated sugar
1 tablespoon ground flaxseeds
1/3 cup unsweetened soy milk
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
3/4 teaspoon vegan friendly red food coloring*
1 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup granulated sugar
3/4 cup  powdered sugar

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a large bowl, add the melted vegan butter and sugar. Stir with a wooden spoon until well combined and smooth. Add the ground flax seeds, soy milk, vanilla and red food coloring. Stir or whisk well to combine.
Sift in the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt using either a sifter or fine mesh strainer. Stir until combined with the wet ingredients and a soft dough is formed. 
Fill one small bowl with the granulated sugar and another with the powdered sugar. Using a cookie scoop (or spoon), scoop 1 1/2 tablespoon sized balls of dough. Roll the ball in the granulated sugar first, then in the powdered sugar very generously, covering all sides. The more powdered sugar, the prettier the cookies will be.
Place the balls onto the prepared baking sheet, about 2 inches apart so they have room to spread.
Bake in the center rack of the oven for 11-13 minutes until set and cracks have formed. They will appear slightly undercooked and soft, but will firm up as they cool.
Cool on the baking sheet for at least 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack. Store any extra cookies in an airtight container for 4-5 days. They can also be frozen. Enjoy!
