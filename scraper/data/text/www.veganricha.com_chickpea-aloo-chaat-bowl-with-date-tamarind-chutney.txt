Ingredients:
1/4 cup packed chopped mint
1/4 cup packed cilantro
1/2  hot green chili  (or use cayenne to taste)
1/4 tsp sugar
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp garlic powder
1 to 2 tsp lemon juice
water as needed
7 to 8  soft medjool dates
1 to 1.5 tsp tamarind paste
1 tsp sugar
1/3 tsp or more kala namak (Indian sulphur black salt or Chaat masala)
1/4 tsp ground cumin
1/4 tsp salt
1 tsp lemon juice
3 to 4 tbsp water
15 oz can chickpeas or 1.5 cups cooked (or 1.5 cups sprouted brown chickpeas)
2  potatoes (boiled and cubed into small cubes, or coarsely mashed)
Indian Papri/Mathri crackers  (or other crackers or chips like sweet potato tortilla chips)
1/2 cup finely chopped onions
1  medium tomato (finely chopped)
2 tsp or more chaat masala

Instructions:
Blend the mint chutney ingredients until coarsely blended. Taste and adjust salt and tang.
Soak the dates in hot water for 15 minutes. Drain and blend with the rest of the ingredients. Use water as needed to make a smooth paste. Taste and adjust sweet and tang. (For a stronger flavor profile, bring the chutney to a boil, cool and use.) If you dont have tamarind paste, add more lemon/lime juice and kala namak for a sweet and sour chutney.
Toss the chickpeas in 1/2 tsp chaat masala, 1/4 tsp ground cumin and 1/4 tsp cayenne.
Reserve 1 tbsp of mint cilantro chutney for garnish and add the rest to the potatoes and mix. Add 1/2 tsp chaat masala or 1/4 tsp kala namak and mix in. Taste and adjust salt and heat if needed. If using mashed potatoes, mix in the chutney in the mashed potatoes.
Add the chickpeas and potato to the bowl. Add chopped onions and tomatoes and crackers of choice and assemble as you like. Add chopped cucumber, apple or other veggies.
Drizzle the date tamarind chutney liberally and the remaining mint cilantro chutney. Sprinkle chaat masala, and some lemon juice. Serve.
Add sev if you like and arrange the mixture on the crackers to serve for a chaat style experience.
