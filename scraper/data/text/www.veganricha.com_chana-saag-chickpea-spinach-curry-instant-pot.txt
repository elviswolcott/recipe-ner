Ingredients:
3/4 cup dried chickpeas (soaked for atleast 4 hours in warm water)
1 tsp oil
1/2  medium onion (finely chopped)
1  hot green chile (finely chopped)
4-5 cloves of garlic (minced)
1 inch ginger (peeled and minced)
1/2 tsp each ground cumin (garam masala, paprika)
1 tsp ground coriander
15 oz can tomatoes  (or 2 large tomatoes diced)
1.5 cups water (,1 cup for less stewy dish)
3/4 tsp or more salt
2-3  packed cups chopped spinach (,chard or combination greens (8 to 12 oz), use amount to preference)
1 cup non dairy milk
1 tbsp or more lemon juice
cayenne and garam masala for garnish

Instructions:
Drain the soaked chickpeaas, wash well, drain and set aside.
Press Saute on the Instant pot. Let the pot get hot for 2 mins. Add oil and spread using a spatula.
Meanwhile. Mince and mix together or process the onion, ginger, garlic and hot chile. Add to the hot oil. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring frequently.
Add the spices(cumin garam masala, paprika, coriander) and mix in. Add the tomatoes and bring to a boil. Mash the larger pieces.
Add washed and drained chickpeas, salt and water. Close the lid and put the knob on sealing.
Pressure Cook for 25 to 30 minutes. I usually cook for 30 minutes to be on the safe side as older chickpeas take a bit longer to cook.
Quick release after 10 mins. Press saute. Fold in the greens and non dairy milk.. Taste and adjust salt. Cook for 2 to 4 mins to wilt the greens.&nbsp;
Add cayenne and lemon juice and mix in. Serve hot over rice or with roti or naan.
