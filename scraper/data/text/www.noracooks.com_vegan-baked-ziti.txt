Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups raw cashews
3/4 cup water
juice from 1 large lemon (2-3 tablespoons)
4 tablespoons nutritional yeast
1  garlic clove
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 pound ziti noodles (gluten free if needed)
25 ounces marinara sauce ( 1 jar)
2 1/2 cups vegan ground &quot;beef&quot; OR 2-3 sliced vegan sausages, optional
1 bag non-dairy mozzarella cheese shreds, optional for topping
Optional:  Vegan Parmesan

Instructions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly grease a 9 x 13 inch casserole dish.
Make the Cashew Cheese sauce: Soak the cashews in boiling hot water for at least 5 minutes. Drain the cashews and add them to a high powered blender along with the water, lemon juice, nutritional yeast, garlic, onion powder and salt. Blend until smooth, scraping the sides down as needed. Set aside.
Prepare pasta according to package instructions. You can cook the pasta while your cashews are soaking to save time. Drain the noodles and add to casserole dish.
Pour the marinara sauce and &quot;meat&quot;, if using, on top of the noodles and stir to combine.
Spoon the cashew cheese on top of noodle/sauce mixture and stir gently, leaving pockets of cheese intact.
Sprinkle with non-dairy mozzarella cheese shreds OR about 1/2 cup of Vegan Parmesan.
Bake, uncovered, for 25 minutes until hot throughout.
Serve immediately and enjoy!
