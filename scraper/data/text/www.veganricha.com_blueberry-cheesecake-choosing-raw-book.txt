Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups almonds
Pinch sea salt
2 cups pitted Medjool dates
3 cups cashews (soaked in water overnight and drained)
1/4 tsp  sea salt
2/3 cup  melted coconut oil
Seeds of 1 vanilla bean (or 2 teaspoons vanilla extract)
1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
1/2 cup agave nectar
2 cups blueberries
2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
2 tablespoons agave nectar or pure maple syrup

Instructions:
Place the almonds and sea salt in a food processor and grind roughly. Add the dates and process until the mixture is well processed and sticks together when you squeeze a bit in the palm of your hand. Press the mixture evenly into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan.
Use a high-speed blender or food processor (high-speed blender is preferable, but a food processor will work as well) to process all the filling ingredients thoroughly, until they are silky smooth. If youâ€™re working with a processor, you may need to stop often to scrape it down. Pour the mixture over the layer of crust and use an inverted knife to smooth it over. Place the cheesecake in the freezer for an hour, then transfer it to the fridge and let it set overnight.
When the cheesecake has set, blend 1 cup of blueberries, the lemon, and the agave nectar in a blender until smooth. Transfer to a small bowl and stir in the remaining whole blueberries. Pour the mixture over the cheesecake (or you can spoon it over individual slices). Serve.
Cover and store the cheesecake in the fridge for up to 3 days, or in the freezer for up to 10. If you freeze the cake, defrost the slices in the fridge for several hours before serving.
