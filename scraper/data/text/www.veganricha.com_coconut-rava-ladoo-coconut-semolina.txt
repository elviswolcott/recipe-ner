Ingredients:
1/2 cup Semolina flour (or Brown rice flour for Glutenfree)
1/2 cup Coconut flakes (dried)
1 Tablespoon Coconut oil (optional. Omit to make Oilfree)
2 Tablespoons chopped cashew pieces (optional. Omit to make nutfree)
a pinch of salt
1/2 cup ground raw sugar (or use jaggery powder)
3 Tablespoons water
1/8-1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder (depends on how much you love cardamom:)

Instructions:
In a large pan, dry roast the semolina on medium-low heat for 6-8 minutes until the color changes and it gets fragrant.
Using a blender/processor, blend the coconut flakes to make coarse coconut flour.
Add the blended coconut, coconut oil, salt and cashew pieces to the pan. Mix well and roast for 2 minutes.
(Coconut oil and cashew pieces can be left out to make nut free and oilfree)
Meanwhile, in another pan, make the sugar syrup.
Add all syrup ingredients and bring to a boil over medium heat. Continue to cook at medium low until one thread consistency- 230 to 235 degrees F / 110Âºc.(a few minutes).
Add the hot sugar syrup to the roasting dry ingredients and mix well to form a lumpy mixture. (Best results when both contents are hot)
Take off heat. Cool for 2-3 minutes and form balls - Ladoo. Spray a little water if the mixture is too crumbly.
Or Press immediately into parchment lined or greased baking pan to make Burfi. (I used an 8 by 4 inch pan.) The mixture gets too crumbly as it cools. So shape when still warm-hot. Handle carefully.
Cut into squares when still warm. The bars will harden as they cool.
Break into pieces when cool. Store in airtight container for upto a week.
