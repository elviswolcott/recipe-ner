Ingredients:
1.75 cups  flour ((I use a mix of 3/4 cup wheat and 1 cup all purpose), See GF option in Notes below)
1/2 cup coconut sugar (, or other fine sugar, add 2 tbsp more for sweeter)
1 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp pumpkin pie spice
2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1 cup fresh cranberries or mixed berries
3/4  scant cup sweet potato puree ((I use canned puree), or use well mashed boiled or steamed sweet potato)
3/4 cup non dairy milk
1 tsp lime juice or apple cider vinegar
3 tbsp oil or omit

Instructions:
Preheat your oven to 365F (185°C). Line a loaf pan with baking paper and set aside.&nbsp;
Whisk 1.5 cups flour with the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl.&nbsp;Add berries and mix.
Mix vinegar into the non-dairy milk. then add it to the dry ingredients. Add sweet potato puree and oil and mix well to combine into a smooth batter. If the batter is too thin then add more flour a few tbsp at a time. (If you are baking muffins, you can keep the batter less stiff. For loafs or larger volume baking, you want the batter to be thicker, stiff with a more dry to moist ratio ad the sweet potato puree will leak moisture during baking.)**
Spoon the sweet potato bread dough into your prepared loaf pan. (Add a streusel&nbsp;if you like. )
Bake at 365 deg F (185 C) for 55 to 60 mins. (25 mins for muffins). Check with a toothpick from the center. Cool for 10 mins then remove from pan and cool completely before slicing.&nbsp;Store on the counter for the day and refrigerated for upto a 5 days.
