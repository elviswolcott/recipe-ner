Ingredients:
1/2 cup red lentils
1 cup of water
2 cloves of garlic
2 Tablespoons sesame seeds or tahini
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon paprika or cayenne or to taste
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
1-2 Tablespoons extra virgin olive oil.
2/3 teaspoon salt or to taste

Instructions:
Soak 1/2 cup red lentils for half an hour(You can skip soaking since red lentils do cook quite quickly). Drain the water
Cook in about 1 cup of water covered pan for 15 minutes on low-medium or 1 pressure cooker whistle.
The lentils should be tender but not entirely mashed, Add 2 cloves of garlic to the hot lentils and let sit to cool a bit. (the garlic will loose some of the raw smell this way if you dont like the raw garlic)
Add the cooked lentils and other ingredients to a blender.&nbsp; Blend until smooth
