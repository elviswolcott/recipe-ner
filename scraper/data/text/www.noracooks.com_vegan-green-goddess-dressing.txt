Ingredients:
1 1/2  cups raw cashews
3/4 cup water
3 tablespoons fresh lime juice
1 tablespoon pure maple syrup
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup cilantro, lightly packed
1/2 cup parsley, lightly packed
2  green onions, chopped

Instructions:
You will need a high powered blender such as a Vitamix for best results. First, soak the cashews in very hot water for at least 5 minutes, longer if desired. I do this by boiling water in my tea kettle and pouring it over the cashews in a bowl or measuring cup.
Drain and rinse the soaked cashews, then add them to your blender, along with the water, lime juice, maple syrup and salt. Blend until very smooth.
Add the fresh herbs and onions to the blender and pulse or blend to combine. I prefer to pulse it so you can still see some tiny flakes of the herbs, but you could blend it until very smooth as well.
You can serve immediately, or refrigerate for up to 5 days. It may thicken a bit in the refrigerator, so thin it with water if desired. The dressing is perfect on salads, and also a good dip for vegetables. Or drizzle over roasted vegetables. Enjoy!
