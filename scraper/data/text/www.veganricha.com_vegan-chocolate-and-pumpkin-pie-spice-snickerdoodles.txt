Ingredients:
3/4 cup almond flour
1/2 cup oat flour (Certified gluten-free if needed)
1 tbsp tapioca or cornstarch
1.5 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
1 tsp pumpkin pie spice (or use chai spice or cinnamon)
1 tbsp oil
1/3 cup maple syrup
1 tbsp cocoa powder
1 tbsp brown sugar (or coconut sugar)
1/2 tsp cinnamon

Instructions:
In a bowl, mix all the dry ingreients for the cookies until well combined.
Add the oil and 1/4 cup of maple syrup and mix well. Add the rest of the 1 tbsp maple syrup, and mix until the dough is a sticky mixture.
Divide the dough into two bowls. In one of the bowls, add the cocoa powder and mix well. Add a few drops of water, and a tsp or so more of maple syrup to make a sticky dough. The dough should be soft and sticky, and not stiff. Refrigerate for 15-20 minutes so that the dough is easier to handle. You&#039;ll want to refrigerate the dough for at least 20-30 minutes if the dough is too sticky.
In a small bowl, mix your cinnamon sugar mixture if using.
Take the dough mixture out of the fridge. Wet your hands take a tbsp of each of the dough and combine them to make one ball. Repeat until you have at least 9 or 10 balls. Coat one side of the ball with cinnamon sugar mixture, and place on a parchment lined baking sheet.
Press a fork to press the ball down. Press it down to a pretty thin cookie. Then bake at 350 degrees F (180c) for 13-14 minutes.
Remove the sheet from the oven, let the cookies cool for 2 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack.
These cookies can be stored on the counter for up to 2 weeks.
