Ingredients:
12 ounces elbow noodles
1 1/2 cups raw cashews
2 cups water
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1/3 cup nutritional yeast
1  clove garlic
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 cups panko breadcrumbs
4 tablespoons melted vegan butter
1/4 teaspoon paprika

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and lightly grease a large casserole dish (I used a 9 x 13 inch dish).
Soak cashews: Bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Pour the hot water over the cashews and let soak for 5 minutes.
Make the cheese sauce: Drain the cashews and discard the soaking water. Add them to a blender along with 2 cups of fresh water, lemon juice, nutritional yeast, garlic clove, onion powder and salt. Blend until very smooth, and set aside. It will appear a bit watery, but that is right as it thickens while it bakes.
Cook the pasta according to package instructions, but one minute less. The noodles will continue to cook in the oven, so do not overcook. Drain and set aside.
Make the breadcrumb topping: In a small bowl, mix together the breadcrumbs, melted vegan butter and paprika.
Add the drained pasta to the casserole dish. Pour the cheese sauce on top of the noodles and stir to combine. Sprinkle the breadcrumb mixture on top and bake, uncovered, for about 15-20 minutes until warm and golden brown.
Serve hot and enjoy!
