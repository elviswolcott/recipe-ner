Ingredients:
1 cup Almonds (soaked overnight, peeled)
½ cup Almond milk (unsweetened)
1 tsp. Vanilla extract
1 tsp. Lemon juice, fresh
¼ cup Agave syrup
1/3-1/2 cup Water
1 lb. Strawberries (hulled and cut into quarters)

Instructions:
To make the almond crema pour boiling water over almonds and let them soak overnight. The next day peel the almonds. Place an almond between your thumb and your forefinger and press slightly. The skin should slip right off.
Place almond in a blender with almond milk, vanilla, lemon juice, agave, and 1/3 cup of water.
Process until smooth on high. This is going to take 3-4 minutes. If necessary add the remaining amount of water until you reach the desired consistency. About the same as a thick heavy cream.
Strain the almond mixture with a fine-mesh strainer. Place in the fridge for at least thirty minutes.
Serve over cut strawberries.
