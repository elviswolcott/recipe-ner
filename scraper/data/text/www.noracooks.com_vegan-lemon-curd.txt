Ingredients:
1 cup unsweetened almond or coconut milk
1/2 cup fresh squeezed lemon juice
1 tablespoon lemon zest
1 cup granulated sugar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons vegan butter
1/4 teaspoon  turmeric or few drops of yellow food coloring, optional
tiny pinch of salt, optional

Instructions:
Add all ingredients to a small pot and warm over medium heat, whisking frequently until the mixture thickens. It will take 5-10 minutes.
It will still be quite thin and runny when warm, which is perfectly fine and you can serve it immediately if desired. For a thicker curd, refrigerate it for a few hours or overnight. Makes about 2 cups.
Serve over biscuits, scones, pancakes, waffles, french toast, regular toast, english muffins, in crepes or as a layer in lemon cake. Enjoy!
