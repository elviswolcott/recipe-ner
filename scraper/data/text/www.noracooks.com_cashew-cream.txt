Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups raw cashews
1 cup water
3/4 teaspoon salt
1-2 cloves garlic
optional: Sriracha hot sauce (1-2 teaspoons), nutritional yeast (1/4 cup, for cheesy flavor)
3 tablespoons pure maple syrup
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract

Instructions:
Soak the cashews: Bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Pour the hot water over the cashews and let soak for 5 minutes.
Blend: Drain the cashews, discard the soaking water and add toÂ high powered blender along with 1 cup fresh water. Blend until very smooth, scraping down the sides of the blender as needed. For savory cream, add salt, garlic and optional Sriracha or nutritional yeast. For sweet cream, add maple syrup and vanilla.
For coffee creamer, use the sweet version (maple syrup + vanilla) and add an additional 1/2 cup of water.
Store cashew cream in the refrigerator for 5-6 days. You can also freeze cashew cream, simply re-blend or whisk well once it thaws.
