Ingredients:
1  small head of cauliflower or 1/2 a large head
1/2  small onion
4 cloves of garlic (4 small cloves or 2 large)
1/2  red bell pepper ((or use roasted red bell pepper for variation))
1.5 cup water (or veggie broth)
1/2 tsp smoked paprika
1/4 to 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
a good dash of all spice or cinnamon ((optional, but adds great depth of flavor))
1/2 tsp dried thyme
3/4 tsp salt
1 tbsp nutritional yeast
1 cup cashew milk ( 1/3 cup cashews  (and 1 tsp flourÂ blended with 1 cup of water (use rice flour for gluten-free)))
basil/cilantro, vegan bacon, (black pepper and other toppings of choice)

Instructions:
Blend the first 4 ingredients with 1.5 cups of water or broth. **(see note). Add to the instant pot.&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively**, saute the onion and garlic&nbsp; in 1 tsp oil until translucent. Then add blended cauliflower Or add florets, chopped bell pepper and broth and proceed. Use an immersion blender at step 3 after adding cashew milk.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Add the spices, herbs, salt and nutritional yeast, Mix well. Close the lid and pressure cook (manual hi) for 14 mins.&nbsp;
Let the pressure release naturally. Open the lid, add cashew milk and mix in. Press Saute, cover and cook for for 4 -5 mins (The soup will tend to splash when boiling, so cover with a well fitting lid. If the lid is too large, the moisture will trickle out and flow along the pot to the bottom which is electrical, which isn't a good thing).
Taste and adjust salt, flavor, spice. Add some chili blend, or sweetener if needed. Add some more broth if needed for preferred consistency.
Serve with toppings of choice such as fresh basil or cilantro, vegan bacon crumbles, bbq chips,&nbsp;roasted cajun cauliflower! or other and a side of garlic bread or toasted+buttered bread or dinner rolls. So good!
