Ingredients:
3 cups rolled oats
1 cup chopped almonds
1 cup chopped cashews
1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup pure maple syrup
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/4 cup avocado oil OR melted coconut oil
1/2 cup dried cranberries, blueberries, cherries or raisins
1/2 cup vegan chocolate chips
1/2 cup coconut flakes or coconut chips

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a large bowl, combine the oats, almonds, cashews, brown sugar, cinnamon and salt until mixed.
Now pour in the maple syrup, vanilla and oil. Mix with a large wooden spoon until well combined.
Add the granola mixture to the parchment lined pan and spread into an even layer. It should all be touching, especially if you want big granola chunks.
Bake for 12 minutes, then stir the granola. Press it down evenly with a spatula, then bake for 12-15 more minutes, until lightly golden brown.
Let the granola cool in the pan for an hour, and don&#39;t touch it or stir it at all.
Once it&#39;s been at least an hour, add the dried fruit and optional chocolate chips/coconut and break the cooled granola into large or small pieces with your hands or a spoon.
Store in an airtight container at room temperature for 1-2 weeks or freeze in a freezer safe container.
Enjoy as a snack, on top of noon-dairy yogurt with fruit or in a bowl with your favorite non-dairy milk.
