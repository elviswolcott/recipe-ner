Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1  block firm tofu (7 oz), crumbled
1  onion, chopped
2  cloves of garlic, minced
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1/3 cup dry red wine
1 1/2 cups diced tomatoes (canned)
1 cup kidney beans
1 cup black beans
1 cup corn
1  red bell pepper, cut into medium pieces
1 teaspoon paprika powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
red pepper flakes, to taste
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste
1 cup cashews, soaked for 30 minutes
1/4 cup  fresh lemon juice
1  clove of garlic
salt
pepper

Instructions:
Either use a fork to mash the tofu or use your hands until it's all crumbled in small chunks. In a large pan, heat the olive oil and cook the tofu for about 5 minutes.
Add the onion and saut√© for about 3 minutes. Then add the garlic and cook for another minute.
Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes. Then deglaze it with red wine and allow the sauce to thicken for about 2 minutes. Stir in the diced tomatoes, the red bell pepper, the corn, the beans, and the spices and cook for about 10 minutes.
In the meantime, make the sour cream: Drain the cashews and put all ingredients in a food processor and process until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.
Serve the tofu chili with nachos and top it off with some of the cashew sour cream and avocado.
