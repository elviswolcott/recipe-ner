Ingredients:
1.5 cups black eyed peas (canned, cooked or sprouted)
1/4 cup Oats
1/4 cup chopped Mint
1/2 cup chopped Collard greens or other greens
1-2 Tablespoon melted 70% cacao chocolate (skip if you dont like the chocolatey bitterness)
2 Tablespoons organic oil of choice (I used 1 Tbsp virgin coconut and 1 Tbp extra virgin olive oil)
1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste
3-4 cloves of garlic
1/2 teaspoon garam masala or to taste
1  dried red chili or to taste or skip
1/2 cup small cauliflower florets
Grape tomatoes
Chopped Mint
1  medium tomato
1/4-1/3 cup Blackberries
1 inch ginger chopped
1  green chili
1 teaspoon oil
salt to taste
3 Tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 Tablespoon 70% cacao chocolate or any bittersweet chocolate
Chopped Spinach, Blackberries and Mint

Instructions:
Start up the oven to preheat to 425 degrees F.
Pulse all ingredients for the crust until a thick doughy batter is formed. Use a Tablespoon or so water if needed.
Spread the thick batter on parchment lined sheet using circular motion to about a 1/4 inch thick.
Bake for 6-7 minutes.
Meanwhile, make the Chutney sauce. In a pan, add oil, heat on medium high.
Add ginger and chili, Mix for a few seconds.
Add chopped tomato and blackberries, salt to taste.
Cook for 3 minutes. Stir every few seconds.
Add the cauliflower, toss and cover and cook till 2 minutes.
Take the crust out. Top it with the cauliflower and the thick chutney.
Add halved grape tomatoes and other veggies of choice.
Bake for 20-25 minutes. Garnish with freshly chopped mint and chili flakes before serving.
Meanwhile, prep the salad. Chop up greens(I used Spinach), add Blackberries and mint.
In a small pan, heat the balsamic vinegar on low. As soon as it starts to bubble a little, take off heat.
Add chocolate and mix well.
Let this mix cool for a few seconds and then top the salad with the dressing.
If you like the dressing, then sprinkle some on the pizza as well!:) Serve.
