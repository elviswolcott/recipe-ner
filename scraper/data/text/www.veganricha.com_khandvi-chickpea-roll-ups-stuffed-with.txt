Ingredients:
1/4 cup chickpea flour
2 Tablespoons So Delicious plain Greek yogurt + 1/2 cup water
a generous pinch of Asafoetida (hing)
1/2 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste
1/4 teaspoon green chili paste or chili/cayenne powder
1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder
1/3 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon organic canola or virgin coconut oil
2 teaspoons organic canola or virgin coconut oil
1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds
1 Tablespoon shredded coconut (optional)
1 Tablespoon Cilantro finely chopped
a generous pinch asafoetida (hing)
1  green chili finely chopped or to taste
2-3 Tablespoons Finely Chopped Kale and Cilantro

Instructions:
Mix all the batter ingredients, except oil to make a lump free batter. Blend it using a hand blender or a regular blender if needed.
Heat a teaspoon of oil in a medium pan, Add the batter and cook on low heat.
Stir continuously and evenly to avoid lumps. Cook till the mixture does not taste raw and thickens to slight gel like consistency. (4-6 minutes depending on the pan)
Drop the mixture immediately on aluminium foil and spread as thin as possible with a spatula.( 2 to 3 mm thick). Video of authentic(non-vegan) Khandvi here to get an idea of how the batter behaves.
After it has completely cooled( 10 minutes), cut into 1.5 -2 inch wide strips.
Oil your hands, lift one side carefully and Roll each strip into rolls, like a fruit roll up. Place some soft finely chopped Kale leaves or spinach, cilantro, or chutneys on the strip before rolling for a stuffed roll up. Place each roll up on a serving plate. You can refrigerate these for a day or 2 and temer right before serving.
For the tempering, Heat oil in a small pan. Add mustard seeds, and allow them to start popping.
Add asafoetida, and chili and cook for 15 seconds.
Pour over rolls.
Garnish with shredded coconut, chopped cilantro and lemon juice. Serve.
