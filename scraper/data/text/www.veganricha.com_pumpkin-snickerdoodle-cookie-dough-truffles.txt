Ingredients:
1/2 cup pumpkin puree
1/2 cup maple syrup
2 tsp coconut oil or vegan butter (optional)
1 tsp pumpkin pie spice ( or 1/2 tsp cinnamon + 1/4 tsp ginger)
pinch of salt
1 to 1.5 cups flour (I use oat flour, use any flour that you would usually use to make cookie dough)
2 Tbsp granulated sugar
2 tsp ground cinnamon

Instructions:
Heat pumpkin puree, maple syrup, oil, spices and salt in a skillet at medium heat. Mix well and cook to thicken slightly,3 to 4 minutes.
Cool the mixture, add 1 cup flour and mix in. You will have to press and knead the flour in. Add more flour if needed to make a soft smooth dough. (Use any flour that you normally use to make cookie dough).Taste and add some sugar if needed.
Make balls out of the dough. In a bowl, mix in sugar and cinnamon. Roll balls to coat and serve.
Store in the refrigerator for upto 5 days.
