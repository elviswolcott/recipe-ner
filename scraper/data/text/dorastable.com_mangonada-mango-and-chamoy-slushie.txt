Ingredients:
1 cup Apricots (dried)
2 cups Water
2-3 tbsp. Chile ancho powder
2 tbsp. Lime juice (fresh)
1 tbsp. Apple cider vinegar
1 cup + 2 tbsp. Mango (diced)
1 cup Ice
6 tbsp. Chamoy
1  Lime (juice of)
Chile powder To Taste ((tajn))

Instructions:
To make the chamoy, place the dried apricots and water in a saucepot and bring it up to a boil. Lower heat and simmer for 30 min. Set aside.
Reserve  of a cup of the apricot cooking liquid.
Take the simmered apricots, reserved cooking liquid, chile ancho powder, lime juice, and apple cider vinegar and blend until smooth. Add more or less water for a thinner or thicker consistency. (I left mine a little on the thick side.) Let cool.
To make the slushie, place  cup of mango in the bottom of the blender container, add a layer of ice, continue to alternate the layers this way with the rest of your ice and 1 cup mango.
Blend on medium speed until you are left with a slushie consistency. The pieces of ice, though small, should still be seen.
To assemble, take to glasses and pour in a tbsp. of chamoy in the bottom of each one. Add a layer of mango slushie, followed by another tbsp. of chamoy. Repeat one more time.
Sprinkle 1 tbsp. of diced mango on the top of each finished slushie. Squeeze half of a lime into each glass and top with as much chile powder as you desire. Serve with a spoon and a straw.
