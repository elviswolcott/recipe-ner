Ingredients:
1/2 cup tahini (stirred)
1/3 cup coconut sugar ( or other fine sugar of choice)
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
2 tbsp non dairy milk (room temperature)
3 tbsp cocoa powder
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
1.5 tbsp coconut flour ((see notes for subs))
1 tbsp tapioca starch (or other starch)
1/4 cup mini chocolate chips

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 deg F (180 C). Line a baking sheet with parchment. Mix the tahini, sugar, vanilla, non-dairy milk until well combined. Do not over mix as the tahini will seize into a stiff mixture.&nbsp;
Add the rest of the ingredients and mix gently. (You can also add in 1/4 cup shredded coconut at this point). Add in the chocolate chips and fold in.
Shape into flattened cookies on a parchment lined baking sheet. Press a few chocolate chips on the top if needed. (You can also sprinkle some maldon salt on top and press in. Salt helps reduce the bitter profile).
Bake at 350 degrees F for 10 mins** Cool for 2 mins then remove from the baking sheet and allow to cool down completely before serving. &nbsp;
