Ingredients:
1 can (15 oz.) white beans
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon white miso paste
1 pinch ground cumin
1 teaspoon tahini
1 tablespoon olive oil
1  small clove of garlic
2  vegan tortillas
1  tomato, chopped
1  red bell pepper, cut into thin stripes
1  avocado, cut into small pieces
2  green onions, cut into rings
fresh cilantro
red pepper flakes
harissa paste, to dip

Instructions:
Wash and rinse the white beans. Put them into a food processor together with the nutritional yeast, the white miso paste, the ground cumin, the tahini, the olive oil, and the garlic. Process until smooth. Set aside.
Heat some oil in a griddle pan and gently roast the red bell pepper for about 4 minutes.
Spread the bean "cheese" evenly on the first tortilla and add the roasted red bell pepper, the tomato, the avocado, the green onions, and the cilantro on top. Sprinkle with some red pepper flakes. Then put the second tortilla on top. Cut in four pieces.
Heat some more oil (not too much, 1/2 tablespoon will be enough) in a griddle pan and cook the quesadillas for about 2 minutes on each side until they're crispy. You can also use a non-stick frying pan for an oil-free version if you like.
Top them off with some fresh cilantro and green onions and serve immediately.
