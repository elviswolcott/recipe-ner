pepita parmesan (or your favorite parm recipe)
Pizza dough - use this White garlic Crust (or any of my other pizza crusts)

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F / 220c. Prep the Pizza dough according to instruction. Roll it out into a 12 to 13 inch pizza. Let the rolled out dough sit near the warming oven for 5 minutes.
Make the pumpkin sauce: Mix everything in a bowl until well combined. Add more salt if needed.
Mix all the ingredients under chickpeas until well combined and all chickpeas are covered in spice.
Spread the pumpkin sauce over the rolled out dough evenly.
Add a layer of sliced tomatoes, then sliced onions, and other veggies like zucchini or mushrooms if using.
Add spiced chickpeas all over. Sprinkle salt and pepper. Bake for 16 to 17 minutes. Broil for a minute to brown if needed.
Remove the pizza from the oven. Add chopped fresh basil or other herbs on top. Sprinkle vegan parmesan. Let it sit for a minute, the slice and serve.
