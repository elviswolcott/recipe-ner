Add pepper flakes and chives to the skillet and mix in. Add spinach and salt and cook for 1 min(2 mins) if spinach has too much moisture. **
Add artichokes and mix in. Cook for another minute or 2 to heat up well.
Add the blended cream sauce and mix in. Continue to cook for 2-3 mins to thicken. Stir frequently to avoid sticking to the bottom. Taste carefully and adjust salt and flavor. Add salt and onion powder if needed. (You can store this dip refrigerated for upto 3 days. Broil when ready to serve).
