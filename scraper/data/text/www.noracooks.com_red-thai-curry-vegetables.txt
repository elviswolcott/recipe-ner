Ingredients:
1-2 tablespoons olive oil
1 small yellow onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon fresh ginger, grated
1  red bell pepper, thinly sliced into 2 inch slices
1  yellow bell pepper, thinly sliced into 2 inch slices
2  medium carrots, peeled and cut into matchsticks or small rounds
1  cup broccoli florets
1 cup cauliflower florets
2 1/2 tablespoons Thai red curry paste
1 15-oz can full fat coconut milk
1/2 cup water
2 cups thinly sliced kale OR spinach
2  medium roma tomatoes, diced
2 teaspoons pure maple syrup
1 tablespoon low sodium soy sauce (tamari for gluten free)
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice (about 1 lime)
4 cups cooked white or brown rice
Optional: Sriracha hot sauce, fresh chopped basil or cilantro

Instructions:
First, prepare all of the vegetables and have them close by before you heat the pan. To make the recipe easier, purchase pre-chopped vegetables or frozen. Cook your rice according to package instructions.
Heat 1-2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Once it&#039;s warm, add the chopped onion and cook, stirring often, until the onion is translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for 30 seconds.
Now add the bell peppers, carrots, broccoli and cauliflower. Continue to cook, stirring frequently, for about 2-3 minutes.
To the pan, add the red curry paste, coconut milk, and water. Stir well for a few minutes, until the curry paste is dissolved in the coconut milk/water. Now add the kale or spinach and stir it in. Bring to a simmer, then lower the heat and cook covered for 5-10 minutes, until the vegetables have softened.Â 
Stir in the chopped tomatoes, pure maple syrup, soy sauce and fresh lime juice. Remove from heat.
Serve immediately with cooked rice and optional Sriracha and fresh basil/cilantro if desired. Enjoy!
