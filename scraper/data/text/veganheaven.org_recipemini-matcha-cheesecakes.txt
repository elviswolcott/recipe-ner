Ingredients:
1/4 cup almonds
1/2 cup dates
1/3 cup amaranth
1 cup cashews
1/2 cup coconut milk (use only the hard, creamy part)
2 tablespoons agave
1.5 teaspoons matcha
vegan dark chocolate
pistachios

Instructions:
Soak the cashews for 4-6 hours.
Place the almonds into a food processor and blend until they are nicely crushed. Then add the dates and the popped amaranth and blend again until a sticky mixture forms. Press it into six silicone muffin cups and put in the freezer until you're done with the cheesecake layer.
Then make the cheesecake layer: Drain the cashews and put them together with the coconut milk and agave in a food processor and blend until it becomes creamy and smooth. Then add the matcha and blend for another minute.
Pour it evenly on the base layer and freeze for about 4-6 hours.
Allow the mini cheesecakes to warm up for about 30 minutes.
