Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1  small yellow onion, chopped small
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon fresh grated ginger
2 cups cubed butternut squash (or sweet potatoes)
1  red bell pepper, seeded and sliced into 1 inch pieces
1 medium zucchini, sliced and halved
3-4 tablespoons green curry paste (make sure it&#039;s vegan)
(2)- 13.5 ounce cans full fat coconut milk (or use light for a thinner sauce)
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2 cups cauliflower florets
2 cups broccoli florets
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
2 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce OR tamari for gluten free
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
4 cups baby spinach
1 cup frozen peas, thawed
salt, to taste
cooked rice, or serve over rice noodles
lime wedges
fresh chopped basil or cilantro
cashews

Instructions:
First, prepare all of the vegetables and have them close by before you heat the pan. Get your rice cooking.
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Once it&#039;s warm, add the chopped onion and cook, stirring often, until the onion is translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for 30 seconds.
Add the butternut squash or sweet potatoes, red bell pepper, zucchini and curry paste to the pan and cook, stirring frequently, for 2-3 minutes.
Whisk the cornstarch with a little of the coconut milk (about 1/2 cup) then add to the pan. Add the rest of the coconut milk, cauliflower, broccoli, sugar, soy sauce and lime juice. Stir.
Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 10-15 minutes, until the vegetables are tender. Stir in the baby spinach and peas and cook until the peas are heated through and the spinach has wilted. Thin with a little water, as desired.
Serve with rice or noodles, and garnish with lime wedges, basil or cilantro and chopped cashews, if desired. Enjoy!
