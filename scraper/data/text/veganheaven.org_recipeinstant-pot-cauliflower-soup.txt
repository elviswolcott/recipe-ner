Ingredients:
1  head of cauliflower  ((about 5 cups))
3  potatoes ((about 2 cups))
1  stalk of leek
1  onion
2  cloves of garlic, minced
4 cups vegetable broth
1  bay leaf
salt
black pepper
nutmeg

Instructions:
Chop the onion. With a sharp knife, remove the dark green end of the leek and discard. Then thinly slice the leek into rings. Rinse well. 
Peel and cut the potatoes into medium cubes. Remove the large leaves and break the cauliflower into large florets with your hands or use a knife. 
Press the &quot;sauté&quot; button on your Instant Pot. Add some oil and sauté the onions for about 2-3 minutes. Make sure they don&#x27;t get too brown by stirring them constantly. Then add the leek and the minced garlic. Cook for 2 minutes. 
Press the &quot;cancel&quot; button and add the cauliflower florets, the potatoes, the bay leaf, and the vegetable broth. 
Cook on high pressure for 5 minutes. When the cooking time is over, allow for 10 minutes of natural release. 
Discard the bay leaf and puree the cauliflower soup with an immersion blender. Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. If you want to make the soup extra creamy you could add some full-fat coconut cream or soy cream. I also recommend adding chopped parsley and chives to the soup.
