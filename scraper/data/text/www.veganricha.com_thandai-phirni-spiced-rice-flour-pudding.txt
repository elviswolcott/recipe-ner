Ingredients:
6-7  raw cashews
4  almonds or 1 tbsp almond powder
2-3  raw pistachios ((optional))
4  black peppercorns
1  green cardamom or 1/4 tsp ground cardamom
1/2 tsp poppy Seeds (, 1/3 tsp for less prominent flavor)
1/8 tsp fennel seeds
8  Saffron strands
1/4 tsp dried rose petals ((optional))
3 tbsp rice flour (, I use white rice flour for neutral flavor)
2.5 cups non dairy milk such as almond, soy or light coconut (, 2 cups for thicker pudding)
3.5 to 4 tbsp sugar or sweetner
1/8 tsp salt
sliced pistachios, saffron or dried rose petals for garnish

Instructions:
Thandai Blend: Grind the ingredients in a grinder, blender until a coarse mixture.
Pudding: Blend the rice flour, 1 cup non dairy milk and the thandai blend. Blend for a minute, then let it rest for a minute, then blend again for a minute. I use the same blender which has the coarse Thandai mix.
Add the rice flour thandai mixture to a saucepan over medium heat. Add the rest of the non dairy milk, sugar, salt and mix in. Bring it to a boil. The mixture will start to get lumpy, keep stirring frequently and the lumps will incorporate in the pudding. Once smooth, cook for another minute. Once the mixture is very lumpy, you can reduce the heat to medium low to avoid sticking. It takes 10 - 12 minutes total.
Cool the mixture to warm. Serve warm or chill, then garnish with sliced pistachios, saffron or dried rose petals. For a snack pudding, add nuts, seeds and coconut for garnish
