Ingredients:
1 pound asparagus
olive oil spray (or 2 teaspoons olive oil)
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon black pepper

Instructions:
Trim the chewy ends off the asparagus, about an inch or two from the bottom, either cutting them with a sharp knife or snapping with your hands.
Spray the bottom of the air fryer with olive oil.
Place the asparagus in the air fryer, in a single layer as much as possible (it&#039;s okay if some overlap a little though), and spray lightly with olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Air fry at 400 degrees F for 7-10 minutes, until crisp but not blackened and burned. Thin pieces will take only 7 minutes or so, while thicker pieces could take 10 or even 11 minutes, depending on their size. Check them often after 7 minutes to make sure the asparagus does not burn.
Serve immediately, sprinkling with some vegan parmesan, if desired. Store leftover asparagus in the refrigerator for 2-3 days, and reheat in the air fryer for about 2 minutes to re-crisp.
