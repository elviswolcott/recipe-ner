2 1/4 cups water (divided)
3/4 cup chickpea flour

2 tsp oil
1/2 cup finely chopped red onion

Instructions:
Pre-heat the oven too 400 degrees F / 200ºc. Spray or brush oil at the bottom of a baking dish. Sprinkle half of the spice mix and bay leaf on the oil.
Layer the washed and drained lentils to cover the bottom. Sprinkle the rest of the garam masala/spice blend, salt, onion flakes on the lentils.
Layer greens on top. Gently pour 1 cup of water in the dish.
