Ingredients:
3.5 cups bread flour
1/2 cup rolled oats
1 cup silken tofu
2/3 cup warm water
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon carom (ajwain seeds)
1 Tablespoon vegan  butter
1  flax egg
1/3 cup herbed olive oil or plain olive oil
1  packet quick rise yeast (1.25 teaspoons)

Instructions:
Warm the water and add the yeast and sugar to it and mix well. Let sit for 10 minutes.
Grease the mixer bowl and add the dry ingredients. Give them a good mix.
Add the cheese, egg, butter and oil and the yeast mixture and knead for about 8 minutes in batches or 2-3 minutes. Or knead by hand for the same amount of time till a nice soft non sticky dough is formed. Add more flour or water if needed.
Place dough in well oiled container. Spray cooking oil on its top and cover with plastic wrap.
Let it rise for an hour in a warm place.
Punch the dough down and knead for a few seconds.
Make a loaf out of it by pulling on all sides and tucking it under.
Place tucked side down in bread pan.
Bake in pre-heated oven at 365 degree F&nbsp; / 170ºc for 40 minutes or until nicely brown on the top.
Cool completely before slicing. I usually slice it after keeping it in the refrigerator for a few hours for nice and clean slices.
