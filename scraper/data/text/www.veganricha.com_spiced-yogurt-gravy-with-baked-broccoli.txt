1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon garam masala

1/4 cup water
1/2 cup finely chopped Broccoli (loaded)
1/4 cup Greek style So Delicious plain coconut yogurt  (or use my Almond Cashew milk yogurt from my book)
1/4 cup So Delicious plain coconut milk yogurt  (or use my Almond Cashew milk yogurt from my book)
1/4 cup chickpea flour
1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder
1/4 teaspoon red chili powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup water
2 teaspoon oil
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1/4 teaspoon fenugreek seeds (methi seeds)
2  dry red chilies or flakes to taste
1/2 inch of ginger chopped
4-5 cloves of garlic chopped
a generous pinch of hing/asafetida

Instructions:
Broccoli Fritters:
Mix all the dry ingredients well.
Add the water and mix into a thick pasty batter.
Add finely chopped Broccoli and mix to coat.
Add chopped green chili for spicier fritters.
Drop Tablespoon full blobs on parchment lined sheet.
Bake at pre-heated 410 degrees F / 210Âºc for 18 minutes.
Broil on Low for half a minute for a more brown fritter.
Yogurt Gravy/Kadhi:
In a bowl, whisk the yogurts to make them smooth.
Add chickpea flour, turmeric, chili powder, salt and mix to combine well so there are no lumps.
Add water and whisk to combine into a thin mixture.
Tempering: In a medium pan, add oil and heat on medium.
Add cumin seeds and let them cook for a half a minute
Add ginger, garlic, fenugreek seeds and red chili.
Mix and cook for another 2 minutes until garlic is golden,
Add the yogurt chickpea mixture and bring to a boil.
The Kadhi will thicken considerably. Add more water if you like a thinner consistency.
Reduce heat to low and cook for another 4-5 minutes so the chickpea flour is well cooked.
Taste and adjust salt and spice.
Soak the fritters in the yogurt gravy or serve fritters topped with a good amount of gravy like biscuits/dumplings.
Serve as is or with Rice or Naan.
