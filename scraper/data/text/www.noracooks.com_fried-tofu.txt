Ingredients:
14.5 ounce extra-firm tofu
1 tablespoon soy sauce
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, optional
2-3 tablespoons olive oil

Instructions:
Press the tofu: Press the tofu by wrapping it in paper towels (or a clean dry tea towel). Place a plate or pan on top of the wrapped tofu, and put a couple of heavy books or cast iron pan on top of that. Let the tofu press for 30 minutes to an hour. Alternatively, use a tofu press (link). You can press tofu ahead of time in batches, then store in the refrigerator, in a covered container, for up to 1 week.
Cut the pressed tofu into 1 inch cubes and add to a large bowl. Drizzle the soy sauce on top and stir gently with a silicone spatula or small spoon. Be careful not to rip the tofu.
Now sprinkle on the cornstarch and optional garlic powder. Gently stir to coat the tofu. This is what makes the tofu super crispy and delicious!
Heat a large non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil so it coats the pan.
Once the oil is hot, add the tofu in a single layer (you might need to do this in batches, depending on how big your pan is). Let the tofu brown on all sides, it should be a nice golden color all over. I use a fork to gently flip each piece over. TIP: When you place the layer of tofu in the pan, don&#39;t touch or move it at all for a few minutes, so a crust can form, making it easier to flip without ripping.
If working in batches, transfer fried tofu to a plate, and continue frying until all the tofu is cooked.
Serve immediately. To store leftovers - Keep in the refrigerator in a covered container for up to 4 days. Reheat in the air fryer, oven or stovetop to crisp it back up. You can simply microwave it, but it won&#39;t be crispy anymore.
