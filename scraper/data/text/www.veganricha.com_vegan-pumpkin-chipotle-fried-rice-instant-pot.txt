Pickled Jalapeno
Corn chips
Cilantro
Lime juice

Instructions:
Soak rice in hot water for at least 20 minutes. Wash and drain, and set aside.
Oil the bottom of the inner pot, then add in all of the ingredients, and mix well.
Close the lid, and pressure cook for 5 minutes(high pressure, vent at sealing). Let the pressure release for 8 minutes, then quick release then open the lid. Fluff, taste and adjust flavor.
Transfer the rice to a serving container so it doesnâ€™t continue to cook in the hot instant pot. top with garnishes of choice, and serve.
