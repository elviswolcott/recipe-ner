Ingredients:
1 1/4 cup all purpose flour
1/4 cup almond flour
1 cup old fashioned oats
2 tbsp shredded coconut
2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1.5 cup non dairy milk (such as almond, soy, light coconut, or oat milk)
3 tbsp of maple syrup
1 tbsp oil
1/2 cup mini chocolate chips or raisins

Instructions:
In a large bowl combine flours, oats, coconut, baking powder, baking soda, and cinnamon. mix well.
Add 1 cup of milk, maple syrup, and oil. Mix in until well combined.
Add milk 2 tbsp at a time until the mixture is not too stiff. Fold in the chocolate chips or raisins.
Heat your waffle maker and cook the waffles according to the instructions based on your waffle maker.
The waffle mixture might get thick while sitting so add in more milk if needed. Serve with your favorite toppings such as maple syrup, vegan butter, berries, fruits etc.   Store: You can store these in the refrigerator for up to 5 days and freeze them for up to 2 months. When freezing, I would recommend you wrap the waffles individually in parchment and place them all in a large freezer bag.To reheat them, pop them in the toaster oven or the waffle maker.
