Ingredients:
1 cup earth balance vegan butter, softened to room temperature
3 cups powdered sugar
2-3 tablespoons unsweetened non-dairy milk
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

Instructions:
Beat the vegan butter with an electric mixer until creamy.
Gradually add the powdered sugar, about 1/2 cup at a time, until all the powdered sugar is mixed in.
With the mixer on low-medium speed, add the non-dairy milk, 1 tablespoon at a time. Add the vanilla as well, and increase the speed to high. Beat for about 30 seconds, until light and fluffy.
If the frosting seems too thick, you can add more non-dairy milk, 1 tablespoon at a time. If the frosting is too thin and runny, simply add more powdered sugar, 1/2 cup at a time until the desired consistency is reached.
Use it to frost Funfetti Cupcakes, Chocolate Cake (or cupcakes) or Vegan Vanilla Cake.
You can store the frosting in the refrigerator for 1-2 weeks. It will firm up when it's cold, so let it soften at room temperature a bit before frosting a cake or cupcakes with it.
