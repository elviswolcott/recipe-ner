Ingredients:
1/2 cup smooth peanut butter (Or use almond butter or cashew butter for peanutfree )
1/3 cup maple syrup
2 tbsp non-dairy milk such as almond (soy, oat or coconut milk)
3/4 cup of flour (,I use all-purpose. Use gf flour blend of choice or oat flour )
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/3 tsp  salt (adjust based on peanut butter is already salted or not)
1  heaping cup of soft dates
2 tbsp of peanut butter or almond butter
1/8 tsp Salt
1/3 cup  nondairy milk
1 tbsp of shredded coconut optional
3 to 4 tbsp roasted peanuts
1/4 to 1/3 cup vegan chocolate chips

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350F (176C) and line a 9x9 inch pan with parchment.
In a bowl add the peanut butter, maple syrup, and non-dairy milk and warm in a microwave for half a minute. Whisk well to combine. Add the rest of the dry ingredients and mix well
Press this cookie layer mixture into the parchment-lined pan and even it out. Soak the dates in hot water for 15 minutes. Drain the dates and blend them with the rest of the ingredients under caramel until smooth, you can use a blender or a food processor.
Press the peanuts into the cookie layer then top it with the blended caramel mixture and bake for 30 minutes. Top with the chocolate chips and bake for another 5 minutes, then spread out the melted chocolate chips with a spatula to cover the caramel evenly. you can also use the double boiler to melt the chocolate and drizzle all over instead.
Cool completely and freeze for few hours and slice and then store refrigerated for up to a week or freeze for up to a month.
