Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup almond milk
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup agave
3/4 cup cocoa powder
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon natural vanilla extract
1  flax egg ((1 tablespoon ground flaxseeds + 3 tablespoons of water))
3 tablespoons unsweetened applesauce
2 1/2 tablespoons melted coconut oil
1/2 cup vegan chocolate chips
1/2 cup tahini
2 tablespoons tahini
1/4 cup chopped cashews
1/2 cup dark chocolate, melted

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 Â°F.
Make the flax egg: Grind one tablespoon of flax seeds in a food processor or use store-bought ground flax seeds. Add 3 tablespoons of water and set aside to thicken for about 5 minutes.
Then make the batter: Combine all ingredients (including the flax egg) in a large bowl and stir with a wooden spoon until well combined. Lightly grease a baking tray (10" x 8") and pour in the batter.  Spread evenly.
Put two tablespoons of tahini on top of the brownie batter and swirl with the tip of a butter knife. Sprinkle with the chopped cashews and bake for 25 minutes.
Let the brownies cool down in the baking tray. Melt the chocolate in the microwave or on the stove top. Drizzle on top of the brownies. Cut them into 12-18 pieces, depending on how big you want them. Enjoy!
