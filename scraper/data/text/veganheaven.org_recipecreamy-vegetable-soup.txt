Ingredients:
5  large potatoes ((about 26 oz))
6  large carrots ((about 26 oz))
2 stalks of leek
3 cups celeriac ((about 10 oz))
1 bunch of parsley
4 cups vegetable broth
salt
black pepper

Instructions:
Cut the potatoes and the celeriac into medium-sized cubes (about 1 inch). Cut the carrots into half lengthwise and slice them. Slice the leek into rings. 
Heat some oil in a large pot and add the vegetables. Cook for 5 minutes on high heat. Stir a few times. 
Add the vegetable broth. Cover with a lid and bring to a boil.
Let it simmer for 15 minutes or until the vegetables are tender. 
Scoop out about 1/4 of the soup with a ladle.
Use an immersion blender or a regular blender or food processor to puree it until smooth. 
Transfer back to the pot. Add the freshly chopped parsley and season with salt and pepper. 
Serve with roasted rustic bread.
