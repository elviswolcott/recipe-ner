Ingredients:
4  ripe bananas, cut into slices and frozen for at least 12 hours
8  oreo cookies
1 tablespoon chunky peanut butter
1 tablespoon peanuts

Instructions:
Put the frozen bananas, the chunky peanut butter, and three of the oreo cookies in a blender and process until smooth. If needed add a little almond or other plant-based milk to make it easier for the blender.
When the nice cream is smooth add three more oreo cookies and pulse for a about three seconds.
Fill the nice cream into two cups and top if off with the remaining two oreos (crumbled), the peanuts, and some banana slices. Enjoy!
