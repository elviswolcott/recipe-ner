Ingredients:
1  cup  unripe spelt grains (kibbled)
8-10  whole wheat lasagna sheets
1  carrot
3  stalks celery
1  onion
2  garlic cloves, minced
1  zucchini
4  mushrooms
4 tablespoons tomato paste
1 can (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes
1/2  cup  red wine
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 teaspoon oregano
1/2  cup vegetable broth
2 tablespoons olive oil
Some  vegan cheese to sprinkle on top (Daiya or another brand of your choice)
1/2  block firm tofu (7 oz)
1/2 cup fresh spinach or basil leaves
1/4 cup oat milk or other plant-based milk (it should be unsweetened)
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar

Instructions:
Cook the unripe spelt according to the instructions on the package.
Chop the vegetables into small pieces.
Peel and chop the onion.
In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Then add the onion and garlic and sauté for a few minutes, until the onion is translucent.
Add the vegetables and fry for another 2-3 minutes.
Stir in the cooked unripe spelt and the tomate paste and sauté for 3 minutes.
Deglaze with red wine. Reduce the heat and simmer for a minute. Then add the diced tomatoes and the vegetable broth and simmer for another 10 minutes. Season the sauce with salt, pepper, oregano, and soy sauce.
Meanwhile, make the cashew-spinach ricotta. In a blender, combine the cashews, tofu, spinach, white wine vinegar, and oatmilk and blend until smooth, adding another splash of oatmilk if needed.
Add a cup of the veggie-tomate sauce at the bottom of your casserole dish. Then add a layer of lasagna sheets, tomato sauce, and spinach ricotta. Continue with another layer of sauce, noodles and spinach ricotta. Put the rest of the veggie-tomate sauce on top and sprinkle with some vegan cheese (Daiya or the brand of your choice).
Bake at 350 F (180 C) for 34-40 minutes.
