1/4 cup + 2 Tbsp ground raw pistachio
1/8 tsp baking soda
1/8 tsp salt
2 tbsp vegan butter or oil
2 tbsp non dairy yogurt or cashew cream (I use So Delicious Plain Coconut milk yogurt)
1/3 cup + 1 tbsp powdered vegan sugar (use a Tbsp less for less sweet)
1/4 tsp almond extract
1/4 tsp vanilla extract (optional)
3 Tbsp apricot preserves or jam

Instructions:
In a bowl, combine the flour, ground pistachio, baking soda and salt. whisk well.
In another bowl, melt the vegan butter. Add non dairy yogurt, sugar and almond extract and mix until well combined.
Add the dry to the bowl and mix until combined. The dough should be soft and well formed. Add a tsp or so more flour if too sticky, or a sprinkle of non dairy milk if too dry.
Chill for 15 to 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 345 degrees F / 170Âºc
Make small balls of the dough and press in the center to make a deep dent. Place on parchment lined baking sheet.
Take 3 to 4 Tbsp apricot preserves/jam in a small bowl and whisk a bit to make it smooth. Fill the cookies with 1/2 to 3/4 tsp apricot preserves.
Bake for 15 to 16 minutes. Cool completely and serve or store.
