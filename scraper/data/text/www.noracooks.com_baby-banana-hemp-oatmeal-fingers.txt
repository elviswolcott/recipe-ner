Ingredients:
1 small hunk banana, about 1/6 of a whole banana
1/4 cup quick cooking oats
1/4 cup soy, almond or coconut milk
1-2 tsp hemp seeds
sprinkle cinnamon, optional

Instructions:
First, get a cereal sized bowl out and mash the banana in it.
Add the quick cooking oats, milk, hemp seeds and a sprinkle of cinnamon, if using. Mix well with a fork or spoon, scraping the sides down as good as you can.
Place the bowl in microwave and cook for 2 minutes.
Let sit for at least 5 minutes before cutting into about 4 "fingers". Make sure they are not too hot for baby, and serve!&nbsp;
