Ingredients:
1 small potato, peeled and cut into very small pieces
1 medium onion, chopped
3-4 medium cloves of garlic, minced
1/2 cup cashews
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 cup unsweetend almond milk
1/2 teaspoon mustard
salt
black pepper
2 cups broccoli
17 oz fettuccine
lemon slices, to serve
chopped fresh parsley, to serve
black pepper
3.5 oz textured soy stripes/chunks ((also known as textured vegetable protein))
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon liquid smoke ((optional))
1 teaspoon paprika powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
salt
black pepper

Instructions:
Cook the potato for about 10 minutes or until tender.
Cook the TVP for about 10 minutes in vegetable broth on very low heat. Once they're ready, let them cool down a bit and then use your hands and squeeze out as much water as you can. They're kind of like little sponges. Set aside.
Cook the fettuccine according to the instructions on the package. Cook the broccoli for about 3-4 minutes.
Then make the vegan Alfredo sauce: Heat some oil in a large pan (you'll need this one later on to combine the sauce and the pasta) and saut√© the onion and the garlic for about 3 minutes. Put in a blender with the rest of the ingredients and process until smooth.
Heat one tablespoon of canola oil in a frypan and add the soy stripes. Season with soy sauce, liquid smoke, paprika powder, onion and garlic powder, salt, and black pepper and pan-fry for about 5 minutes or until crispy and golden.
Put the vegan alfredo sauce in a large pan and cook for a minute until it becomes creamy and thick. Add the pasta, the broccoli and the vegan "chicken". Sprinkle with fresh parsley and black pepper and serve with lemon slices.
