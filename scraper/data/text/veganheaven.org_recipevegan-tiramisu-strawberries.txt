Ingredients:
1/4 cup dates
1/4 cup almonds
1 cup cashews, soaked for about 2 hours
1/4 cup very thick coconut milk (full fat)
6  strawberries
1/2 cup strawberries

Instructions:
First make the strawberry sauce. Blend 1/2 cup of strawberries until they form a creamy sauce and set aside.
Then make the "cookie" base. Blend the almonds and the dates together in a food processor until they form a sticky mass. Don't blend them for too long. You want it to be sticky, but still a bit crunchy, so you get some nice texture. Divide the mixture evenly into two dessert glasses, pressing it into the bottom of the glas using your fingers.
Next is the "mascarpone" layer. Put the cashews and the coconut milk in a blender and process until smooth. Then put about half of it on the "cookie" base (this will be the white layer). Freeze the glasses for about 15 minutes (maybe a bit longer if you want the layers to be more accurate).
Then add the strawberries and blend again for a minute until the mixture becomes lightly pink. First put a thin layer of strawberry sauce on the first "mascarpone"/ cashew layer and freeze again for another 15 minutes. Then add the second, pink layer.
Top it off with some cacao, some dark chocolate, strawberries, and blueberries. Enjoy!
