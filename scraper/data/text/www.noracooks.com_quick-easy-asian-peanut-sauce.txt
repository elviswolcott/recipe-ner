Ingredients:
3/4 cup creamy peanut butter
1/4 cup rice vinegar
1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce (use tamari for gluten free)
1/3 cup pure maple syrup OR agave
1/4 teaspoons ground ginger (or 2 teaspoons fresh grated ginger)
1-2 teaspoons Sriracha hot sauce
2-6 tablespoons unsweetened coconut milk, as needed (SEE NOTE)

Instructions:
In a medium sized bowl, whisk all the ingredients together until smooth. Start with just 2 tablespoons of coconut milk, and add more as needed to thin the sauce.
If serving as a dip, sprinkle with crushed peanuts. The sauce also goes well with noodles, buddha bowls, fresh spring rolls, tofu and salads.
Store in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. It can also be frozen in a freezer safe container.
