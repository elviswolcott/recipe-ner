Ingredients:
3 cups Corn kernels (fresh (about 4 ears))
3 cups Almond milk
3/4 cup Sugar, granulated (or other vegan sweetener)
1 tsp. Vanilla extract

Instructions:
Place corn, almond milk, and sugar in a large pot. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Once it simmers, turn the heat off and take off the stove.
Let cool to room temperature.
Place mixture in the blender, add vanilla, and process until smooth. (You can leave chunky if that is your preference.)
Straining the mixture is completely optional.
Pour into popsicle molds and freeze for 5 hours.
