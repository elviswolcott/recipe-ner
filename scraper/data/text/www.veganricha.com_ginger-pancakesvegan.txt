Ingredients:
3 tablespoons Bobs Red mill organic 7 grain Pancake mix ((already has salt and rising agent))
1.5 tablespoons self rising flour
3-4 tablespoons water/almond milk
2 tablespoons ginger syrup or 1 tablespoon Agave syrup and 1/2 teaspoon ginger powder
1 teaspoon crystallized ginger ((1/2 cm pieces))
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon raisins ((optional))
vegan butter for cooking and serving
warm maple or agave syrup for serving

Instructions:
I made some crystallized Ginger for the Ginger Molasses Cookies and had some ginger syrup left. Recipe for crystallized ginger and ginger syrup here.
The syrup is the water and sugar in which the ginger is boiled for 45 minutes or so to make the candied ginger. There is usually some thick syrup left over.
In a large bowl, add in the flours, ginger syrup, crystallized ginger pieces, lemon juice and water or almond milk. Mix till just abut combined.
Add more milk or water, 1 teaspoon at a time if the mixture is too thick.
Add in the raisins and give a quick mix. Let mixture sit for 5 minutes
Heat a pancake griddle or pan and spread some vegan butter on it.
Drop large spoonfulls on batter on the pan.
Cook on medium heat for 3-4 minutes till the bubbles appear on top and the batter is soft but not runny.
flip and cook 2-3 minutes on the other side
Serve hot with butter, maple or agave syrup, fresh fruits of choice and tea or coffee!
