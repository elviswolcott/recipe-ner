Ingredients:
2 cans full fat canned coconut milk
vegan probiotic capsules totaling 50 billion active cells
1 teaspoon agar agar powder ((it serves as a thickener) )

Instructions:
Pour two cans of full fat canned coconut milk into your instant pot. Make sure to use an Instant Pot with a yogurt function. I used the Instant Pot Duo 6 Quart for my coconut yogurt.
Carefully open a vegan probiotic capsule and pour its content into the Instant Pot. You should have a total of 50 billion active cells. If you have probiotic capsules with less active cells, just use several capsules to reach 50 billion. Only add the content of the capsule to the coconut milk, not the whole capsule. Also add the agar agar at this point. 
&nbsp;Stir with a whisk or spoon until well combined.
Press the &quot;Yogurt&quot; button on your Instant Pot and set it to 24 hours using the &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; buttons. Then let the Instant Pot do its thing.
After 24 hours open the Instant Pot. Please note that the yogurt will still be pretty thin and runny. Don&#039;t worry, that&#039;s normal. It will get considerably thicker when it&#039;s cooled for at least another 24 hours in the fridge.
After opening the lid, transfer the coconut yogurt into small glass jars or plastic containers.
Store them in the fridge for at least 24 hours. The longer you store the yogurt the thicker it will get.
Serve the coconut yogurt with fresh berries or granola.
