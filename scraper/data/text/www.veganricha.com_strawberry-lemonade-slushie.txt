1 heaping cup frozen strawberry
3-4 tbsp lemon juice
2 tbsp maple syrup
4  mint leaves or more for garnish
1 cup ice
1/2 to 1 cup of water

Instructions:
Add the strawberries, lemon juice, maple syrup, mint and ice to blender.
Add a 1/2 cup of water and blend initially in bursts, then longer 15-20 second cycles.  Depending on the blender, you may need to move it around. Add water a few tbsp at a time and keep blending until you get a consistency that you prefer and all the ingredients are blended well.
Scoop into serving glasses or bowls. Garnish with mint leaves and serve immediately.
