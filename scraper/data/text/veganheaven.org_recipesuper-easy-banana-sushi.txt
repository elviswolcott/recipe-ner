Ingredients:
3  bananas
2 tablespoons peanut butter (I used unsweetened peanut butter)
1 3.5-ounce package vegan dark chocolate
3 tablespoons chopped pistachios
2 tablespoons sesame seeds
1 tablespoon chia seeds

Instructions:
Peel the bananas and coat them with the peanut butter.
Melt the chocolate (either by using a microwave or place it into a heatproof bowl and put it over a pan of barely simmering water).
Cover the bananas with the melted chocolate and sprinkle them with the above named toppings.
Let the chocolate harden for a couple of minutes, this will take about 5-10 minutes depending on how warm it is in your kitchen. On hot summer days, put them in the freezer for a few minutes.
Cut them into bite-sized sushi pieces with a sharp knife. You can either eat the banana sushi right away or freeze it for an hour and two and enjoy it as easy vegan ice cream bites.
