Ingredients:
3/4 cup pumpkin puree
1 cup soy milk (or other plant milk)
1/2 cup water
2 tablespoons canola oil, melted coconut oil or applesauce
2 tablespoons pure maple syrup
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all purpose flour OR whole wheat pastry flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Instructions:
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the pumpkin puree, soy milk, water, oil or applesauce, maple syrup and vanilla until smooth and well combined.
Add the flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg to the bowl with the wet ingredients, and stir with a large spoon until combined, but do not over mix. A few small lumps are okay.
Heat a large griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Grease the pan or spray with oil unless you have a good nonstick pan. Drop about 1/3 cup of the batter onto the griddle. Cook until bubbles form, then flip and cook until golden brown on the other side, about 1-2 minutes. Repeat with all the remaining batter.
Serve with vegan whipped cream, pure maple syrup, vegan butter, chopped pecans, vegan caramel or stir in chocolate chips for pumpkin chocolate chip pancakes. Enjoy!
