Ingredients:
3   carrots
3 cups cauliflower
1 1/2 cups green beans
1 cup peas
2  potatoes
1 can diced tomatoes
1 can  full-fat coconut milk
1/2 cup cashews
1  onion
4  cloves of garlic
1  inch piece of ginger
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
2 teaspoons curry powder
1 teaspoon garam masala
1/2 teaspoon turmeric
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon cardamom

Instructions:
Before you start with this recipe: soak the cashews for 1 hour in boiling water from the tea kettle. 
Cut the carrots into half moons, the cauliflower into small florets, and the potatoes into medium-sized cubes. Cook the potatoes for 5 minutes in boiling water. Then add the remaining vegetables and cook them for another 5 minute. 
Finely chop the onion, the garlic, and the ginger. 
In a large pan, heat some oil and sauté the onion for 3 minutes until translucent. Then add the garlic and the ginger and cook for 2 more minutes. 
Next, add the spices and cook for another minute until fragrant.
Place the onion mixture into a food processor or high speed blender along with the coconut milk, the canned diced tomatoes, and the cashews. 
Process until smooth. Pour the sauce into a pan and heat on medium heat. 
Drain the cooked vegetables. Add the vegetables to the sauce and stir well.
Sprinkle with freshly chopped cilantro and red pepper flakes and serve over rice or with naan bread. Enjoy!
