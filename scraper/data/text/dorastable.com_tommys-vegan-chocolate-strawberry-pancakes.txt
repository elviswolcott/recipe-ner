Ingredients:
1  cup Almond milk, unsweetened
1  tbsp. Flaxseed, ground
1/4  cup Maple syrup
2  tsp. Apple cider vinegar
1/2  cup  Water
2  tbsp.  Coconut oil  ((sub unsweetened apple sauce))
1  tsp. Vanilla extract
3/4 cup All-purpose flour
3/4  cup  Whole wheat flour
3 1/2 tsp.  Baking powder
1/2  tsp.  Salt, kosher
1  tsp. Ground Mexican cinnamon
1/3  cup Cocoa powder, unsweetened
1  cup Thinly sliced strawberries

Instructions:
In a small bowl combine the almond milk, ground flaxseed. Mix well, and let rest for 5 minutes.&nbsp;
Add vinegar, water, vanilla extract, and oil (or applesauce) to the almond milk mixture. Whisk to incorporate.
In a large bowl, combine the flours, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and cocoa powder.&nbsp;
Make a well in the center of the flour bowl and add liquid mixture. Whisk until a lumpy batter forms.&nbsp;Let rest for 10 min.
To cook pancakes, heat a skillet to medium-low heat and grease lightly. Pour batter onto pan and place 3 strawberries on the pancake batter. Use a spoon to spread some of the batter on top of the strawberries to cover them. Let cook for about 3 min. or until fluffy and golden brown.
Flip and cook pancake on other side for 3 more minutes.
Repeat with the rest of the batter.&nbsp;
Serve with maple syrup.
