Ingredients:
1 cup all purpose flour
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2  cup + 2 tablespoons soy milk
1 tablespoon applesauce
1 tablespoon melted vegan butter
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup melted vegan butter

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and spray a donut pan with non-stick spray.
Whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and cinnamon in a large bowl. Pour the soy milk, applesauce, melted vegan butter (1 tablespoon) and vanilla into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Mix well with a large wooden spoon to combine. The batter will be similar to cake batter; not too thick but not very runny either.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Spoon the batter into the donut pan, OR fill a large ziplock bag with the batter, cut a hole in the corner and pipe into the pan, filling about 3/4 of the way full. Be careful not to overfill, as the donuts will rise and you might lose the &quot;hole&quot; of your donut.Â 
Bake for 9-10 minutes or until the edges are lightly golden brown. If your donut pan is larger than mine, they could take a few extra minutes to bake. Let cool for two or three minutes in the pan, then carefully transfer to a wire rack with a large piece of parchment paper beneath it (to help with the mess).
