Ingredients:
1 cup bread flour
2-3 cups whole wheat flour
1 tablespoon oil
1 tablespoon vegan butter
2/3 cup water
1 teaspoon sugar
3 tablespoons dark Molasses
1  packet quick rise yeast ((1.25 teaspoons))
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup oats
1/3 cup flax seed
1.5 cups green or red seedless grapes

Instructions:
Warm 1/4 cup(60ml) water and add sugar and yeast to it . Mix well and keep aside for 10 minutes or until frothy.
In a blender, add flax seed and oats and grind coarsely. Just a few quick short pulses.
Add grapes and molasses and blend till grapes are blended. Use water if needed, though the grapes will be moist enough to make a puree.
Grease the mixer bowl and add in the flours and salt. Mix well.
Add in the oil , grape mixture, water and yeast mixture and vegan butter(optional, substitute another tablespoon of oil) and knead for 10-12 minutes( batches of 3-4 minutes and then scrape the bowl and wait for the mixer to cool a little if too warm)
Dough should be soft and pliable. Use more flour or water if needed. The molasses will give the dough a nice brown color and some additional stickiness.
Place dough in well oiled container, covered with plastic wrap in a warm place for 1.5 hours
Punch dough down and knead for a minute with additional flour if needed. Shape into loaf by pulling on all sides and tucking under. Use flour on hands to avoid dough sticking to hands.
Place loaf in well oiled bread pan and cover with a damp kitchen towel. Let rise for 45 minutes. Bake loaf at 375 degrees F for 40 minutes.
Cool completely before slicing. I usually place the cooled bread in the refrigerator for half an our before slicing with an electric knife for nice and clean slices!
