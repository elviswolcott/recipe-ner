Ingredients:
1 cup red lentils
1 tablespoon coconut oil
2  carrots, cut into small chunks
1 cup coconut milk
1 piece of ginger (about 1 inch), chopped
3 cloves of garlic, minced
1  red onion, chopped
1  sweet potato, cut into small chunks
4 cups vegetable broth
2 teaspoons curry powder
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
2  green onions, cut into rings
1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
2 tablespoons pumpkin seeds
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste
red pepper flakes (optional)

Instructions:
In a large pot, heat the coconut oil and saut√© the onions for about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and the ginger and cook it for another minute. Then add the carrots, the lentils, and the sweet potato and the curry powder.
After 2 minutes, deglaze with the vegetable broth. Cover with a lid and cook for 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
When the the vegetables and the lentils are tender, either transfer the soup into a blender or use an immersion blender. Puree until very smooth. I prefer the soup very thick, if you want it to be thinner, just add more vegetable broth.
Pour it back into the pot. Reheat and season again with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes and add the lemon juice. Serve with fresh chopped parsley, green onions, and pumpkin seeds.
