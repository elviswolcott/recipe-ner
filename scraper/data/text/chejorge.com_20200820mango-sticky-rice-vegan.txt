Ingredients:
2  fresh, ripe mangoes
1 cup sweet sticky rice
200 grams full fat coconut milk
1/3 cup sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 tablespoon cornstarch

Instructions:
Make the Sticky Rice. Soak Rice with water (place in fridge) for at least 6 hours, preferably over-night. Drain the rice and let sit for at least 30 minutes before cooking. Spread rice into a parchment lined bamboo steamer and steam for around 30 minutes, or until grains are translucent and tender. Remove sticky rice from bamboo steamer and set aside.
Prepare Mangoes. Peel Mangos and slice into bite-sized chunks or thin slices.
Make the Sweet Coconut Sauce. Add coconut milk, sugar, and salt to a medium-sized sauce pan. Bring to a boil, then pour half of it into the finished sticky rice.
Finish the Sweet Coconut Sauce. Whisk together 1/2 tablespoon of cornstarch with 1 tablespoon of water to make a slurry. Add slurry to the remaining coconut sauce; stir until thickened (may need to bring to a boil again). To plate, assemble rice and sliced mangoes, then pour finished sauce over. Garnish with additional toppings and serve immediately.
