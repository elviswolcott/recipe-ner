Ingredients:
1 cup dried mushrooms
1  onion, finely chopped
2  cloves of garlic, minced
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon tomato paste
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 1/2 cups vegetable broth
1/4 cup full-fat canned coconut milk
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary
salt
black pepper

Instructions:
In a small bowl, combine the dried mushrooms and 1 1/2 cups of water. Let it soak for 1-2 hours.
In a large pan, heat some vegan butter or margarine. Sauté the chopped onion for about 3 minutes until it becomes translucent. Then add the minced garlic and cook for another minute.
Add the flour and the tomato paste. Stir well.
Cook for for about 3 minutes. Then add the mushrooms (including the water they were soaked in) and the vegetable broth. Stir well and bring to a boil. Let it cook for a minute. 
Then add the canned coconut milk, the soy sauce, the thyme, and the rosemary. Season with salt and black pepper. 
Transfer everything into a blender and process until very smooth. Pour into a small pot or the pan you just used and heat again. Serve immediately or save it for later.
