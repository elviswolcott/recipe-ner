Ingredients:
1 cup creamy peanut butter
8 ounces vegan cream cheese
1 cup powdered sugar
9 ounce package Coco Whip (I used So Delicious brand)
chopped vegan peanut butter cups
additional Coco Whip
drizzle of chocolate sauce
about 4 graham crackers (vegan) crushed

Instructions:
In a large bowl of a stand mixer with whisk attachment (or use an electric hand mixer), beat the peanut butter and cream cheese until smooth.
Add the powdered sugar and beat it in.
Lastly, add the whipped topping and beat until combined and smooth.
Serve with optional toppings. I like to crush a few graham crackers and make peanut butter mousse parfaits, layered with vegan whipped cream, chocolate sauce, the graham cracker crumbs and vegan peanut butter cups.
