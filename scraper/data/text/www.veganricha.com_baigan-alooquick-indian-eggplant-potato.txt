Ingredients:
4-5  small indian eggplants chopped
2  medium potatoes cubed
2 Teaspoons oil
1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds
1/2 teaspoon coriander seeds
1/2  tespoon cumin powder
pinch of asofetida (hing)
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder (haldi)
5  curry leaves
1 teaspoon ginger chopped
1 teaspoon garlic chopped (3 cloves)
1  Serrano chili pepper chopped
1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste
1   tpmato chopped (optional)
Cilantro for garnish

Instructions:
In a large pan, heat oil on medium heat for 2 minutes.
Add in the mustard seeds and let them splutter.
Add in the curry leaves and hing and give it a mix
Add in the coriander seeds, cumin powder, ginger, garlic and chili and cook for 2 minutes
Add in the potatoes and turmeric and mix well to coat. Cook for 2-3 minutes
Add in the eggplants, tomato and salt and mix well to coat with all the spices.
Cover and cook on low heat for 15-20 minutes stirring occasionally. I like my eggplants well cooked so i cook the dish for a few minutes longer. My mom likes hers just about done and not very mashed, so she cooks on low heat and doesnt stir it much.
Serve hot garnished with freshly chopped cilantro leaves, with Rotis or Naan and a side dish of Daal(lentil curry)
