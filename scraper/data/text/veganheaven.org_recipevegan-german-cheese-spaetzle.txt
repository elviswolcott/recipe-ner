Ingredients:
1 3/4 cup wheat flour
1/2 cup durum wheat semolina
3 tablespoons soy flour
8.11 fl oz sparkling water
1 pinch curcuma
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 pinch black pepper
1 heaped cup unsalted cashews
1/4 cup unsweetened almond or soy milk
1 teaspoon white wine vinegar
1,5  teaspoon mustard
1 pinch salt
1 pinch black pepper, to taste
1 pinch curcuma
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
3 tablespoons nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon miso paste
1  leek, cut into rings
7 oz smoked tofu, cut into cubes
2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped

Instructions:
First make the cashew cheese sauce: Place all ingredients into a food processor and process until smooth. Set aside.
Bring a large pot of salted water to boil.
In a medium pan, heat one tablespoon of olive oil and stir-fry the tofu cubes until they're crispy and lightly golden. Set aside and cook the leak together with one tablespoon of water for about 5 minutes in the same pan.
Then make the spaetzle: Combine all ingredients in a medium bowl and stir well with a wooden spoon (the dough should be pretty soft).
Fill the spaetzle dough into a potato ricer and press it into the boiling water (don't put it into the hot water, but just let the dough drop into the water). The spaetzle will be ready when they rise to the surface (this will take about 2-3 minutes). Skim and put aside.
In a large pan heat the cashew cheese sauce, add the leek, the tofu and gently stir in the spaetzle. Season with salt and pepper and sprinkle with fresh parsley.
