Ingredients:
8 oz firm tofu (, lightly squeezed to remove excess flowing water, sliced, (see notes for soyfree))
1.5 tbsp lemon juice
2 tsp apple cider vinegar
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp dill
1 tsp dried basil
1 tbsp nutritional yeast
1/4 cup finely chopped green pepper
1/4 cup finely chopped red bell pepper
1/4 cup chopped spring onion
1/4 cup finely chopped sun-dried tomato (, dry , not packed in oil)
1/2 cup baby spinach or basil or other fresh herbs
2  large tortillas (, gluten-free if needed (see notes for recipe for my gluten-free tortillas))

Instructions:
Squeeze the tofu between paper towels to remove the excess water and slice. Add the cream cheese ingredients  in a small food processor and process until smooth. Transfer to a bowl. Taste and adjust flavor (salt, tang, add a pinch of sugar to balance if needed)
Add the peppers, onion and sun dried tomato and mix. Chill for 15 mins.
Spread the mixture on 2 large tortillas, spread evenly, not more than 1/4 inch thick.
Add baby spinach or fresh herbs on top. Roll the tortillas tightly, use a little cream cheese to seal the ends. Chill for atleast 2 hours so that the cream cheese can get stiff and the rolls ups can be sliced easily. Slice with a sharp serrated knife. Serve cold.
These pinwheels can also be served pan-fried. Lightly dust flour on both sides and pan fry until golden and serve. (This is how hubbs ate all)
