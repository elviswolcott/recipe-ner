1 Tablespoon wheat flour or Oat flour for gf
1 Tablespoon ground raw cashew or almond
1/8 teaspoon baking powder
1.5 Tablespoons So Delicious Blueberry Greek Yogurt + 1/2 teaspoon almond milk Or 2 Tablespoons So Delicious Blueberry regular yogurt.

2 Tablespoons blueberries (optional)
1.5 Tablespoons Oats flour or any flour of choice
1/2 teaspoon virgin coconut oil (solid)
a generous pinch of cinnamon or other spices of choice
2 teaspoons raw sugar ground (1 teaspoon more if you like it sweeter (or use vegan brown sugar))
a pinch of salt
1-2 drops agave syrup if needed

Instructions:
In a ramekin, mix all the dry ingredients for the cake (except blueberries if using).
Add the wet ingredients and mix until well combined. Add blueberries and mix.
Use a spoon to even out the thick batter.
For the crumb, mix all the dry ingredients, then add coconut oil. Using your hand, mix all the ingredients till the coconut oil is well distributed. Dont over mix as the oil will start to melt.
Drop the crumb on top of the cake batter.
