Ingredients:
1/4 tsp oil
1/2 cup steel cut oats (use certified gluten-free if needed)
1 1/2 cups water (2 cups for thinner consistency)
1 cup non dairy milk
1/3 tsp or more turmeric
1/3-1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp or more cardamom
1/8 tsp salt
2 tbsp or more maple or other sweetener of choice.

Instructions:
Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the oats and toast for 2 minutes or until fragrant.
Add in the water and milk and mix. Bring to a boil. (about 5 mins)
Reduce heat to medium low. Stir and continue to cook for 10 mins.
Mix in the spices, salt and maple and cook for another 7 minutes or longer until the oats are cooked to preference. Taste and adjust sweet and flavors. The oats will need a few minutes longer if you double/increase the recipe.
There might be some extra liquid in the saucepan. The liquid keeps getting absorbed by the oats as the porridge sits. Cook for a few minutes longer or let it cool for 10-15 minutes to thicken.
Garnish with sliced strawberries, chia seeds, pepita seeds, currants or other fresh or dried fruit of choice. Serve warm or chilled.
