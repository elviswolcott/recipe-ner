Ingredients:
16 oz button mushrooms
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
3  cloves of garlic
1/2 cup freshly chopped parsley

Instructions:
Clean the mushrooms. Heat some olive oil in a cast iron skillet and pan-fry the bottom mushrooms on high heat until browned. This will take about 5 minutes.
Cut the garlic into medium-sized chunks (see pictures) and add them to the balsamic vinegar. 
Add the balsamic vinegar and garlic mixture to the mushrooms. Cook for about 5-6 minutes, stirring occasionally. The balsamic vinegar should thicken considerably until it reaches the consistency of maple syrup. 
Finely chop the parsley. Sprinkle the mushrooms with the chopped parsley.
