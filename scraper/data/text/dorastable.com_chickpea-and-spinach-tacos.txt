Ingredients:
1 tbsp. Vegetable oil (optional)
3 cloves Garlic (minced)
8 oz. Spinach (cleaned, 1 bag)
1/8 cup Vegetable stock
1 can (14.5 oz) Chickpeas (drained, rinsed)
1  Avocado (sliced)
1 pint Cherry tomatoes (sliced in half)
 cup Pepitas (toasted)
9  Corn tortillas

Instructions:
Heat oil in a large sauté pan to medium heat. Add the garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes until the garlic begins to release its aroma.
Add the spinach and the 1/8 of a cup of vegetable stock. Cover and let cook for 3 – 4 minutes until the spinach has wilted and cooked down.
Add the chickpeas, stir, cook for 1 minute to ensure they are warm, and season with salt and pepper.
Serve with warm corn tortillas and top with cherry tomatoes, avocado slices, your favorite salsa, and toasted pepitas for some crunch.
