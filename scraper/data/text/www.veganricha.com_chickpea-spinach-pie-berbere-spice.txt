Ingredients:
2  vegan puff pastry sheets
1 tsp olive oil
1  small red onion (, thinly sliced or chopped)
5 cloves of garlic (, finely chopped)
3/4 tsp ground cumin  (, or 1/2 tsp cumin + 1/2 tsp coriander)
1 to 2 tsp berbere spice blend
1/4 to 1/2 tsp cayenne or pepper flakes
a good dash of black pepper
15  oz can chickpeas (, or 1.5 cups cooked)
1/2 tsp salt (, less or more depending on if the chickpeas are salted)
5 to 6 oz spinach
1  bunch  of cilantro (chopped, or use more spinach)
1/2 cup non dairy milk ( + 1 tbsp flour)

Instructions:
Remove the Puff pastry sheets from the freezer and cover and let them rest at room temperature. Roll them out a bit if you like (optikonal) (they should be ready in about 20 to 25 minutes to use. Prep and make the filling in the meanwhile).&nbsp;
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. When hot add onion and garlic and a pinch of salt. Cook until translucent. Add spices and mix well. Mash the chickpeas using a fork or a food processor and add to the skillet. Add salt and mix well. Cook for 4 minutes.
Add the greens and mix in. Cook for 2 minutes. Taste and adjust salt and flavor.
Mix the flour into the non dairy milk and add to the chickpeas. Cook for 2-3 minutes to bring to a boil and thicken. Let it cool for a few minutes. (This filling can be made ahead and used in the puff pastry, as a sandwich filling, or a dip with toasted pita. )
Spread the mixture on one puff pastry and place the other pastry sheet on top. Crimp the edges with a fork and use scissors to cut vents in. You can also make individual pastry pockets.
Bake at 400 degrees F for 20 to 24 mins for one large piece, 16 to 20 minutes for smaller. Let the pastry cool for 5 minutes, then slice and serve.&nbsp;
