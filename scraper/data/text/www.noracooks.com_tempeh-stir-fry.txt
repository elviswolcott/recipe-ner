Ingredients:
1/2 cup creamy peanut butter
3 tablespoons pure maple syrup (or agave)
2 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoons Thai red curry paste*
2 tablespoons seasoned rice vinegar
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger
1 teaspoon red pepper chili flakes
2-3 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced
(2) 8-ounce packages tempeh, cubed
3 cups bite sized broccoli florets
1/2 cup shredded carrots (1 carrot)
1/2 cup chopped roasted peanuts
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro, optional
cooked brown/white rice or noodles, for serving

Instructions:
In a medium bowl, whisk together all of the peanut sauce ingredients until smooth. Set aside.
In a large wok or skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium-high heat.
Add the onion and cook for about 2 minutes, stirring constantly until it starts to soften.
Now add the tempeh and stir fry for another 5 minutes, stirring frequently.
Remove the tempeh and onions from the skillet and set on a plate nearby.
Add the remaining olive oil and the broccoli and carrots. Stir fry for 3-4 minutes until crisp tender.
Return the tempeh and onions to the pan, along with the sauce. Stir to coat and cook for about 2 minutes.
Turn off the heat, sprinkle with chopped peanuts and cilantro, if desired. Serve over noodles or with rice.
