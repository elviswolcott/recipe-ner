pinch of salt
2  drops of vanilla

Mix the chia seeds in the water (or use orange juice). let sit to thicken for 15 mins, then spread at the bottom of the serving jars.
Toast the oats in skillet over medium heat for 3 to 4 mins. Add the sunflower seeds or nuts half way through. You want to the oats to get just slightly toasty and nutty. (You can skip the roasting if you like to keep the oats and nuts untoasted). Add to the jars.
