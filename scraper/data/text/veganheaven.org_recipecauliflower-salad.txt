Ingredients:
1  cauliflower
1 can chickpeas
3  tomatoes
4 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon paprika powder
3 teaspoons curry powder
1 cup unsweetened plant-based yogurt  ((coconut or soy yogurt))
3  green onions

Instructions:
Preheat your oven to 400 F. Cut the cauliflower into medium-sized florets. Drain and rinse the canned chickpeas. 
Line a baking tray with parchment paper and place the cauliflower and the chickpeas on top.  
Add the olive oil and 1 teaspoon paprika powder and 1 teaspoon curry powder. Stir until all of the cauliflower florets and the chickpeas are coated. 
Bake for 20 minutes at 400 F. Stir and bake for another 10 minutes. 
In the meantime, make the dressing. Place the plant-based yogurt and the curry powder (2 teaspoons) in a small bowl. Add salt and pepper.
Stir until well combined. 
Dice the tomatoes and cut the green onions into rings. 
Transfer the roasted cauliflower and chickpeas to a large bowl and add the tomatoes and the green onions. 
Add the dressing. 
Carefully stir with a wooden spoon. Add a bit of freshly chopped parsley and red pepper flakes on top if you want. Serve the salad immediately or store in the fridge for later.
