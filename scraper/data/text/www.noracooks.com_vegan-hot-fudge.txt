Ingredients:
1 can (13.5 oz) coconut cream
1/2 cup light corn syrup* (or brown rice syrup)
1/3 cup brown sugar, packed
1/8 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoons vegan butter
6 ounces vegan chocolate, finely chopped
4 tablespoons natural cocoa powder, sifted
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract

Instructions:
In a small pot (1 1/2 quarts), combine the coconut cream, corn syrup, brown sugar, salt and vegan butter. Warm over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the butter melts and the mixture begins to simmer.
Simmer for 1 minute, then reduce the heat to low-medium and stir in the chocolate until it melts.
Remove from heat and whisk the cocoa powder in until smooth.
Return the pot to heat (still low-medium) and cook for just about 30 seconds more, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and let cool. It will thicken as it cools so don&#39;t worry if it&#39;s not super thick right away.
Store leftover fudge sauce in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. You can reheat it in the microwave for 20-30 seconds or until warm, or reheat on the stovetop in a small pan.
