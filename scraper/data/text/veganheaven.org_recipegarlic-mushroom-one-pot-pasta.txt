Ingredients:
4  cloves of garlic, minced
1  onion, chopped
10.6 oz fettuccine ((300 gramm))
3 cups vegetable broth
1 1/2 cups unsweetened almond or soy milk
3 cups mushrooms, sliced
1 cup fresh spinach
1 cup frozen peas
1 teaspoon tapioca starch ((optional, but recommended. This makes the pasta creamy) )
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste
red pepper flakes, to taste (optional)

Instructions:
In a large pot, heat some oil and saut√© the onion for about 3 minutes. Then add the garlic and the mushrooms and cook everything for another 2-3 minutes on high heat.
Add the uncooked fettuccine, the vegetable broth, and the almond milk. Stir a couple of times and gently push the fettuccine in the liquid when they're soft enough (this might take a couple of minutes. Try not to break them when they're still too hard).
After 12 minutes of cooking, add the peas and cook the one pot pasta for another 8 minutes. Then stir in the spinach. If you're using tapioca starch, combine the starch with 1 tablespoon of water and whisk until well combined. Add to the pasta and season with salt, pepper, and if using red pepper flakes. Enjoy!
