Ingredients:
4  Russet potatoes, medium
Avocado oil spray
4 oz. soy curls ((1/2 package))
1 1/2 cups broth
1 teaspoon no-chicken bouillon
1 teaspoon avocado oil
1/2  onion (thinly sliced)
1/3 cup Primal Kitchen Jalapeño Buffalo sauce
1/3 cup almond crema ((cashew cream sauce or vegan cream cheese_)
1/4 cup sliced green onions
1  cup guacamole
1/2  cup sliced green onion
1/2 cup Almond crema
1/3 cup Buffalo sauce

Instructions:
Spray potatoes with avocado oil and place on air fryer rack or basket. Air fry for 45 - 50 minutes at 400F until the potatoes are tender.
While the potatoes are cooking, bring your broth to a boil in a small pot over high heat. Place the soy curls in a heat proof bowl and pour the broth on them. Using a large spoon, press down so the soy curls absorb all the liquid.
Once the soy curls cool down a bit, squeeze all the liquid you can out of them. Place a third of the soy curls in the blender and process on low, until the soy curls are shredded. Repeat with the rest of the soy curls.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and sauté until translucent. Stir in shredded soy curls and sauté until it browns slightly. Lower heat and add almond crema, Buffalo sauce, and green onions. Stir to combine. Season to taste. Remove from heat and set aside.
Remove potatoes from air fryer and let cool slightly. Cut in half horizontally and scoop out the insides leaving about 1/4 inch of potato on the skin.
Mash the potato insides with a fork and mix them in with the soy curl mixture.
Spray the potato skins with avocado oil and air fry them for 15 min, flipping them half way through.
Fill the potato skins with the Buffalo soy curls and place under the oven broiler for 2 minutes. Top with almond crema, guacamole, green onions, and Buffalo sauce.
