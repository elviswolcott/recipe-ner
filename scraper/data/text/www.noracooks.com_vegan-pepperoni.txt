Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups vital wheat gluten flour
1/4 cup nutritional yeast
1 tablespoon smoked paprika
2 teaspoons fennel seed
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
3/4 cup water
1/4 cup tomato paste
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons soy sauce

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.
In a large bowl, mix together all the dry ingredients.&nbsp;
In a smaller bowl, whisk all the wet ingredients together until well combined.
Pour the wet into the dry ingredients and mix with a large spoon until it comes together. It will be like a dough that is pretty rough at this point.
Turn the dough onto a work surface and knead until smooth. Break into 3 sections and shape each section into logs about 2 inches in diameter.&nbsp;
Wrap tightly in aluminum foil, twisting the ends to secure.
Bake for 60 minutes, placing the foil-wrapped logs directly on the oven racks.&nbsp;
Remove from oven, unwrap and let cool for 5-10 minutes. Slice the pepperoni very thin, or thicker if desired. Store extra pepperoni in an air tight container or plastic wrap.&nbsp;
