Ingredients:
1/2 lb. (1 1/4 cups) Brown or green lentils, cleaned, rinsed
8 cups Water or vegetable stock
1/2  White onion
1  Bay leaf, (dry)
1/2  White onion, (diced)
2  Roma tomato, (diced)
2  Garlic cloves, (minced)
1  Chile serrano
4 springs Cilantro

Instructions:
Place your lentils in a medium sauce pot, add water, onion, and bay leaf. Bring to a low simmer and let cook for 20 minutes.
While the lentils are cooking, make a small incision using a sharp knife on the tip of the serrano pepper (like an X). Set a large saut√© pan to medium heat and add the diced onion. Let the onions cook until translucent and tender,  about 4-5 minutes. If it begins to stick to the pan add a little bit of water.
Add garlic and cook for 1 more minute. Add diced tomato and chile serrano (whole) and cook until the tomato has broken down, about 6 minutes.
Remove the  onion and bay leaf from the lentils, and add the vegetable mixture, and cilantro sprigs to the pot. Simmer slowly for about 8 minutes.
Remove the cilantro sprigs, and serrano pepper. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Cut the chile serrano into rounds and add it back to the pot to make the soup extra spicy. (optional)
