Ingredients:
1/2 cup raw cashews
1/3 cup water
3 tbsp vegan cream cheese ((I use kite hill almond). See notes for subs)
3 tbsp sugar ((cane, coconut or other, or use maple syrup)
1/4 tsp salt
4 tbsp fine almond flour
1 tbsp coconut flour
4 tbsp vegan powdered sugar
seeds from 2 cardamom pods (,crushed coarsely)
1/8 tsp ground cardamom
1 tsp oil or vegan butter (, omit for oilfree)

Instructions:
Soak the cashews for atleast an hour.
Drain and blend with 1/3 cup water until smooth. Add the cream cheese, sugar and salt and blend again until smooth.
Transfer to a skillet. Use 2 tbsp water to rinse out the blender and add to the skillet. Cook over medium low heat for 10 mins, stir occasionally. The mixture will get lumpy then evenly thicken.
Add the flours, sugar and mix in. Continue to cook for another 10 mins.
Fold in the cardamom and oil and continue to cook until the mixture starts to leave the pan (see pic above).
Cool, then chill for an hour before shaping into balls. Coat in shredded coconut if you wish. Serve chilled.
Refrigerate for upto 4 days and freeze for upto a month.
