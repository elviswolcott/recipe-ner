Ingredients:
1 tsp oil
4 cloves of garlic (, minced)
14 to 16 oz tomato sauce, (marinara, pizza sauce or tomato puree)
1.5 tsp italian herbs ((thyme, oregano, basil, use less or more depending on sauce used)
1/4 tsp  salt ((less or more depending on if the tomato sauce is salted or not))
1/4 tsp  pepper flakes
2 cups uncooked Ziti or other pasta such as penne (, 6 oz or 200 gm)
1.25  cup water (, 1.5 cups if the sauce used is thicker)
2 tsp extra virgin olive oil
1/8 tsp white pepper
vegan parm as needed (, vegan mozzarella (optional))
fresh basil or herbs as needed

Instructions:
Start the Instant Pot on saute. Add oil and garlic and cook until the garlic is starting to get golden. (see saucepan instructions in notes)
Add the tomato sauce, herbs, pepper flakes and salt and mix in. Switch off saute. Add pasta and water and mix well to dislodge any stuck bits. Press the pasta into the sauce so the pasta is well covered in the sauce.Alternatively, add water, veggies if using, herbs, salt and mix in. Then add tomato sauce on top and pasta and press just to cover the pasta but dont mix. (some IPs are more prone to burn errors that others so try both to see which works. Also see tips above)
Close the lid and pressure cook for 6 mins. (4 to 7 mins depending on the pasta used).&nbsp;Quick release after 4 mins.
Add white pepper, olive oil , vegan parm, or vegan mozzarella and mix in.&nbsp;Garnish with more parm and fresh herbs.
For tomato cream sauce, add 1/3 cup cashew cream and some nutritional yeast and mix in. Saute to bring to just a boil. Garnish and serve
