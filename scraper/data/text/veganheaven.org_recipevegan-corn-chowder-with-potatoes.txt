Ingredients:
3  medium-sized russet potatoes, cut into cubes
1  red bell pepper, cut into medium-sized chunks
5 cups corn kernels (either fresh or frozen)
2  stalks of celery, chopped
1  onion, finely chopped
2  carrots, sliced
2  bay leaves
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika powder
1/2 teaspoon Cajun seasoning (optional) (Omit if you don't want the corn chowder to be a bit spicy! )
4 cups vegetable broth
1 cup coconut milk
1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste
1  green onion, cut into rings
1/2 cup fresh parsley, chopped

Instructions:
Cut all the vegetables in bite-sized chunks or slices. Put 2 cups of the corn in a blender together with the coconut milk and the almond milk. Blend until smooth. Set aside.
In a large pot, saut√© the onion in some oil until it becomes translucent. Then, add the vegetables, the spices, the bay leaves, the vegetable broth, and the pureed corn. Bring to boil and cook for about 15 minutes or until the vegetables are tender.
Discard bay leaves. Season with salt and pepper and sprinkle with the green onion and the fresh parsley. I like this corn chowder best with warm whole wheat baguette.
