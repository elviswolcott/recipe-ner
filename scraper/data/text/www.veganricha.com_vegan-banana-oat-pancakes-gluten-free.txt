Ingredients:
1  medium ripe banana
1 cup old fashioned oats (, certified gluten-free if needed)
3 tbsp almond flour (, (or other nut flour or pumpkin seed flour - i havent tested with these))
1 tbsp tapioca starch (, or cornstarch )
1 tsp baking powder
1/8 tsp salt
1/2 tsp cinnamon or vanilla extract (, or other spice blends of choice such as pumpkin pie spice or chai spice)
1 tsp lemon juice
3/4 cup non dairy milk such as almond milk (, soy milk, light coconut milk or oat milk)

Instructions:
Add everything to a blender. Blend everything for a minute. Add a tbsp maple syrup for sweeter if you like. Let sit for 5 mins, then blend again until smooth.
Heat a thick bottom skillet over medium heat. Grease if needed. Add a ladleful of the batter. Cook for 2 tot 3 minutes, cover the pan to help keep the moisture in and cook the pancakes faster. When the pancake batter gets bubbly, slip and cook for another 2 mins. (Cooking time varies with pans and stoves)
Stack and serve immediately with maple syrup, vegan butter, fruits or toasted nuts.
Variations: Add spices or blends of choice for flavor, add some candied fruits, chocolate chips or nuts to the batter for variation
