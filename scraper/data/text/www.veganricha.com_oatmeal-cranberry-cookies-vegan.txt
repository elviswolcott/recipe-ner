Ingredients:
3/4 cup oats
1/8 cup (2 tablespoons) self rising flour
1/4 cup whole wheat pastry flour
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon powder
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg powder ((can add some cloves or all spice as well))
4 tablespoons granulated raw sugar ((1-2 Tbsps more if you want sweeter cookies))
2 tablespoons agave syrup
3 tablespoons oil
1 teaspoon flax seed meal
1 tablespoon warm water
1 teaspoon orange or lime juice
1/2 cup or more dried cranberries

Instructions:
Mix 1 teaspoon flax seed meal with 1-2 teaspoons of warm water till well blended into a paste and not dry.
In a large bowl, blend together oil , agave syrup and sugar using an electric mixer for 2-3 minutes.&nbsp;
Add in the flax meal mixture and blend again til the sugar does not look granulated and the mixture is a bit fluffy. It wont be fluffy like butter and sugar mix, but will feel lighter.
In a separate bowl, mix in the flours, oats, spices and salt and mix well.
Add into the the sugar mixture and mix a bit. If the mixture appears too dry, add in a teaspoon or 2 of orange juice or lime juice,. I used orange juice. Or if the mixture is runny, add in some whole wheat pastry flour 1 teaspoon at a time.
Add in the dried cranberries and mix until just about combined well.
Keep mixture in the refrigerator for half an hour.
Spoon mixture on baking sheet an inch apart. You can make balls for a defined cookie shape as well. I placed them on parchment paper on a baking sheet.
Bake at preheated 350 degrees F for 15-17 minutes. a few minutes more or less depending on the oven and the size of the dough balls. The cookies should start browning on the edges and the center should be soft, but not liquid/runny. They might look liquidy but it is just the oily shine, so check by inserting a toothpick or thin knife in the center.
Cool on rack for 10-15 mins before finishing them off!
