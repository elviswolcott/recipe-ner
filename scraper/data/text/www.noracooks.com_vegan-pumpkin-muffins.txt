Ingredients:
15  ounce can pumpkin puree
1/3 cup melted vegan butter OR vegetable oil
1/2 cup soy or almond milk, unsweetened
1 1/4 cups brown sugar, lightly packed
1 3/4 cups all purpose flour
1  tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 cup non-dairy chocolate chips, raisins, cranberries or chopped walnuts

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and lightly grease a muffin pan. If you use paper liners, also make sure to spray the cups lightly with oil so the muffins don't get stuck to the paper.
In a large mixing bowl, add the pumpkin, melted vegan butter (or oil), non-dairy milk and brown sugar. Whisk until well combined and smooth.
Sift the flour, baking powder, salt and spices over the wet mixture (I use a fine mesh strainer for this or use a sifter).
Mix the dry ingredients into the wet gently using a large wooden spoon until just combined, being careful not to over mix.
Fold in any optional ingredients, if using, and fill the muffin cups full. Bake for 22-25 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. Enjoy!
