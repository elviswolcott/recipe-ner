Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup almond flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup agave or maple syrup
1  banana, mashed
1 cup vanilla-flavored soy yogurt
1 cup blueberries
1/4 cup almond milk
about 6 tablespoons vanilla-flavored soy yogurt
2 teaspoons lemon zest
1/4 cup blueberries

Instructions:
In a medium bowl, combine all ingredients except the blueberries. Stir with a wooden spoon until well combined.
Add the blueberries and use a spatula or spoon to gently fold the blueberries into the muffin batter.
Place baking cups in a muffin pan and divide the mixture evenly.
Bake for about 20 minutes at 360F. Let the muffins cool down for about half an hour.
Top with more soy yogurt, lemon zest, and blueberries if you want or just enjoy them by themselves.
