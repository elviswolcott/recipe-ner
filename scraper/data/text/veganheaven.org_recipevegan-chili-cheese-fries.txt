Instructions:
Preheat your oven to 350 °F. Cut the potatoes into french fries and bake them for about 30 minutes until they're crispy.
In the meantime, make the chili. Heat some oil in a large pan and sauté the onion for about 2 minutes. Then add the garlic and cook it for one more minute. Add the the tomato paste, the chili and paprika powder, and cook for 2 minutes. Now add the liquid smoke (if using), the cumin, the diced tomatoes, the oregano, the kidney beans, the black beans, and the corn. Simmer for 10 minutes.
Make the vegan cheese sauce: Combine all ingredients in a high speed blender and blend until smooth and creamy.
Once the fries are ready, add the chili and the cheese on top and bake for another 10 minutes. Serve with green onions, fresh cilantro, and black onions.
