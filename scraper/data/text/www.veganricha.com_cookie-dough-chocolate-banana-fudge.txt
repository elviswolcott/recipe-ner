mash the bananas really well or blend them.
Add the mashed banana to a pan with the maple syrup and cook for 4 to 5 minutes until bubbly.
Remove from heat. Add vanilla and chocolate let sit for a minute then whisk until the chocolate melts fully and the mixture is smooth. Taste carefully and add ground sugar if you like it sweeter and mix in. You might not need any if you use semi sweet chocolate chips.
Drop batter on parchment and spread with a spatula. Place cookie dough balls and press in.
