Using the Saute function on Instant Pot, saute onion, garlic, and rice in the olive oil for 1-2 minutes, until fragrant.&nbsp;
Add the Rotel, salt and water (or vegetable broth). Stir together. Now, seal Instant Pot and cook on high pressure for 24 minutes. Once complete, allow the pressure to come down naturally.
