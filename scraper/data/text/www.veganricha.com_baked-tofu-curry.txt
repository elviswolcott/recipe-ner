Ingredients:
2 tsp oil (divided)
14 oz firm or extra firm tofu (pressed and cubed small)
3/4 cups chopped onions
3 cloves garlic (minced)
1 tsp minced ginger
1  hot green chili such as serrano or thai minced (Or use mild )
2 tsp ground coriander
1/2 -1 tsp ground cumin
1/2 tsp ground cardamom
1/4 tsp black pepper
1/4-1/3 tsp cayenne (or Indian red chili powder )
2  bay leaves
1/2 tsp dried fenugreek leaves (optional)
16 oz tomato puree
14 oz  coconut milk (or 1 1/4 cup of cashew milk)
3/4 tsp salt
cilantro for garnish

Instructions:
Brush the oil all over a large baking dish. Add the pressed and cubed Tofu to 1 side of the baking dish, and toss well to coat with some of the oil.
On the other side of the baking dish, add the onion, garlic, ginger, chili, and all of the spices, and a good pinch of salt, and mix well to coat. You can add a few sprinkles of water and mix so the spices and oil are evenly distributed on the onion. Then bake at 400 degrees F (205 c) for 12-15 minutes, or until the onion is golden and the tofu is slightly crisp on the sides.
Take the baking dish out of the oven, and add in the tomato puree, canned coconut milk, and salt, and mix well, then even it out with a spatula. Put it back in the oven to bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened to preference. Sauce will be more viscous when hot but thickens on cooking
Take the dish out of the oven, garnish witb cilantro , some coconut cream, and serve with rice or flat bread. You can also add in some vegan butter just before serving.
