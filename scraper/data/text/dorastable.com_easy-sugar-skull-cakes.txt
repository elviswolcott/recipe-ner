Ingredients:
6 tbsp. Chickpea Flour
6 tbsp. Water
1 box Duncan Hines Moist Red Velvet Cake Mix
1/3 cup Vegetable Oil
1 ¼ cups Water
1 lb. Vanilla Rolled Fondant
½ cup Cornstarch
1  Duncan Hines Whipped Vanilla Frosting
Gel food coloring
Gel writing icing pens

Instructions:
Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease cake pan.
In a small bowl combine the chickpea flour and 6 tbsp. of water and mix well. Place the Duncan Hines cake mix in a large bowl and add the chickpea flour mixture, vegetable oil, and water. Mix well with a whisk until combined.
Pour cake batter into cake pan and bake for 20 to 25 min. or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Remove cake from over and let cool for 5 minutes in pan. Invert cake pan onto a rack and let cakes full off completely.
Roll your fondant into 6 small balls about 3 inched wide. Sprinkle your counter with cornstarch and roll out fondant until ¼ inch thick.
Spread a thin layer of icing on the skull cakes and place fondant on top. Use your fingers to smooth out the fondant and fill the crevices of the skull. Tuck the fondant under the cake. Repeat this process with the rest if the cakes.
Place 1/8 tsp. of your favorite gel food coloring in small bowls dilute with about 1 -2 tsp. of water.
Now comes the best part!! Paint your skulls with a paintbrush and the gel food coloring or with icing writing pens. Let icing paint dry then eat.
