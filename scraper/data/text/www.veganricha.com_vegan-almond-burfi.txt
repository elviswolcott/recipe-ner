Ingredients:
1/2 cup sugar (, I use cane sugar )
1/4 cup water
4-6  strands of saffron
1/8 teaspoon of salt
1.5 cups almond flour
1 teaspoon vegan butter
Chopped raw pistachios for garnish
Almond slivers for garnish

Instructions:
Line a 9 x5 loaf pan with parchment and keep ready. In a non stick skillet, add the sugar, water, saffron and salt and mix over medium heat.
Bring to a rolling boil and mix well until the sugar dissolves. Continue to simmer for 2 mins, then add in the almond flour, and vegan butter and mix well. Press and mix so that all of the almond flour gets hydrated with the sugar syrup.
Cook until the mixture comes together and leaves sides of the pan and then immediately take the pan off the heat. This takes 1-3 mins depending on your pan and stove heating
Transfer to a parchment lined 9X5 loaf pan, place another parchment on top and spread the mixture and even it out by pressing with a spatula.
Remove the top parchment. Press in the pistachios and almond slivers into the Burfi and use a knife to score your pieces so that they are easier to slice afterwards. Chill the Burfi for half an hour and then slice with a sharp knife and store.
