Ingredients:
1 tsp oil
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper
1 15 oz can chickpeas or 1.5 cups cooked
1 tbsp Annie Chun's gochujang sauce (or other gochujang paste. Or use other hot sauces as asian chile sauce or sriracha)
2 tsp soy sauce (use certified gf if needed)
1 tsp rice vinegar
1/4 tsp sesame oil
1 tsp sugar or other sweetener
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/4 cup water
paprika or cayenne for more color/heat
Cucumber or celery for topping

Instructions:
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onions and a pinch of salt and cook until translucent. You can also cook them in broth.
Add the bell pepper and chickpeas and all the ingredients through water. Cover and cook for 6 to 7 minutes.
Mash some of the chickpeas. Taste and adjust salt, spice and sweet. Add salt to taste, if the chickpeas were not salted. At this point you can add in chopped veggies like broccoli, celery, carrots or other crunchy veggies.
Add paprika or cayenne to preference and mix in (optional and not needed if using hot gochujang paste). Cook for another 2 minutes or until most of the saucy liquid gets absorbed.
Serve in lettuce with cooling veggies as sliced cucumber, shredded carrots. If the chickpeas are too hot, serve with creamy dressing as vegan ranch or garlic sauce
