2 cloves laung
2  dried red chilles
1 teaspoon coriander powder
1 teaspoon cumin powder
1/2 teaspoon pomegranate seed powder or rock salt

1 teaspoon chole masala (optional, I did not use it. Chole fanatics probably cant live without it!)

Instructions:
In a blender, add 3 tomatoes, 4 cloves garlic, 3/4 of the chopped ginger, 2 green chillies and 1/2 can garbanzo beans.
Puree the contents and keep aside.
In a large pan, heat the oil and add all the spices ( red chillies, bay leaves, powders etc).
Let them roast on medium heat for 3 minutes.
Add the puree to the pan and let simmer for 15-20 minutes until the puree thickens and starts to leave the sides of the pan.
Pressure cook the garbanzo beans for at least 2 whistles.
In the large pan with the puree, add the coriander leaves, the remaining ginger, cooked garbanzo beans, 1 chopped tomato, salt and sugar and water. you can add chopped red, green bell pepper too!
Let this simmer for 10 minutes covered on medium heat.
Garnish with some lemon juice and chopped white onion.
Serve hot with rotis, puris!!
