Ingredients:
1 block of medium-firm tofu
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 tablespoon olive oil (optional)
1/2 cup ketchup
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 tablespoons distilled vinegar
2 tablespoons sugar
5  fresh lychees, peeled & halved, then cored
1/2  scallion, for topping

Instructions:
Prepare the Tofu. For this recipe, we’re working with twice frozen and thawed tofu. As the name suggests, the tofu has been frozen, thawed, frozen again, and completely thawed again (all within its original container). After the second thaw, use a heavy object or a tofu press to weigh the tofu down for at least 15 minutes, pressing out as much liquid as possible. At the end of the pressing, the height of the tofu should have halved. Using your fingers, pull away chunks of tofu (I think about sphere/square-ish chunks) — the goal is to get them to look naturally torn. Place the tofu chunks in a bowl with cornstarch and carefully toss to evenly coat.
Bake the Tofu. Pre-heat the oven to 420 degrees F (215 C). Arrange tofu chunks in a single layer on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Optional: Drizzle with ~1 tablespoon of olive oil for better color & crispiness. Bake tofu for 20-22 minutes, depending on the size of the chunks, or until crispy & golden-brown.
Make the Sauce & Finish. Heat up 1 tablespoon oil in a non-stick pan on medium-heat. Add ketchup, distilled vinegar, sugar, and stir to combine and cook for 1-2 minutes. Taste the sauce and add more sugar (to lower acidity) if necessary, but note that the addition of lychee will bring considerable sweetness. Turn off the heat and add back the crispy tofu along with halved lychees. Toss together & heat through with residual heat for 1 minute. Finish with a sprinkle of scallions. Serve warm with rice.
