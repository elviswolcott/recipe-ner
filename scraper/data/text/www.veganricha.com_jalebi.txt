Ingredients:
1 cup sugar
3/4 cup water
pinch of cardamom powder
pinch of saffron strands crushed
1 cup all purpose flour
just about 1/2 cup luke warm water
1 Tablespoon non dairy Yogurt
1/2 teaspoon quick rise yeast
2 teaspoons sugar
pinch of saffron crushed
orange food color (optional.. I did not use color)
Oil for frying

Instructions:
To prepare the sugar syrup, Boil all the ingredients till the syrup comes to a boil and thickens a bit. (2-3 minutes after the syrup boils). You can add other flavors to the syrup like kewra essence or rose water/essence instead of cardamom.
For the Jalebi batter, In a bowl, add warm water, sugar, saffron and yeast and mix well.
Keep the mixture for 10 minutes or until it is frothy.
Add in the flour, non dairy yogurt and mix well to make a smooth pouring consistency mixture without lumps.
Cover bowl with plastic wrap and keep for an hour.
Pour the mixture into a squeezy bottle or a zip-lock bag and cut a small hole(1/8 inch) on one side of the ziplock bag,
Heat oil in a kadhai or deep pan over medium heat until hot. Starting from the center, squeeze out the batter in circles to make a big concentric circle.
Fry it on medium high heat on both sides, till the Jalebies turn golden brown. (*Authentic Jalebis are meant to be fried in ghee(clarified butter), like are you kidding me, 2 cups of ghee is probably from 100s of gallons of milk! )
Transfer Jalebis to warm sugar syrup and remove after half a minute.
Serve warm or cold as is or topped with Vegan Rabdi!
