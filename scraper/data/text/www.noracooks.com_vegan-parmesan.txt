Ingredients:
1  cup raw cashews, walnuts or pepitas
1/3 cup nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon salt

Instructions:
Add all ingredients to a food processor, and pulse until a crumbly consistency is reached. Don't pulse for too long or it will turn into a paste.
Store vegan parmesan cheese in the refrigerator for several weeks; it lasts quite a long time. Use it on pizza, pasta, tofu scramble, roasted vegetables and anywhere else you like.
