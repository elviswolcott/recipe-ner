Ingredients:
1/2 cup + 1 tbsp non dairy milk (, boiling hot)
1/4 cup cocoa
1/4 cup applesauce
3 tbsp oil (or use more non dairy milk)
1 tsp vinegar ( or lemon juice)
1/3 to 1/2 cup brown sugar (or cane sugar + 1 tbsp molasses (1/3 cup if using semi sweet chocolate))
2 tsp minced fresh ginger (optional)
1.25 to 1.5 cups flour ((I use a mix of all purpose and whole wheat))
1.5 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
1.5 tsp gingerbread spice (,less or more to preference (or 3/4 tsp ground ginger, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, dashed of ground cloves, nutmeg))
1/4 cup chopped vegan chocolate (, dark or semi sweet or a mix)
1/3 cup chopped candied ginger
2 tbsp mini chocolate chips for topping (optional)

Instructions:
Grease or line a loaf pan with parchment. Preheat the oven to 350 deg F (180 C).
In a bowl, mix the hot non dairy milk and cocoa until combined.&nbsp;Add the rest of the wet ingredients and mix well.
Add 1 cup flour, spices, salt, baking powder and baking soda to the wet. Mix the dry ingredients lightly before combining into the wet.Â (Or alternatively, mix in another bowl and then add to the wet)
Add the chocolate, candied ginger and 1/4 cup flour and mix in to make a muffin like batter. Add more flour if too flowy. This batter is good to bake into muffins, mini loafs or cake pan. If baking a large loaf, add a few tbsp more flour until the batter is stiff, and then drop into prepared loaf pan. Use a clean spoon or spatula to even it out.
Sprinkle mini chocolate chips on top if desired. Bake for 45 mins. Check with&nbsp; a toothpick from the middle. (muffin 22 min, shallow cake pan 35 mins)
Cool for 10 mins then remove from pan. Cool to room temp before slicing.&nbsp;Serve warm (warm to melt the chocolate if already cooled) as a snack or top with whipped coconut cream or a chocolate frosting for dessert.&nbsp;
