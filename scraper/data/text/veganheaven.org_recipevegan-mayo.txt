Ingredients:
1/2 cup unsweetened soy milk
1  cup canola oil
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
1 pinch of black pepper
1 pinch of salt

Instructions:
Place all the ingredients in a blender except for the oil. Blend for about 10 seconds or until everything is combined.
Then turn the blender to low and gradually add the oil (while the blender is still going on low). The easiest way to do this is to remove the lid plug (the little plastic plug in the middle of the lid) and pour the oil through it. 
When you&#x27;re done adding all of the oil, put the lid plug back on and turn the blender to high until the vegan mayo is thick enough for your liking.
