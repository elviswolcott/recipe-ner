Ingredients:
1 1/2 cup flour (I use half oat and half white)
3/4 cup almond flour  (or meal)
1 tbsp coconut sugar
3 tbsp oil
1/3 tsp salt
3 tbsp maple syrup
1/4 tsp cinnamon
2 tbsp flax seed meal
4 tbsp warm water
2 cups pumpkin puree ((cooked and pureed pumpkin, not pumpkin pie mix))
3 tbsp cornstarch
1/2 to 1 tsp vanilla
2 tsp pumpkin pie spice ((1.5 tsp cinnamon, a good dash of nutmeg, all spice, ginger))
1/4 cup maple syrup
1/4 cup raw or light brown sugar
a good pinch of salt
1/2 cup coconut cream (the thick separated cream from a can of full fat coconut milk, or use full fat coconut milk)

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F / 180c. Add the flours, almond meal, coconut sugar and oil to a bowl and mix well until the oil is distributed.
Add salt, maple, cinnamon and mix in.
Mix flax meal in the water and let it sit for 5 minutes. Add to the flours and mix well. The mixture should start to stick and come together like a slightly crumbly dough. If it is too crumbly, add some more maple syrup.
Grease the pie pan lightly with oil. Press the mixture into a pie pan into a thin even crust. Bake for 6 to 7 minutes.
Whisk the all the ingredients under filling except coconut cream until well combined. Warm the coconut cream if solid and mix in. Taste and adjust spice if needed.
Pour into crust and spread with a spatula.
Bake for 55 to 60 minutes or until the center is not liquidy. Chill for at least 3 hours. Slice and serve with whipped coconut cream or vanilla ice cream.
