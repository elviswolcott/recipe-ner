Ingredients:
3  tomatoes
1  avocado
1  clove of garlic, minced
1/2 small red onion, chopped
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup basil, chopped
sea salt
black pepper, to taste
10 slices rustic bread or baguette
1  clove of garlic, to rub the bread
2-3 tablespoons balsamic reduction

Instructions:
Dice the tomatoes and the avocado into small cubes and place in a bowl with the red onion, the olive oil, and the chopped basil. Season with salt and pepper.
Either roast the bread in a pan (I like using a griddle pan) or put them on the grill. Rub the hot slices of bread with the garlic.
Equally divide the tomato avocado topping on the bread and drizzle with the balsamic reduction.
