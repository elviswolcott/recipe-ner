Ingredients:
1/2 cup shredded coconut (dried)
1/4 cup almond meal
1 cup or more mango puree (thick puree from can or ripe mango)
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp nutritional yeast (optional - it adds a bit of khoya kind of flavor profile which is in dairy based ladoos)
sugar or other sweetener if needed
1 tbsp coconut flour
1 tbsp cornstarch or other starch
shredded coconut for garnish

Instructions:
Add coconut, almond meal and pureed mango to a saucepan over medium heat. Cook for 7 to 8 minutes until bubbling away.
Add the salt, nutritional yeast. Taste and add sugar or sweetener if needed. At this point you can also add other ground nuts or seeds or protein powder.
Mix starch into the coconut flour really well and add to the mixture. Mix in really well and cook for 8 to 10 minutes. Continue to cook until the mixture becomes stiff and leaves the sides of the pan. The cooking time depends on the moisture in the mango puree.
Chill the mixture in the refrigerator for half an hour. Shape into balls or press into parchment lined loaf to cut into bars. Roll the balls in shredded coconut. Store on the counter for the day, or refrigerate for upto 5 days.
