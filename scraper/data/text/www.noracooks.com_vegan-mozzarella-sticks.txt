Ingredients:
1 Recipe Shreddable Vegan Mozzarella (OR a block of store bought vegan mozzarella)
1/4 cup all purpose flour
1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 cup fine breadcrumbs
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
peanut or vegetable oil, for frying
marinara sauce, for serving

Instructions:
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Prepare a batch of Shreddable Vegan Mozzarella, or get out another store bought vegan mozzarella block, and cut into sticks 2-3 inches long, 1/2 inch wide.
Gather 3 shallow bowls. In the first, add the flour. In the second, whisk the almond milk and cornstarch. In the third, stir the breadcrumbs, Italian seasoning and garlic powder together.
Dip each cheese stick into the flour to coat, then into the milk/cornstarch, then into the bowl with the breadcrumbs and pat to coat the cheese stick. Use one hand for the dry bowls, and your other hand for the wet bowl.
Place onto the lined baking sheet and place in the freezer for at least 1 hour. This is so that the cheese wonâ€™t melt before the crumbs get crispy! Overnight works as well.
To fry: After freezing, get out a large pot and fill it with oil 2-3 inches deep. Use a thermometer to make sure the oil is heated to 350 degrees F, then place the cheese sticks in the oil and fry for 2-3 minutes until golden brown. Remove from oil and place on a paper towel lined plate.
Or bake: After freezing, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Remove the pan from the freezer and spray the tops of the sticks with oil. Bake for about 8-10 minutes until the cheese is warm and the outside is golden.
Serve with marinara sauce for dipping and enjoy!
