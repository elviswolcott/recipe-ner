Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
(1) 16-ounce block firm tofu
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
1/2 teaspoon salt, or more to taste
1/4 teaspoon turmeric
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
2 tablespoons non-dairy milk, unsweetened and unflavored

Instructions:
Heat the olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Mash the block of tofu right in the pan, with a potato masher or a fork. You can also crumble it into the pan with your hands. Cook, stirring frequently, for 3-4 minutes until the water from the tofu is mostly gone.
Now add the nutritional yeast, salt, turmeric and garlic powder. Cook and stir constantly for about 5 minutes.
Pour the non-dairy milk into the pan, and stir to mix. Serve immediately with sliced avocado, hot sauce, parsley, steamed kale, toast or any other breakfast item.
