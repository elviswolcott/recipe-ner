Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegan butter
2 (15-ounce) cans hearts of palm, drained
salt + pepper, to taste
4 tablespoons vegan butter
5 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup dry white wine (or vegetable broth)
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
salt + pepper, to taste
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
8 ounces angel hair pasta

Instructions:
Slice the hearts of palm into 1/2 inch thick rounds (these are your vegan scallops.)
Cook the pasta according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.
In a large pan (non stick or cast iron preferred), add 2 tablespoons of vegan butter over medium-high heat. Once sizzling, add the hearts of palm in a single layer without overcrowding the pan. If needed, do a couple of batches.
Sprinkle with a little salt + pepper, and fry for 2-3 minutes on each side until a golden crust forms underneath.
Flip them and fry again for 2-3 minutes until golden brown on both sides. Remove from the skillet and transfer to a plate nearby.
In the same skillet, melt 4 tablespoons of vegan butter. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Pour in the wine (or broth) and bring to a simmer for about 2 minutes.
Now stir in the lemon juice and add salt + pepper, to taste. Turn off the heat and add the vegan scallops to the sauce. Garnish with fresh chopped parsley.
Serve over cooked angel hair pasta, with enough sauce to coat the noodles. Enjoy!
