Ingredients:
2/3 cup blueberries
1/3 cup chopped apple
4 tablespoons raw sugar or jaggery grated
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon powder
3-4 tablespoons water
1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour
2/3 cup self rising flour (or all purpose flour + 1/2 teaspoon baking powder)
1 tablespoon flax seed meal or flax seeds coarsely ground
3 tablespoons Oats
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon white vinegar
1 tablespoon raw sugar
1 tablespoon high fat oil (I used virgin coconut oil)
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup warm water

Instructions:
You can prepare the compote beforehand and keep. Blend the blueberries, apple, sugar and cinnamon in a blender into a smooth puree. use a little water if needed.
Cook this puree on low heat till it thickens to a thick syrup consistency. about 15-20 minutes.
In a large bowl, add flax meal, vinegar, oil, and 1/4 (60ml) cup almost hot water.
Mix it well till the mixture is well combined. Add in the oats and sugar, mix well and keep aside for a few minutes.
In a bowl, mix the flours, salt, baking powder.
Add the fruit syrup and the flours to the flax meal mixture. Mix lightly.
If the mixture seems too dry, add in a few tablespoons water at a time. Mix until just about combined like a muffin batter.
Grease a mini loaf well. Drop batter in and even it out.
Bake in preheated oven at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until the toothpick inserted in the Middle comes out clean.
Let cool a little before removing from pan and slicing! Serve warm as is, or topped with blueberry compote or the strawberry orange one in the pictures.:)
