Ingredients:
1/2 cup smooth peanut butter
1/3 cup maple syrup
2 tbsp warmed non dairy milk (, such as almond, soy or coconut)
1 tsp vanilla extract
3/4 cup old fashioned oats (, use certified gluten-free if needed)
3/4 cup flour (, I use a mix of all purpose and wheat. Use Oat flour or gf blend for glutenfree)
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/3 tsp salt
1/3 cup vegan chocolate chips (, use dried fruit like raisins, currants, blueberries or cranberries for no chocolate)

Instructions:
Line a baking sheet with parchment. Preheat the oven to 350 deg F ( 180 C)&nbsp;
Mix the peanut butter, maple, warmed non dairy milk and vanilla until smooth. it will take a minute to combine. (The warm milk will help the nut butter mix in more easily).
Mix the baking soda and salt into 1/2 cup flour. Add the mixed flour and oats to the nut butter bowl and mix well. Add spices such as cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice if you wish
Add more flour if the mixture is too sticky. Depends on the flour and the nut butter. I need 2 to 4 tbsp more * .Fold in the chocolate chips.&nbsp;
Bring the dough together. Use a 1.5 tbsp cookie scooop and scoop onto parchment lined baking sheet.&nbsp;
Press each scoop down to flatten. Add some chocolate chips on top if needed.
Bake at 350 F for 12 to 14 mins, longer for crispier. Cool for 5 mins, then remove from the pan and cool completely.Store on the counter for upto 5 days. Refrigerate for freshness for upto 2 weeks.&nbsp;
