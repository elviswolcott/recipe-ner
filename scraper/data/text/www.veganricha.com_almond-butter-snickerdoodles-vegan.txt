Ingredients:
3/4 cup organic unbleached white flour or Spelt flour (or use glutenfree all purpose flour)
1 Tbsp corn starch (or arrowroot starch)
1/3 cup raw sugar (finely ground or any other fine vegan sugar)
1/4 tsp baking powder
1/8 tsp baking soda
1/8 tsp salt
2 tsps flaxmeal
2 Tbsp almond milk
3 Tbsp almond butter (I used Justin's classic almond butter)
3 Tbsp Oil (organic canola or virgin coconut)
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1/4 tsp cinnamon powder
2 Tbsps sugar (coarsely ground raw sugar)
3 tsps cinnamon

Instructions:
In a bowl, whisk all the dry ingredients:
In another bowl mix the flaxmeal into the milk. Add the almond butter, oil, vanilla, cinnamon and mix well to combine. It will take a minute or so for the nut butter to mix in. Add this mixture to the dry and mix. Knead to form a stiff dough. The mixture will feel crumbly at first but will come together. If it just doesnt stay together, spray water on it once or twice and knead. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for an hour.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F / 190c. Mix 2 tsps cinnamon in 2 Tablespoons sugar in a bowl and put 1 tsp cinnamon in another small plate or bowl. Make an inch to inch and half size balls of the chilled dough. Roll the ball first in cinnamon then in cinnamon sugar. Place on parchment lined sheet. Press down with a fork. Bake for 11-12 minutes. Let cool completely.(5 minutes). The cookies will be soft out of the oven, but will firm up. Store in an airtight container.
