Ingredients:
12 ounces silken tofu
1 1/2 cups dairy free chocolate chips
2 tablespoons almond milk
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 recipe Easy Vegan Pie Crust (| or use a store bought vegan pie crust)
Coconut Whip (| homemade or store bought)
chocolate shavings, optional for top

Instructions:
Prepare the pie crust: If using my recipe for Easy Vegan Pie Crust, prepare as instructed, transfer to a pie pan, poke holes in the bottom several times with a fork, and bake for 15-20 minutes at 350 degrees F. Remove and let cool while you make the filling.
Make the chocolate filling: Melt the chocolate chips in a microwave in 30 second intervals, stirring in between, until melted. It took me 1 1/2 minutes. Let it cool for a few minutes. Then add the melted chocolate chips to a blender along with the silken tofu, almond milk and sugar. Blend until very smooth.
Pour the filling on top of the crust. Place in the refrigerator to chill for at least 2 hours. The pie will firm up as it cools.
Once the pie has chilled, top with coconut whip cream and chocolate shavings, if desired. You can also serve each slice with a dollop of coconut whip. Serve and enjoy!
