Ingredients:
16 ounces uncooked elbow pasta (gluten free if needed)
1/2 cup vegan butter
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/3 cup all purpose flour (or gluten free flour)
2 cups unsweetened soy milk
1 package Violife Mature Cheddar Cheese, chopped into chunks* (see Notes for options)
1 package Violife Mozzarella Shreds*
2 tablespoons mellow white miso
1/2 teaspoon salt
pinch of ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon paprika
Optional:  cooked peas, broccoli, cauliflower, kale

Instructions:
Cook the pasta according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.
While the pasta cooks, make the sauce. Add the vegan butter to a large skillet over medium heat. Once the butter is mostly melted, add the garlic and sauté just a minute or two until fragrant, being careful not to burn it.
Sprinkle on the flour and whisk it into the garlic butter mixture, then whisk in soy milk, slowly.
Now add your dairy free cheddar cheese, whisk until some of it melts, then add dairy free mozzarella shreds and whisk until smooth and completely melted. Add in the miso, salt, pepper, and paprika, and whisk it all together until the mixture is creamy and smooth.
Add the cooked and drained pasta to the sauce and stir until pasta is coated in the cheesy mixture. Serve immediately and enjoy!
