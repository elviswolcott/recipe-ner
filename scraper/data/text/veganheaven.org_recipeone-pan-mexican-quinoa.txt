Ingredients:
1  small red onion, chopped
3  cloves of garlic, minced
2  bell peppers, chopped (I used an orange and a red one)
1 cup quinoa, uncooked and pre-rinsed
1 1/2 cup vegetable broth
3 cups canned diced tomatoes
1 15 oz can black beans, drained and rinsed
2 cups frozen corn
1 tablespoon paprika powder
1/2 tablespoon cumin
juice of one lime
2  green onions
1 cup fresh parsley, chopped
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste
red pepper flakes
1  avocado, to serve

Instructions:
Heat some oil in a large pot or pan and saut√© the onion for 2-3 minutes or until it becomes translucent. Then add the garlic and the bell pepper and cook for another 2 minutes on high heat.
Add the rest of the ingredients except for the lime juice, the green onions, and the parsley.
Cover with a lid and cook for 20 minutes. As the temperature varies a bit, make sure to check once in a while that your quinoa is not burning or sticking to the bottom of the pan by stirring with a wooden spoon. If so, lower the heat.&nbsp;
Then stir in the lime juice, the green onions, the parsley and season with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Serve with avocado on top.
