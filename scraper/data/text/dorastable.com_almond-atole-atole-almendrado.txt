Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups Almond milk, (unsweetened)
1 stick Ceylon cinnamon
2/3 cup Raw Almonds
1/4 cup Masa harina, (maseca)
1/2  cup Water
3  - 4 oz.  Piloncillo, ((half of a cone))
1 tsp. Ground cinnamon

Instructions:
Heat almond milk in a medium sauce pot, bring to a simmer.
While the milk comes to a simmer, grind the almonds in your blender until they resemble a powder. Set aside.
Dissolve the masa harina in 1/2 cup of water.
Add the masa harina to the almond milk, and mix well.
Simmer for 5 minutes, stirring to make sure it doesnâ€™t stick to the bottom of the pot.
Add the ground almonds, cinnamon stick, and piloncillo to the saucepot. Simmer at very low heat for 6 - 8 minutes.
Serve hot. Sprinkle with some ground cinnamon. As it cools it will thicken, so add more almond milk if necessary.
