Ingredients:
9 oz rotini pasta
1/2 cup cashews ((unsalted and not roasted))
2  large cloves of garlic
3 tablespoons nutritional yeast
2 teaspoons white miso paste
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 cup unsweetened almond milk
2 cups broccoli
9 oz button mushrooms
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste
red pepper flakes, optional
freshly chopped parsley

Instructions:
Cook the pasta according to the instructions. Set aside. 
In the meantime, make the creamy cashew sauce. Place all ingredients in a high speed blender and process until smooth. If you want to make it easier for your blender, you could soak the cashews overnight in cold water or 30 minutes in hot water. However, this step is not necessary if you use a Vitamix or a similar blender. 
Divide the broccoli into small florets. Slice the mushrooms. Cook the broccoli either in a bit of water or in an Instant Pot. Heat some oil in a large pan and sauté the mushrooms for about 3 minutes on high heat. 
Add the cashew sauce to the sautéed mushrooms. 
Cook for about 2 minutes. The sauce with thicken up considerably. 
Stir in the cooked pasta and the broccoli. Season with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Sprinkle with freshly chopped parsley. Enjoy!
