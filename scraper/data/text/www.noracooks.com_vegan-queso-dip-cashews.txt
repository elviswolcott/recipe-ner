Ingredients:
2 cups raw cashews, soaked in hot water for at least 5 minutes
1/2 cup water
4 tablespoons fresh lemon juice; from about 2 small lemons
2 teaspoons salt, or to taste
1/2 cup nutritional yeast
28 ounce canned Ro-tel tomatoes and green chiles
optional fresh chopped cilantro and a few diced tomatoes, for serving

Instructions:
Soak the cashews for at least 5 minutes in boiling hot water. I do this by heating water up in my tea kettle, then pouring it over the top of the cashews to cover. You can also boil in a small pot for 5 minutes.
Drain the soaked cashews and add them to a high powered blender along with the water, lemon juice, salt and nutritional yeast. Drain the juice from the tomatoes and green chiles and add the liquid to the blender as well (don&#039;t add the tomatoes and green chiles yet). Blend on high for a few minutes until very smooth.Â 
Add the cheese sauce and the Rotel tomatoes and green chiles to a medium pot. Stir well and warm gently over low-medium heat. Be careful not to burn the queso; stir frequently while warming. The mixture will thicken slightly, and you can add a little water if needed for a thinner texture.
Sprinkle with optional chopped cilantro and tomatoes and serve warm with tortilla chips. Enjoy!
