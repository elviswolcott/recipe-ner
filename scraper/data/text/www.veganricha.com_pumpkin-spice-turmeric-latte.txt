Ingredients:
1/4 cup water
1/4 to 1/2 tsp turmeric
1/2 tsp or more of my pumpkin pie spice (or 1/3 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ginger, a pinch of nutmeg, optional a pinch of all spice)
a pinch of black pepper
1.5 cups non dairy milk (I like almond milk)
1.5 tbsp or more sweetener of choice
turmeric (pumpkin pie spice or cinnamon for garnish)

Instructions:
Bring water and spices to a boil. Simmer for a minute.
Blend or froth the non dairy milk and sweetener until frothy. Add to the boiling water.
Bring to just about a boil.
Pour into mugs. Sprinkle pinches of turmeric and pumpkin pie spice and serve! You can also add a dollop of whipped non dairy cream on top to serve.
