Ingredients:
1  Pizza Crust (my 20 Minute Crust),  (or use my gluten-free crust (see Notes))
1  small sweet potato cubed
1/3 cup corn kernels, thawed if frozen
1/2  onion, sliced (sliced thick)
peppers or  other veggies
1  sliced jalapeno
1/3 cup soy-free bbq sauce (or other bbq sauce of choice)
1/2 tsp each of garlic powder (, oregano/parsley, ground mustard)
1/4 tsp each of onion powder (, thyme, cayenne, salt, celery seed)
1 tsp smoked paprika
1 tsp coconut sugar

Instructions:
Boil the Sweet potato and corn in a saucepan over medium heat. Add water just to cover the veggies. Boil for 5 minutes once boiling. Drain and cool for a minute then transfer to a bowl.
Toss with onions, peppers/veggies and 2 tbsp bbq sauce and a good dash of black pepper.
Shape the pizza dough into one large thin crust pizza.&nbsp;
Brush olive oil on the pizza dough. Spread Sweet potato mixture on the pizza. Add jalapeno. Sprinkle bbq seasoning all over the veggies generously. Drizzle some or all of the bbq sauce.&nbsp;
Bake at 425 degrees for 16 to 18 minutes. Cool for a minute. Garnish with cilantro, more bbq seasoning and more bbq sauce if you wish. Slice and serve.
