Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F / 220Âºc.
Remove the hard stems from the Asparagus spread. Chop the Asparagus spears into 2 inch pieces. Place on parchment lined sheet. Place garlic cloves and onion in the center of the sheet. Spray or brush oil. Sprinkle salt and pepper and bake for 12 to 15 minutes. Remove the garlic at 10 minutes if already golden.
Cool slightly, then blend with the cashews, broth, dill, basil, olive oil, salt and nutritional yeast.
Add blended puree to a pan and heat at medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Stir frequently. 8 - 10 minutes.
Taste and adjust salt. Add more water/broth if needed for desired consistency.
Garnish with cashew cream and black pepper. I blended the cashews with some basil, lemon juice, salt, pepper for a herbed cashew cream drizzle. or add some sour cream and onion clusters.
