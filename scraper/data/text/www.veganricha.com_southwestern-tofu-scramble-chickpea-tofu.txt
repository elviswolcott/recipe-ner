Ingredients:
1/2  Recipe chickpea flour tofu
1 tsp oil
3 cloves of garlic ( finely chopped)
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/2  chopped green bell pepper
1/4 cup corn
1/2 cup cubed sweet potato (raw or cooked (baked or boiled or steamed))
1 cup cooked black beans
1 tsp taco seasoning (, 1 tsp or more taco seasoning or chili powder blend or cajun spice blend)
1/4 tsp chipotle pepper powder
1/4 tsp or salt (add more as it depends on the beans and chickpea tofu)
chopped tomato (onion, cilantro and lemon juice for garnish)

Instructions:
Make the Chickpea flour tofu, cube and set aside. If using regular firm tofu, press between paper towels for 5 minutes, then cube and set aside.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add garlic, onion and a pinch of salt. Cook for 3 minutes. Add the peppers, corn and other veggies if using such as zucchini, mushrooms, broccoli (chopped small) and cook for 2 minutes.&nbsp;
Add the sweet potatoes. If using raw, add a 1/4 cup water, cover and cook for 6 to 8 minutes or until tender. If using cooked, mix in for a few seconds. I prefer to use cooked sweet potato.&nbsp;
Add beans, spices, salt and mix in. Add cubed or crumbled chickpea tofu and mix well. Cover and cook for 3 to 5 minutes. Taste and adjust salt and spice with additional paprika for smokier, oregano or parsley, salt etc. Add 1/8 tsp kala namak (Indian sulphur salt) for eggier flavor.&nbsp;
Add in some lemon and mix in. Garnish with chopped tomato, onion and cilantro and serve over toasts or a wrap. I usually like these with chimichurri toasts.&nbsp;
