Ingredients:
1  small zucchini (shredded)
1/2  heaping cup chopped carrots
3 cloves of garlic
1/2 inch ginger
1  green chili or use cayenne to taste
15 oz can chickpeas (drained or 1.5 cups cooked)
1/2 tsp cumin seeds
1/2 tsp coriander seeds
1/2 tsp black pepper corns or ground pepper
1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
1/4 tsp ground cardamom
1/2 to 3/4 tsp salt (depends on if the chickpeas were salted)
1 Tbsp flax seed meal or chia seed meal
1/4 cup oat flour or other flour ((chickpea flour, rice flour, wheat/while flours will work))
1 to 2 tbsp breadcrumbs or more flour
Oil as needed

Instructions:
Grate/shred the zucchini and add to a bowl using a grater or processor. Lightly press the zucchini in a paper towel if there is too much moisture.
Process carrots, ginger, garlic, chili in a food processor until shredded and add to bowl. Or use a grater.
Process chickpeas until coarsely blended, not fully a paste. Add to the bowl. (I use a mini food processor and it works really well for both the steps).
Make the Turkish spice blend : Crush the cumin coriander and black pepper using a mortar pestle. Or pulse in a spice grinder to a coarse meal. Heat 1/2 tsp oil in small skillet. When hot, add the crushed spices and cook until fragrant. You can also dry roast them until fragrant or add them unroasted.
Add the spices to the bowl. Add cinnamon, cardamom, salt, flour, flax and mix well. Add flour and mix in. Add breadcrumbs if needed.
Form patties and cook with a little oil in a skillet over medium heat for 5 to 6 minutes per side.
To bake, Bake at 400 degrees F for 20 to 25 minutes. Broil to crisp for a minute.
Serve as snack or breakfast with chutneys, sriracha, ketchup, vegan tzatziki, vegan cucumber raita or ranch.
