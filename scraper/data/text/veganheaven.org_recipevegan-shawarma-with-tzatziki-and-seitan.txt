Ingredients:
1 cup unsweetened soy yogurt
1/2  cucumber, grated
2  cloves of garlic, minced
salt
pepper
9  oz seitan, cut into pieces
1/2 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon paprika powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon soy sauce
salt
pepper
1/2  Turkish flat brat (You can also serve it in pitas or wraps. )
1  tomato, cut into slices
1/4  cucumber, cut into slices
lettuce, cut into stripes
red cabbage, cut into stripes
1/4  onion, cut into rings

Instructions:
First make the vegan tzatziki. Squeeze the grated cucumber and press out as much water as possible. Place the yogurt in a medium bowl and stir in the minced garlic and the cucumber. Season with salt and pepper and set aside.
In a medium pan, heat the olive oil and add the seitan. Season it with paprika and garlic powder, soy sauce, salt, and pepper and cook for about 5 minutes until it's brown and crispy.
Serve the seitan together with the tomato, cucumber, onion, lettuce, and the red cabbage in a Turkish flat bread (alternatively you can also use pitas or wraps) and top it off with some vegan tzatziki.
