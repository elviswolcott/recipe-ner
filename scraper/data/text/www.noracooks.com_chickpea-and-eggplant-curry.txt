Ingredients:
2 medium eggplants
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons olive oil, for sautéing
1 large onion, chopped
1  red bell pepper, seeded and diced
2 teaspoons ground coriander
2 teaspoons smoked paprika
2 teaspoons ground turmeric
1 teaspoon garam masala OR use curry powder (*I prefer garam masala but curry powder works)
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons fresh ginger, grated (*or use 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger)
(1) 14.5-oz can diced tomatoes
(1) 13.5-oz can full fat coconut milk
(1) 15-oz can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
1 teaspoon  salt, or more to taste
1/2 cup fresh chopped cilantro or parsley
4 cups cooked white or brown rice

Instructions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Lightly oil a large rimmed baking sheet.
Cut the tops off of the eggplant, then chop into 1 inch cubes. There is no need to peel the eggplant, unless you prefer to.
Add the eggplant chunks to the baking sheet, and drizzle with 3 tablespoons of olive oil. Stir to coat the eggplant in the oil, then spread out and sprinkle with a salt. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until the eggplant is tender.
Meanwhile, in a large skillet, add the 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Sauté the onion and red bell pepper for 4-5 minutes, until translucent and soft.
Now stir in the spices: coriander, smoked paprika, turmeric and garam masala (or curry powder). If the mixture gets too dry, add a few tablespoon of water to de-glaze the pan a bit. Cook for about 1 minute, then add the garlic and ginger and cook for 1 more minute.
To the skillet, add the canned diced tomatoes, coconut milk and chickpeas. Stir. Once the eggplant is done roasting, add to the skillet as well and stir in. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low and cook for 15-20 minutes. Add salt to taste.
Serve over cooked rice, fresh chopped cilantro/parsley and perhaps a side of vegan naan if desired.
