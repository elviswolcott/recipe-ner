1/2 cup cashew cream or non dairy cream ((optional))

Instructions:
Finely chop the mushroom, onion and garlic, by knife or in a food processor.&nbsp;Add to the instant pot.&nbsp; (Alternatively, You can cook the onion and garlic in 1/4 cup broth or wine on saute, for a few mins for additional flavor and then add mushrooms).
Add the spices, herbs, 1 tsp rosemary, salt, Worcestershire (or use 1 tablespoon soy sauce and 2 tablespoons red wine) and 1 cup broth.&nbsp;.(Additional flavors such as poultry seasoning, herbs&nbsp;can be added at this point. Use bouillon with water instead of broth.)
Mix well to combine. The mixture will look dry but mushrooms leak a ton of moisture under pressure. See stove top instructions in notes.&nbsp;
