Ingredients:
7 oz orzo
2 cups cherry tomatoes, cut into halves
1  English cucumber
7 oz marinated artichoke hearts in oil
1  red onion, cut into thin slices
20  black olives
1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
8 oz very firm tofu
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk
1 teaspoon dried thyme
3 cloves of garlic, minced
1 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves of garlic, minced
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
3 tablespoons white or red wine vinegar
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried thyme
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste

Instructions:
The night before making the salad, cut the tofu into small cubes. In a small bowl, combine all of the ingredients for the marinade. Fill the tofu and the marinade into a ziploc bag and store it overnight in the fridge.
Cook the orzo according to the instructions on the package. After cooking, drain it with a colander and run it under cold water. It will quickly cool it down and it will prevent it from clumping together. 
Roughly dice the cucumber. Cut the cherry tomatoes into halves and the red onion into thin slices. 
Make the dressing: in a small bowl whisk together the olive oil, the white wine vinegar, the dried oregano, basil, thyme, the lemon juice, the salt, and pepper. 
Place all of the ingredients for the salad in a large bowl. 
Add the freshly chopped parsley and toss with the dressing to serve immediately or store it in the fridge for later.
