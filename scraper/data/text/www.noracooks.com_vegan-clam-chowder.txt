Ingredients:
3/4 cup raw cashews
1 cup water
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium onion, diced
2 medium carrots, peeled and sliced
2  celery ribs, diced
4 tablespoons all purpose flour (gluten free if needed)
4 cups vegetable broth
15 ounce can hearts of palm, drained and chopped
1 teaspoon vegan Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon hot sauce
1 teaspoon Old Bay Seasoning
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 1/2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and chopped
Vegan Bacon, optional (see instruction #6 for options)

Instructions:
Bring 2 cups of water to a boil. Pour the hot water over the cashews and let soak for 5 minutes. Drain the cashews and discard the soaking water. Add them to a high powered blender along with 1 cup fresh water and blend until smooth and creamy. Set aside.
Warm the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté for 2-3 minutes.
Add the carrots and celery to the pot and sauté for another 2 minutes. Sprinkle the flour on top of the vegetables and stir, then slowly pour in the broth while stirring constantly.
Now add the chopped hearts of palm, Worcestershire sauce, thyme, hot sauce, old bay seasoning, salt, pepper and potatoes.
Bring the soup to a boil, then lower heat to a simmer and cook for about 20 minutes until the potatoes are fork tender.
If using vegan bacon, prepare it and cook it until crispy. I used Lightlife bacon, but my tempeh bacon would be great here (or tofu bacon).
Stir the cashew cream into the soup. It should now be very creamy. Serve with crackers, fresh chopped parsley and vegan bacon, if desired. Enjoy!
