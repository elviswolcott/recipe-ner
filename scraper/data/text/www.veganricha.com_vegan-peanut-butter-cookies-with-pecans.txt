Ingredients:
3/4 cup smooth peanut butter (heaped) (or almond butter)
1/2 cup coconut sugar  (or other sugar of choice)
2 to 3 tbsp powdered sugar (use 1 tbsp less if the nut butter is sweetened)
2 tsp vanilla extract
1 tbsp oil (or use more peanut/almond butter + 2 tsp non dairy milk)
1/4 cup non dairy milk (warm-hot ( I use almond milk))
1 cup + 2 Tbsp Spelt flour (Or use whole wheat pastry flour or ap flour)
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp baking powder
1/8 tsp salt
3 Tbsp chopped pecans (chopped small)
2 tbsp vegan mini chocolate chips ( or dried cranberries or omit)

Instructions:
In a bowl, add the nut butter, sugar, vanilla and oil and room temperature or warmed non dairy milk. Mix until well combined, creamy and smooth and no sugar can be seen. The heated dairy milk helps mix in the nut butter faster.
In another bowl, whisk all the dry ingredients. Add spices of choice for variation.
Add the 3/4 cup of the flour mix to the wet.and mix to make a soft dough. If the dough is too sticky, add a tbsp flour at a time and mix in. * If the dough is too crumbly, add a splash of non dairy milk or aquafaba and mix and continue to do it till it is one soft mass. Fold in the chopped pecans and chocolate chips
Chill the dough for 10 to 15 minutes. *You can chill the dough for upto 2 days to make ahead.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F/180Âºc.
Take 1.5 to 2 tbsp of the dough to make a ball. Place on parchment lined baking sheet.
Press each of the balls with a fork to flatten slightly and make a criss cross pattern.
Bake for 10 to 11 minutes (a minute longer for large cookies). The tops will be soft but will set as the cookies cool. If the tops and edges both are too soft, bake an extra minute.
Cool the cookies on the sheet for 15 minutes, then on wire rack until completely cooled. Serve!
