Ingredients:
1/2 cup uncooked millet (or use quinoa)
1 1/4 cup water
1.5 tsp or more italian herb blend
3/4 tsp salt
1 cup chopped raw beet - chopped 1/2- 3/4 inch ((1 medium beet))
1/2 cup chopped tomato (1 small tomato or use tomato puree/paste to taste)
2 tsp olive oil
1 Tbsp prepared mustard
1/4 cup or more finely chopped onion
2 tsp soy sauce  (or coconut aminos to make soy-free)
1 tsp Sriracha sauce or to taste
3/4 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp onion powder
15 oz can of kidney beans (or 1.5 cups cooked)
Oat flour (regular flour or breadcrumbs if needed)

Instructions:
Heat a saucepan over medium heat. Wash the millet, drain and add to the pan. Roast for 1 minute. Add water, italian herbs, salt and beet and tomato to the pan. Cover and Bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to low-medium and cook for 20-22 minutes. Check if the millet is tender, else cook for another few minutes. Let sit covered for 5 minutes. Drain the mixture if there is excess liquid.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F / 200c if baking.
Add in the chopped onion, mustard sauce, soy sauce, olive oil. garlic powder, onion powder to the millet mixture and mix well. Add kidney beans and mix. Mash the mixture well and mix by hand or potato masher, so most of the beans and beet pieces break down. Taste and adjust salt, spice, mustard.
If the mixture is too soft or wet, add a Tablespoon or so of oat flour or bread crumbs. Shape into patties using a 3 inch cookie cutter. Brush the patties with a little oil. Bake at pre-heated 400 degrees F for 20 minutes, flip and bake for another 5 to 10 minutes. Add vegan cheese slices in the last 5 minutes.
Or pan fry on stove top for 3-5 minutes each side over medium heat. I like these baked.
Top with vegan cheese of choice, prepared mustard or vegan ranch, pickles, crunchy lettuce, tomato. Pictured above with daiya cheddar slice melted.
