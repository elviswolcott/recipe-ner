Ingredients:
1/2 cup Quinoa
2 teaspoons Oil
1/4 cup chopped Leek
1/3 cup chopped Carrots
1/3 cup chopped Red bell pepper
Add other veggies like celery, mushrooms, greens of choice ( quantities depending on the amount of cooked quinoa)
1/4 tsp chili flakes  (or chopped green chili)
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 cup Peas
2/3 teaspoon salt
1/2 tsp lemon juice
roasted nuts, cashew or almond slivers, chopped cilantro (garnish)

Instructions:
Cook&nbsp; Quinoa according to instructions(I usually cook 1/2 cup quinoa it in a little more than 3/4 cups water, roughly 1.5 times water, for about 15 minutes). You can also toast the quinoa a little before adding water for a fluffier nuttier quinoa. Fluff it up as soon as cooked.
In a pan on medium heat, Oil, Leek, Carrots and Red bell pepper. Add other veggies like celery, mushrooms, greens of choice in quantities depending on the amount of cooked quinoa.
Cook for 3-4 minutes, uncovered, until Leek and Carrots start to get brown on the edges.
Add chili flakes, dried basil and Peas and cook for another 2 minutes.
Add in the cooked quinoa, salt and lemon juice and mix well.
Cook covered on low heat for 2-3 minutes.
Garnish with roasted nuts(cashew or almond slivers, optional), chopped cilantro and serve hot!
