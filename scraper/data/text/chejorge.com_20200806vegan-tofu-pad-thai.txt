Ingredients:
2 tablespoons peanut oil (substitute: vegetable oil)
150 grams rice noodles
130 grams bean sprouts
2  scallions, segmented
2 tablespoons brown sugar (or cane sugar)
1  shallot, finely minced
3 cloves garlic, finely minced
2 dried red chili peppers, deseeded & thinly sliced
100 grams fried tofu, cubed
2 tablespoons chopped roasted peanuts, for topping
1 tablespoon light soy sauce
1 tablespoon dark soy sauce
2 tablespoons tamarind paste
1 tablespoon light brown miso
2 tablespoons sriracha
1 teaspoon doubanjiang, or spicy broad bean paste
2 tablespoons room temperature water

Instructions:
Prepare the Noodles. Soak the rice noodles in hot water for 4-5 minutes, or until the noodles are softened (but not completely cooked). Drain and set aside.
Make the Sauce. First, mix the miso with the water to loosen the paste. Then add all the rest of sauce ingredients. Mix and set aside.
Make the Pad Thai. Heat up peanut oil (or vegetable oil) in a non-stick pan or wok on medium-high heat. Note: This may seem like a lot of oil but it is crucial if you don't want the noodles to stick! First, fry the garlic, shallots, and dried chili peppers until aromatic, about 2 minutes. Then, add the brown sugar (or cane sugar) along with fried tofu cubes, and cook until the sugar caramelizes, around 1-2 minutes. Add in the prepared sauce, followed by rice noodles. Stir very well to combine, and make sure the rice noodles don't stick together.
Finish the Pad Thai. Taste the noodles to see whether or not they are cooked — they should be soft but retain a bit of a chew. If they are not cooked yet, simply add some water (2 tablespoons at a time) and continue to cook until the water evaporates. When the noodles are cooked to your desired done-ness, take the pan off the heat and add bean sprouts and scallion segments. Toss and use residual heat to heat the vegetables through. Top Pad Thai with crushed peanuts to finish. Serve warm.
