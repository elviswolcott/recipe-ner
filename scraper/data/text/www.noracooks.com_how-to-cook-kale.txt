Ingredients:
10 ounce bag chopped kale (or 1 large bunch kale, washed and chopped)
1 cup water

Instructions:
Pour the water into the inner cooking pot of the Instant Pot.&nbsp;
Add the chopped kale. Don't worry if there are some stems, the Instant Pot will make them edible and not too chewy.&nbsp;
Place the lid on, set the valve to seal and cook on high, manual pressure for 3 minutes.
Once it beeps, you can either do a quick pressure release or let it naturally release (usually this takes about 10 minutes).
Serve in hearty rice and bean bowls, or on the side of any meal. Sprinkle with salt or balsamic vinegar. It's also particularly good with cashew cream.
