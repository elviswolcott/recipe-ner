Ingredients:
1/2  large onion (chopped)
5 cloves garlic
1 inch ginger
1  green chile (remove seeds to reduce heat if needed)
1 tsp oil
2  large tomatoes
1/4 cup raw cashews (soaked for 15 mins if needed, use 1/3 cup for creamier sauce)
1/2 to 1 tsp garam masala
1/2 tsp paprika
1 tsp dried fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi)
6 to 8 oz sliced white mushrooms
3/4 cup or more peas
1/2 tsp or more salt
1/4 tsp or more sugar
1 cup chopped spinach (optional)
cayenne to preference
cilantro for garnish

Instructions:
Blend onion, garlic, ginger, chile with a few tbsp of water to a puree in a blender.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the above puree. Cook for 5 to 7 mins or until the onion smell is not raw. Stir occasionally.
Meanwhile, blend tomatoes and cashews in the same blender until smooth. Blend for two 1 min cycles so the cashews are blended in. Add the pureed tomato puree, garam masala, paprika, and fenugreek to the skillet. Cook for 7 to 8 minutes.Stir occasionally.
Add mushrooms, peas, other veggies, 1/2 cup or more water, salt, sugar. I added a 1/2 cup cooked chickpeas as well as seen in the pictures. Mix well.
Cover and cook for 10 mins or till the mushrooms are cooked to preference.
Fold in spinach if using, taste adjust salt and heat. I usually add some cayenne.
Garnish with cilantro and serve over rice, cooked grains or with flatbread.
