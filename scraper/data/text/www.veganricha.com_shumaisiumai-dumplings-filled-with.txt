Ingredients:
1 cup all purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt or to taste
warm water
cornstarch as needed
1 teaspoon oil
1/2  loaded cup small chopped broccoli
1/2 cup chopped zucchini
1 teaspoon canola oil
1 teaspoon sesame oil
2 teaspoon hoisin sauce
1/2 teaspoon raw sugar or agave syrup
1/2 teaspoon chili flakes
1  + Tablespoon finely chopped garlic to taste

Instructions:
Mix in the flour, half a teaspoon of cornstarch and salt
Grease your hand with oil. Add in the warm water a little at a time till the dough starts to come together. Knead for a few minutes till it doesnt stick and is elastic.
Let the dough rest covered by a towel for half an hour to an hour.
Make small balls and roll them out, or roll out bigger ball and cut square or circle shapes depending on what you want to use the wrappers for.
The rolling out takes some effort. Use cornstarch to dust if dough is sticky. The dough is also elastic, so roll it out, let it rest for a few seconds, then lift and roll out more.
For the Shumai, I rolled the small balls into circles.
To store, dust with cornstarch and store in airtight bag in the refrigerator.
In a pan, heat some canola oil and add garlic and chili flakes and cook on medium heat for a few seconds.
Add in the broccoli and zucchini, toss and let cook for 3-4 minutes.
Add in the hoisin sauce, salt if needed, sugar and sesame oil.&nbsp;Mix and cook covered for another 3-4 minutes.
Adjust spice and sauce for taste and let cool.
