Ingredients:
1 Recipe Beer Battered Vegan Fried Fish
12 small corn or flour tortillas
1/2 small purple cabbage, shredded
2  roma tomatoes, finely diced
1/4  white or red onion, finely diced
1/2 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped
1-2  avocados, sliced or diced
crumbled vegan cheese (I used Violife Feta, reminds me of Cotija cheese!)
1-2  limes, cut into wedges, for serving
1/2 cup vegan mayo
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon Sriracha hot sauce

Instructions:
First, go make the fried vegan fish.
Prepare all the taco toppings, and set aside.
In a small bowl, combine the sauce ingredients and whisk until smooth. Set aside.
Once the fish are fried, warm the tortillas. You can quickly toast them on a dry skillet over medium/high heat, or wrap several in paper towels with a little water drizzled on them and microwave for 1 minute.
Assemble: Place a few pieces of fish in each tortilla, followed by toppings of choice and finished with a generous drizzle of sauce. If the &quot;fish&quot; are rather large, slice them into a few smaller pieces.
Serve with lime wedges for squeezing over the tacos and enjoy immediately.
