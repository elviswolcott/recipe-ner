Ingredients:
2/3 cup old fashioned oats ground.
1/3 cup oats
1/2 tsp guar gum ((optional. Iâ€™ve made these without the gum and they comes out fine))
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 cup puffed rice ((murmura in hindi. cheap at an indian store))
1/2 cup vegan chocolate chips
2 tablespoons virgin coconut oil
1 tablespoon organic canola oil
2 tablespoons agave
3 Tablespoons raw sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon flaxmeal
4 tablespoons water
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice or other spices of choice

Instructions:
In a bowl, mix the flaxmeal in 2 Tablespoons hot water and keep for 2 minutes.
Add in 2 tablespoons hot water, coconut oil and canola oil and mix so the coconut oil melts a bit. (or melt the coconut oil separately and add)
Add in the sugar, agave, spices, salt and lemon juice and mix well for 2 minutes using hand or electric mixer( I dont use the electric one, since the mixture doesnt need much fluffing up)
Grind the 2/3 cup oats along with baking powder and guar gum, or use 1/2 cup oat flour and mix in the baking powder and guar gum powder. Add to wet mix.
Coarsely grind the puffed rice/rice krispies, with just a few pulses to break the rice into smaller pieces. Add this to wet mix as well.
Add the whole oats and chocolate chips and mix well to combine.
Drop spoonfulls on parchment lined baking sheet. press down with oiled hand or spoon and shape a bit.
Bake in preheated 350 degrees F oven for 12-14 minutes. Cool on rack and enjoy!
