Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups rolled oats
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup brown sugar or coconut sugar
1/2 cup vegan butter
1 teaspoon natural vanilla extract
1/4 cup unsweetened almond milk
1 pinch of salt

Instructions:
Preheat your oven to 350 F. Place the vegan butter and the brown sugar into a mixing bowl. 
Using a handheld mixer beat the butter and the sugar until light and fluffy.
Add the vanilla extract and beat again until combined. 
Then add the flour, the baking powder, the almond milk, and a pinch of salt. Beat until a dough has formed. This should take about 1 minute. 
Add the rolled oats and beat again until combined. 
Line a baking tray with parchment paper and scoop two tablespoons of the cookie dough for each cookie on the baking tray. Form 12 large cookies. You could do this by first making a small ball and then press it flat with your hand and fingers. 
Bake for 15 minutes at 350 F. The top should be lightly browned. Transfer to a cooling rack and let them cool completely.
