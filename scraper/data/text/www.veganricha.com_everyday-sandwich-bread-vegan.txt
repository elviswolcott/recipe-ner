Ingredients:
1 cup warm water
1.5 cups whole wheat flour (I use Bob's Red Mill)
1.25 cups bread flour
1 Tablespoons agave syrup
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon raw sugar
2 teaspoons active yeast (Red Star)
1 Tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (or virgin coconut oil)

Instructions:
In a large bowl, add 2 Tablespoons warm water, 1 teaspoon sugar and yeast. Mix and let sit until frothy(10 minutes).
Add salt to the 1.5 cups wheat flour and mix. Add wheat flour and 1 cup bread flour to the yeast mix,
Add agave, oil, rest of the water and knead 6-8 minutes in stand mixer or 8-10 minutes by hand.
If the dough is sticky, then add a little bread flour until the the dough is soft and almost not sticky.
Place dough in well greased container. Cover with towel and let sit for 1.5 hours or until doubled.
Punch dough down, use a Tablespoon or so bread flour to help make the dough less sticky.
Pull a bit on all sides and tuck under to get a taut top. Place the tucked side down on parchment lined or well greased bread pan.
Spray water liberally on top, then sprinkle some flour or oats on top.
Cover with towel and let rise for 45 minutes or until doubled.
Bake at 365 degrees F for 35-40 minutes, or until a tap on he top sounds hollow.
Cool completely before slicing.
