Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/3 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups non-dairy milk
1 teaspoon vinegar
1/2 cup water
3 tablespoons of oil
1/2 teaspoon vanilla  extract
1/2 cup pumpkin puree
2 tablespoons maple syrup
3 tablespoons brown sugar or coconut sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon
3/4 teaspoon ginger
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg
good pinch of clove powder and allspice

Instructions:
In a bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and set aside.
In another bowl, mix the milk, vinegar, water, oil, and vanilla and set aside to curdle.
In a small skillet, add the pumpkin puree with the maple, sugar, and spices and mix well. Cook until the mixture starts to bubble nicely and thickens and starts to get fragrant.
Once it&#39;s bubbling, cook for another minute and then switch off heat.Â Let this mixture cool a little bit.
Mix the milk mixture into the flour mixture until well combined to make pancake batter
Then lightly fold in the pumpkin puree mixture until it&#39;s half combined and half kind of swirly (see pictures).
Heat your pancake skillet. When it&#39;s hot,  add a drizzle of oil and spread all over with a paper towel.
Then pour a 1/4 to 1/3 cup of the pancake mix on the skillet and cook 3-4 minutes per side. Repeat for all the batter and serve freshly cooked
You can also bake this mixture into sheet pancakes. To make this sheet pancakes, add 2 tablespoons of almond flour and 2 tablespoons of more flour into the mixture and mix and then pour into a greased 9 by 13 inch or larger baking sheet and then bake at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 15-20 minutes.
Serve the pancakes with maple syrup, vegan butter, or candied pecans.
