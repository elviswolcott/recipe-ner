Ingredients:
4 oz Tempeh
1 cup water or vegetable stock
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ginger+garlic paste
3/4 teaspoon spice mix of choice
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice.

Instructions:
Cut Tempeh into 1/4-1/2 inch strips.
In a medium pan, (strips should fit in the pan without overlapping), add about a cup of water or vegetable stock, 1/4 teaspoon salt or to taste, 1/2 teaspoon ginger+garlic paste and 3/4 teaspoon spice mix of choice and 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice.
Mix well and drop tempeh slices in this broth. The slices should be well submerged and not over each other.
Cover and cook on low-medium heat for 10 minutes. Turn the Tempeh around and cook for another 5-7 minutes or until all the broth is completely absorbed. At this point you can let the tempeh cook on the dry pan a little longer to get browned, or transfer to your sandwich.
