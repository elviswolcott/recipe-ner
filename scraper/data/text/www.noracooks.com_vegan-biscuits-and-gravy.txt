Ingredients:

1/8 teaspoon dried crushed rosemary
1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes

Instructions:
In a large pan over medium-high heat, cook the vegan sausage.
Now add the flour, cashew milk and vegan butter. Cook on medium heat for 5-10 minutes, stirring constantly, until the gravy thickens.
Add the thyme, rosemary, red pepper flakes, salt and pepper. Taste the gravy and add any additional seasonings, salt or pepper, as desired.
Serve immediately over warm biscuits and enjoy!
