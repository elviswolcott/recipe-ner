Ingredients:
2 cups cubed sweet potatoes
7 oz firm tofu (pressed and cubed into 3/4 inch cubes)
1 15 oz can  chickpeas or lentils (drained. Or any other beans)
1  red bell pepper (chopped into 3/4 inch thick)
1/2  red onion (coarsely chopped)
1/2 to 1 cup veggies of choice (such as broccoli, butternut squash, any seasonal veggies, etc)
3-4 tbsp sunflower seeds
1 tbsp oil
2 tsp soy sauce ((use tamari for glutenfree))
2 tsp vegan Worcestershire sauce
1 tsp paprika
1 tsp thyme
1 tsp oregano
3 tbsp bbq sauce
1 tsp prepared mustard
2 tbsp ketchup
3/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp black pepper
1/4 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/3 cup cashew cream (which is 1/4 cup of cashews blended with 1/4 cup water, or use vegan Mayo )
1 tsp vinegar
1/4 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp ground mustard
1/4 tsp salt

Instructions:
Chop all of your veggies if you haven&#039;t already. Line or grease a large baking dish.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (205 c)
In a bowl, mix in all of the cheeseburger sauce ingredients until well combined. Reserve 1 1/2 - 2 tbsp of this mixture to use later to drizzle on top.
Add the chopped veggies, and toss well to coat with the cheeseburger sauce mixture, until evenly coated.
Drop this mixture into the prepared baking dish, and spread it out. You don&#039;t want the mixture to be thicker than double. I like to keep a single layer of the veggies and beans etc, it will give you the best result in terms of crispiness of the big veggies.
Bake at 400 degrees F for 35-45 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes are tender to preference, and everything else is starting to get gold and crisp. Sprinkle sunflower seeds on top in the last 5-10 mins of baking
To make your Garlic Mayo Dressing: blend all the ingredients until well combined, taste and adjust flavor by adding more vinegar, salt, etc. You can also use already prepared non-dairy cream, or 1/4 cup vegan mayo instead.
To serve, serve individual portions of the veggie tofu bean mixture, and drizzle the mayo on top. Thin out the reserved cheeseburger sauce with a tsp or two of water, and drizzle that as well.
Top with some red pepper flakes, and fresh herbs of choice, and serve. You can also serve the tofu veggie mix over a bed of fresh lettuce!
