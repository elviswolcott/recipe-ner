Ingredients:
8 ounces macaroni noodles
2 ribs celery, minced
1/2 medium red bell pepper, minced
1/4 small red onion, minced ((1/4 cup))
1/4 cup chopped sweet pickles ((or sweet pickle relish))
1/4 cup minced fresh dill
1 cup raw cashews (OR vegan mayo, see NOTES)
3/4 cup water, for blending
2 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
3 tablespoons sweet pickle juice
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
2 teaspoons mustard ((yellow or dijon))
1/2 teaspoon salt

Instructions:
Soak the cashews:Â Heat up about 2 cups of water in a tea kettle or small pot. Pour the boiling hot water over the cashews and let them soak while you prepare the noodles.
Prepare the macaroni noodles according to package instructions, then immediately rinse well with cold water. Add the drained noodles to a large bowl.
Finely chop the celery, red bell pepper, red onion, dill, sweet pickles and add them all to the bowl with the noodles.
Make the dressing: Drain the soaked cashews, and then add them to a high powered blender along with the 3/4 cup fresh water, apple cider vinegar, sweet pickle juice, sugar, mustard and salt. Blend on high until very smooth.
Pour the dressing over your macaroni salad ingredients and toss until everything is well coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes if you can to allow the flavors to meld together. The sauce thickens up in the refrigerator, so simply add a little water and mix until it thins out a bit.
