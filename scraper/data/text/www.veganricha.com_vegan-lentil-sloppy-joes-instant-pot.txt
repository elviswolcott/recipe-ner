Ingredients:
1/4 cup broth (, or use 1 tsp oil to saute)
1/2  onion (chopped)
3 cloves of garlic (chopped)
1/2  bell pepper (chopped)
1/2 cup chopped celery
1/2 cup chopped carrots
1/2 tsp smoked paprika
1/4 tsp black pepper
1 tbsp chili powder blend (or taco seasoning or bbq seasoning)
1 cup finely chopped tomato or tomato sauce
1/4 cup tomato paste
1-2 tsp  vegan Worcestershire sauce (optional, (or use soy sauce/tamari, or coconut aminos for soyfree), )
2 tsp lemon juice
3/4 cup dried green lentils (, picked for stones and washed if needed)
1 1/4 cup water or broth
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp sugar

Instructions:
Add 2 tbsp broth in the Instant Pot on saute. Add the onion, garlic, pepper, celery, carrots and a good pinch of salt. Cook for 3 mins. Deglaze with more broth mid-way.&nbsp; (See saucepan instructions in Notes below).
Add the spices, tomato, tomato paste, vegan Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice and mix in. Add salt, sugar, lentils, broth, and mix in. Mix well to pick up any stuck bits&nbsp;
Close the lid and pressure cook at bean/chili setting for 22 mins or at manual/pressure cook for 16 minutes. Let the pressure release naturally. Taste and adjust salt, flavor. (The sauce keeps thickening on cooling even if it looks slightly liquidy when opened. If you used extra broth, wait for a few mins to see if its thickening enough and then you might have to saute for a few mins to reduce. )
Serve in buns or bread with coleslaw or onion or crunchy greens.&nbsp; or in wraps or over baked potato.&nbsp;These sloppy lentils are freezer friendly and meal prep friendly. Refrigerate for upto 4 days and freeze for upto a month.&nbsp;
