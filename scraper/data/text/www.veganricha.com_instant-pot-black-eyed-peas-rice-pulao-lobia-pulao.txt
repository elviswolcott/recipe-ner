Ingredients:
1/2 cup uncooked/dry black eyed peas
2/3 cup brown basmati rice
1 tsp oil
1/3 tsp cumin seeds
1/3 tsp mustard seeds
3  cloves
1/4 cup raw or roasted peanuts (, or use cashews (or sunflower seeds or dalia(roasted chickpeas) for nutfree))
1/2  onion (chopped)
5 cloves of garlic (chopped)
1/2 inch ginger (chopped)
1/2  hot green chile (optional)
1/2 tsp turmeric
1 tsp coriander powder
1/2 to 1 tsp garam masala (or 1 to 1.5 tsp biryani masala)
1/3 tsp cayenne (less or more to preference)
1  large tomato chopped
1/2  bell pepper (chopped, or other veggies)
1 3/4 cup water
3/4 to 1 tsp salt
lemon juice (, cilantro for garnish)

Instructions:
Soak the black eyed peas and basmati rice in hot water for 20-30 minutes. In the meanwhile, prep and follow the next steps.
Press saute mode on IP. Add oil and let it get hot. Add the seeds and cloves and cook for half a minute. Add the nuts and cook for a minute to roast. Add the onion, ginger, garlic, and chile and a pinch of salt and cook for 2 minutes. Stir occasionally.
Add the ground spices (turmeric through cayenne) and mix in.&nbsp; Add the tomato and peppers and mix in. Cook for a minute.
Drain the black eyed peas and rice and add to the pot. Add water and salt and mix in.
Pressure cook for 18 to 20 minutes. Let the pressure release naturally.
Taste and adjust salt. Add more garam masala or other spices if needed and mix in.
Add a good dash of lemon and cilantro, some chopped red onion and serve with pappadum or crackers. I also like the pulao with some kachumbar salad.&nbsp;
