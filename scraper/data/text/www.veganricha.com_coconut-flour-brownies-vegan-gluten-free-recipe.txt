1 cup light coconut milk or almond milk or other non dairy milk
3 Tbsp flaxmeal

1/2 cup vegan semi sweet chocolate chips

2 Tbsp ground sugar or 12 drops stevia
3 Tbsp oil (coconut or organic canola)
2.5 tsp vanilla extract
3/4 cup + 2 Tbsp Tbsp coconut flour
3 Tbsp cornstarch (or arrowroot or tapioca starch)
1/4 tsp baking soda

1/8 tsp pinch of salt

Heat coconut milk to just about a boil. Pour into to a bowl. Add the flax meal, psyllum husk, Dark chocolate, semi sweet chocolate and let sit for minute. Then mix well to melt to a smooth consistency.
Add the maple, sugar, oil, vanilla extract, and mix well. Let sit for 5 minutes.
In another bowl, add coconut flour, starch, baking powder and soda and salt. Whisk well.
Add dry to the wet and mix to combine. Fold in the chocolate chips. Taste and add more sugar if needed. The batter will be more of a spongy soft dough and it will continue to dry out. Do not let it sit for long. bake immediately. Transfer batter/dough to greased or parchment lined pan. Pat down to flatten.
