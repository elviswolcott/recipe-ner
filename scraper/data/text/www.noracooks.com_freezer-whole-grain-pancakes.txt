Ingredients:
4 cups Spelt Flour
1 1/2 cups Rolled Oats
1/4 cup ground flaxseed
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
2 1/2 tablespoon baking powder
2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 cup organic sugar
1/2 cup applesauce
1 tablespoon vanilla
4 cups almond milk (unsweetened)

Instructions:
First, combine your dry ingredients in a large bowl.
Next, whisk together all wet ingredients in a medium bowl.
Pour wet mixture into dry, and mix until combined. Try not to over mix. You may need more liquid depending on the flour you use. If the mixture is too thick, add a little water.
Heat a pancake griddle or other large pan over medium heat. You might need to spray your pan with a little oil so they donâ€™t stick. When hot, drop small ladle fulls (about 1/3 cup) on to the pan. When bubbles appear, flip the pancake over and cook for a few more minutes.
Serve hot with maple syrup, nut butter, blueberries or banana.
Freeze leftovers: Place cooled pancakes in freezer ziploc bags, seal tightly and place in the freezer. Should keep for at least a month. When ready to serve, pull frozen pancake out of bag, and either microwave for 1-2 minutes or warm in a toaster until heated through.
