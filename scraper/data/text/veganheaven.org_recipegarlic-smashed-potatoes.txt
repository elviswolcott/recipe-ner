Ingredients:
12  small to medium-sized potatoes
4 tablespoons olive oil
3  cloves of garlic, minced
2 tablespoons freshly chopped parsley
black pepper, to taste
sea salt, to taste

Instructions:
Boil the potatoes for 30 minutes. Let them cool in a colander for about 5 minutes.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and place the cooked potatoes on top. Use a potato masher to squish them. Make sure to keep them in one piece.
Combine the olive oil, the minced garlic, the chopped parsley, salt, and black pepper in a small bowl.
Pour the mixture over each potato. Add some more sea salt on top. Preheat your oven to 350 F.
Bake the potatoes for 25 minutes until they're golden and crispy. If you want them to be even crispier, you can also bake them for up to 30 to 35 minutes. But make sure they don't get too brown.
Serve immediately. Season with a little bit of additional salt and freshly chopped parsley. Enjoy!
