Ingredients:
1/2 cup smooth peanut butter (( use almond butter or cashew butter for peanut free) see notes for nutfree)
1/3 cup maple syrup
2 tbsp warmed non dairy milk (such as almond, soy, oat or coconut)
1/2 tsp vanilla extract (optional)
3/4 to 1 cup flour (I use a mix of 3/4 all purpose and 1/4 wheat. Use oat flour or gf blend for glutenfree)
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/3 tsp salt
3-4 tbsp fruit preserves (Raspberry, strawberry, cherry etc  as needed)

Instructions:
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
In a bowl mix the peanut butter, warmed (to almost hot) milk, maple syrup and vanilla extract until well combined and smooth. It will take about a minute to fully come together.
Mix flour, baking soda, and salt in another bowl, then add 3/4 cup of the dry mix to the wet and make a soft sticky dough. Depending on your peanut butter and flour you might need to add a bit more flour. The dough will be soft but shouldn’t be too runny/sticky. It will get more handleable on chilling. Refrigerate the cookie dough for 15 mins. If still too sticky then add more flour.
Shape the dough into about an inch wide balls. Place the dough balls on a parchment-lined baking sheetz Make dents using a Measuring spoon or end of a spatula. Warm the preserves and mix with a spoon so they are not lumpy. fill the dents with warmed preserves or jam. (Warming the preserves makes it easy to fill the cookies cleanly).
Bake the cookies for 11 mins.
Cool completely before storing. Store on the counter for up to five days Or refrigerate for up to two weeks.
