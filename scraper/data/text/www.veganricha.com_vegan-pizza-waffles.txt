Ingredients:
1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
1 Tbsp semolina flour or rice flour (or use more all purpose )
1 tsp active yeast
⅓ tsp salt
1/4 tsp baking powder
optional add ins: 1/2 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp pepper flakes
2 tsp extra virgin olive oil
1 ½ cups warm water
½ cup thinly sliced red or green bell pepper (or a mix of both)
½ cup or more  thinly sliced mushrooms
½ cup other thinly sliced vegetables of your choice (optional)
¾ cup pizza sauce
½ cup vegan shredded mozzarella
1 tsp red pepper flakes
3 cloves garlic (minced)
Oil (as needed)

Instructions:
Make the pizza batter first - add all of the dry ingredients to a bowl and mix well. Add in the extra virgin olive oil and warm water, mix until the mixture is like a pancake batter. Let this mixture sit for 20-25 minutes until it gets bubbly. (You can add in some dried oregano, garlic powder for flavor or swirl in a bit of pizza sauce jn the batter itself for variation)
Meanwhile you can chop up the vegetables and gather other additions
To make the waffles, heat your waffle iron and add a few drops of oil. Add a spoonful of the pizza batter and spread it around - you want a thin layer. Add a small spoonful of the pizza sauce at every corner, not too much
Top this with your sliced mushrooms, peppers, and shredded mozzarella. Add another layer of the pizza batter on top, no need to cover the entire surface. Top with optional minced garlic and drizzle of oil and close waffle iron
Let the waffle cook until it’s golden brown on both sides, flip waffle if it’s not browning evenly, cook for a few more minutes
Repeat for all of the waffles, transfer prepared waffles onto a rack so they don’t get soggy. Serve immediately, these are best when served warm and crispyTo reheat, you can reheat for 5-10 mins in the oven at 400 deg F which will also help keep them crispy
