Ingredients:
1/4 cup oil
1/4 cup maple syrup
1/2 cup non-dairy milk
3/4 cup pumpkin puree
1/4 cup sugar
2 cups  flour (, I use 1.5 cups  all purpose mixed with 1/2 cup whole wheat/spelt )
2 teaspoons baking powder.
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/3 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1.5 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
10 to 12  dates (chopped)
3/4 cup shredded carrots (, pressed between paper towels if too moist )
3 tbsp shredded coconut  (optional)

Instructions:
In a large bowl mix all the wet ingredients until well combined.
Add one and a half cups of flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and spices and mix well.
Add the dates and carrots and mix in. At this point, you can add 3 tablespoons of coconut flakes (optional) and mix in.
The batter should be pretty thick. If its not stiff, add more flour a  tbsp at a time(moisture content in Canned pumpkin purees varies, you want a stiff thick batter)
Transfer the mixture into a parchment lined baking pan. Bake at 365 degrees F for 55 to 60 minutes.
Cool for 10 minutes then remove from the pan and cool completely.
Make your frosting and Frost after cooled completely.  Top with  vegan cream cheese frosting or cashew cream frosting or plain whipped coconut cream. Store: The bread can be stored on the counter for the day and refrigerated for upto a week.
