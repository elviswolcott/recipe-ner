Ingredients:
1 Tbsp vegan butter
4 to 6 oz of frozen spinach or chopped spinach
1 clove garlic (minced)
 teaspoon red pepper flakes
 to  tsp salt
 cup raw cashews ( soaked in hot water for at least 15 minutes)
1 cup water
2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
1  small garlic clove  (or use  teaspoon of garlic powder.)
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
1 pinch onion powder
1/2 teaspoon miso paste
2 teaspoons  flour (, I use all-purpose, see notes for Glutenfree )
1 Tbsp vegan butter
8 oz mushrooms (sliced)
 teaspoons salt
 teaspoon black pepper
sliced bread as needed
sliced tomatoes

Instructions:
Cook your spinach by adding vegan butter to a skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook until it starts to turn golden on some of the edges. Add in the spinach, pepper flakes, and salt, and cook until the spinach has wilted. If using frozen spinach then cook until the water is evaporated.
