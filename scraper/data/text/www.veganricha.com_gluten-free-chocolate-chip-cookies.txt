Ingredients:
1/4 cup oil
1/3  cup ground raw sugar  (or coconut sugar)
2 tbsp almond milk  (or other non dairy milk)
2 tbsp almond butter (heaped)
1 tbsp flaxseed meal  (or chia seed meal)
1/4 tsp salt
1.5 tsp vanilla extract
1 1/4 cup oat flour (use certified gluten-free if needed)
3/4 cup almond flour
1/4 cup buckwheat  (or sorghum or other gluten-freeflour)
2 Tbsp starch  (such as cornstarch or arrowroot starch)
3/4 tsp baking soda
3/4 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/4 cup vegan chocolate chips
1/4 cup vegan chocolate chunks
2 tbsp vegan mini chocolate chips

Instructions:
In a bowl, combine all the wet ingredients, Mix well until well combined
In a another bowl, combine all the dry ingredients except chocolate and whisk well.
Add dry to the wet. Mix to make a soft somewhat sticky dough. (If the dough is too stiff, add in a bit more oil or non dairy milk). Fold in the chocolate chips and mix to distribute. Chill the dough for 10 to 15 minutes,
Preheat the oven to 360 degrees F / 180c. Divide the dough in smooth balls. Place on parchment lined baking sheet. Lightly flatten the balls. Put a drop of water at the center of each cookie. Bake for 13 to 14 minutes. Bake until just about starting to get golden on the edges. Longer baking will make them crunchier.
The cookies wil be soft when they come out of the oven but will harden in a few minutes while they cool. Cool completely before storing.
