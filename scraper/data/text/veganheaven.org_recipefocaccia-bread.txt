Ingredients:
4 cups all-purpose flour
0.6 oz fresh active yeast (one package) (You could replace it with 1 teaspoon of dried yeast. )
1 pinch brown sugar
1 cup lukewarm water
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon olive oil
1  clove of garlic, minced
12  cherry tomatoes, cut into halves
10  olives, green and black
fresh rosemary
sea salt, to taste

Instructions:
Place all the ingredients for the dough into a stand mixer. Alternatively, you could also use your hands if you&#039;ve got a bit more time. 
Process or knead until you&#039;ve got a soft and well incorporated dough that doesn&#039;t stick to your hands.
Form the dough to a small ball and place it in a bowl. 
Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise at room temperature (preferably at a warm place) for about 45 minutes. 
It should have about doubled in size after this time.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough. You could also use a baking dish (line it with parchment paper as well). 
Use your finger to poke dents all over the surface of the dough.
Let it rise for another 20 minutes. Preheat your oven to 400 F. 
Drizzle one tablespoon of olive oil on top. Then add the cherry tomatoes, the olives, and the fresh rosemary. Gently press them into the dough. Sprinkle with sea salt. 
Bake for 20 minutes at 400 F until golden. 
Cut into squares and serve warm. Drizzle extra olive oil on top, if you like.
