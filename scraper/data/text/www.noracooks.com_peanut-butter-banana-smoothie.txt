Ingredients:
2  bananas, cut into chunks and frozen
1/4 cup creamy peanut butter
1 cup vanilla soy milk, more if needed to blend
optional: 1-2 tablespoons natural cocoa powder

Instructions:
Place all ingredients in a high powered blender. If you want a chocolate peanut butter smoothie, add in the cocoa powder.
Blend on high until very smooth, adding more milk as needed. Don&#039;t add too much because you want the smoothie to be very thick and milkshake like.
Serve immediately and enjoy!
