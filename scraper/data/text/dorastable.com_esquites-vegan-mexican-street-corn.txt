Ingredients:
4 ears Corn (3 1/4 cups) (kernels cut off)
1 sprig Epazote (fresh)
2  Arbol chiles (dried)
2 cloves Garlic (minced)
½ cup Onion (diced)
1 ½ tbsp. Vegan butter
2-3 cups Vegetable stock
1/3 cup Primal Kitchen Vegan Mayo
1/3 cup Almond Crema
½ cup Vegan queso fresco or ( vegan queso cotija)
¼ cup Chile powder
2  Limes (cut into quarters)

Instructions:
Heat a large sauté pan to medium heat. Add butter, as soon as butter begins to melt add onion. Let cook for 3-4 minutes or until onion is tender and translucent.
Add garlic, stir, and continue to cook 2 more minutes or until you begin to smell the garlic.
Add corn, epazote, and chile de arbol. Stir to combine. Add vegetable broth, enough to barely cover the corn, and lower heat to a simmer. Simmer for about 8 min. or until the corn is tender. Season to taste with salt.
Drain some of the corn with a slotted spoon, and place it into cups. Add a squeeze of lime juice, 1 tbsp. vegan mayo, 1 tbsp. almond crema, 1 tbsp. Vegan queso fresco to each cup. Sprinkle some chile powder on top, and some more lime juice if needed. Serve immediately.
