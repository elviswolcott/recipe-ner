Ingredients:
3 tbsp vegan butter or oil
1 cup sooji ((semolina, not semolina flour))
5 tbsp cashews
10 to 12  dates (chopped)
8 to 10 tbsp sugar
1/8 tsp salt (, 1/4 tsp if using oil)

3 cups water

Instructions:
Press saute on the Instant Pot. When hot, add vegan butter or oil. Add cashews and roast for a minute.
Add dates and roast for half a minute. Add the semolina and cook for 2 mins, stirring occasionally. The semolina will start to get puffy.
Switch off saute. Add the sugar, salt, cardamom and saffron and mix.
Add water and mix well. You can also add 1/2 cup finely chopped pineapple or banana at this point to make pineapple kesari or banana kesari.
Mix to pick up all the semolina from the bottom and the sides. Mix for a few seconds so the sugar dissolves.
