Ingredients:
4 ounces raw cacao butter ((3/4 cup chopped small))
4 tablespoons vegetable shortening
3/4 cup powdered sugar
1/2 cup coconut milk powder
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
tiny pinch of salt, optional (1/8th tsp)

Instructions:
If your cacao butter comes in large chunks, chop them a bit smaller so they will melt more quickly.
In a heat safe bowl, add the cacao butter and shortening. Place the bowl on top of a small-medium sized pot with a few inches of simmering water. Make sure the bowl is not touching the water. Let it melt, stirring frequently. This will take about 10 minutes, and it will look like oil.
Now add the powdered sugar, powdered coconut milk, vanilla and a tiny pinch of salt. Whisk until fairly smooth, about 2 minutes.
Carefully, using hot pads, transfer the mixture to a blender and blend for 1-2 minutes until smooth. Pour into chocolate molds (I used these silicone molds). TIP! Place the molds on a flat surface like a baking sheet and move very carefully so they liquid chocolate doesn&#039;t spill out before it has a chance to harden.
Refrigerate until solid, about 30 minutes. You can also stick them in the freezer to speed this up. Enjoy! Store white chocolate in a covered container in the refrigerator or freezer.
