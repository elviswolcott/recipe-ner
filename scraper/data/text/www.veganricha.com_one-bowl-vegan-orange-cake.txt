Ingredients:
1 cup whole wheat pastry flour or use Spelt flour
1/2 cup unbleached white flour or all purpose flour
1 tbsp starch like corn or arrowroot
3/4 cup powdered sugar (I powder raw sugar and use, Add 2 to 4 tbsp more for sweeter.)
3/4 tsp baking soda
a generous pinch of salt
1 cup orange juice
2 tbsp oil
1 tsp vinegar
1 tsp vanilla extract

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F / 180Âºc. Line a 8 or 9 inch cake pan with parchment, or grease well and dust with flour.
In a bowl whisk all the dry ingredients until combined well.
Add the wet ingredients to the bowl and mix until smooth. Pour the batter in the prepared cake pan.
Bake for 30 to 35 minutes or a toothpick from near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes and remove from pan. Cool completely before slicing.
Add frosting of choice like vegan cream cheese frosting, or with whipped coconut cream and fruit, or make a boozy marmalade glaze.
For the boozy glaze: Mix a tbsp of liquor in a 1/4 cup of orange or apricot marmalade or preserves of choice. Heat for a few minutes until bubbling. Use as glaze or serve with each slice.
For a regular glaze: Use a tbsp orange juice mixed with the marmalade, or mix 2 to 3 tbsp orange juice with a 1/3 cup or more powdered sugar.
