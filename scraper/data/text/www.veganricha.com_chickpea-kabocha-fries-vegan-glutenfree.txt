Ingredients:
1/2 cup Chickpea flour (besan/garbanzo bean flour. You can also use garbanzo-fava bean flour)
1/3  cup well mashed roasted Kabocha squash (or any other squash or 1/3 cup mashed sweet potato)
3/4 cup water
1/3 tsp salt
1/2 tsp ranch seasoning (Garlic, Onion, Dill, Parsley, Chives and a touch of Pepper. or other spices of choice))
black pepper to taste

Instructions:
In a bowl or directly in the pan, add all the ingredients and whisk.
Heat the pan on low-medium heat and keep whisking to combine all the ingredients.
Whisk for 4-6 minutes until the batter starts get thick and stiff. You will be able to feel the stiffness and the batter will not move easily.
Drop the stiff batter onto parchment or greased sheet. Spread the batter quickly using a greased spatula keeping it 1/4-1/2 inch thick and let set for an hour in refrigerator.
Cut the set batter into strips. (At this point, the strips can be frozen. Thaw and proceed to grill/bake.)
Then either bake or pan fry or grill. Brush a little oil on the fries to grill.
Pan fry for 2-3 minutes each side on medium-high heat.
For Baked: Broil on Low for 4-5 minutes then broil on High for half a minute to a minute(depends on how crisp you want the fries). The fries can be baked or grilled without oil too.
I sprinkled some cajun spice on them and served with sriracha.
