Ingredients:
(2) 20 ounce cans young green jackfruit in brine (or water)
18 ounces barbecue sauce
6  hamburger buns (gluten free if needed)
vegan coleslaw (or shredded cabbage)

Instructions:
Prepare your jackfruit: Drain and rinse the canned jackfruit, then chop off the core portions and discard.
Add the jackfruit to the Instant Pot along with 1 cup of water. Put on the lid, seal, and set to high pressure for 5 minutes. Allow the pressure to release naturally, or if you are in a hurry you can manually release the pressure (carefully.)
Drain the jackfruit, and then add it back to the Instant Pot. Mash with a potato masher until it resembles pulled meat.
If using homemade, make the vegan barbecue sauce now.
Add the barbecue sauce to the pulled jackfruit, and turn on the saut√© feature. Cook for 2-5 minutes until warmed through. Serve on buns with shredded cabbage or coleslaw.
