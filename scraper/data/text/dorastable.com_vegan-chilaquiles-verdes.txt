Ingredients:
24  Corn tortillas (cut into 12th's)
Primal Kitchen Avocado Oil Spray
7  Tomatillos (medium (about 1 lb.), husks removed)
1/2  Onion
2 cloves Garlic (unpeeled)
1 -2  Jalapeños
 cup Chopped cilantro
1 tbsp. Primal Kitchen Avocado oil
Almond crema
Vegan queso fresco or queso cotija
  Onion, (thinly sliced)

Instructions:
Preheat oven to 350F and line a sheet tray with parchment paper.
Place tortillas on sheet tray and spray with avocado oil. Bake for 7 minutes and flip the tortillas. Continue to bake for another 7 minutes or until your tortillas are crispy and golden brown. The time will vary depending on the thickness of your tortilla. Set aside.
Fill a medium pot with water, add tomatillos, and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 15 minutes or until the tomatillos have changed to a dull green color and are soft.
While the tomatillos are cooking, heat a griddle or cast iron pan to high heat. Place all of the jalapeño, onion, and garlic on the griddle until they become soft and slightly blackened, about 7-10 min. (The garlic will be done before the peppers and onions are finished cooking. Simply remove them from the griddle).Flip the peppers, onion, and continue to char for another 5- 7 minutes. Remove ingredients from griddle and set aside. Peel the garlic.
Remove the tomatillos from the water and place in the blender with the charred jalapeño, onion, garlic, and cilantro. Blend until smooth, and season to taste with salt and pepper.
Heat a large sauté pan to medium-low heat. Add oil and pour in sauce. Let simmer for 5 minutes, then add the baked tortillas. Mix to coat the tortillas with the sauce. Serve on plates immediately, and top with almond crema, queso fresco, and onion.
