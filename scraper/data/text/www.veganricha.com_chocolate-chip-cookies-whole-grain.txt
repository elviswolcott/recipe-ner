1 Tbsp coconut oil (almost melted)
1 Tbsp organic canola oil
2.5 Tablespoons ground raw sugar (3 Tbsp for sweeter)

In a bowl, add hot water, almond milk, vanilla, flaxmeal and agave.
Whisk until well combined.
Add the oils and raw sugar, salt, whisk for a minute until well combined. Let sit for 2 minutes.
Whisk again for a few seconds.
Mix the baking powder in the wheat flour.
Add the flour and mix with a spoon or hand. you might have to knead it a bit for the oils to combine well with the flour. If the dough is wet, add a few teaspoons more flour.
Add the chocolate chips, knead to distribute.
Chill the dough for 15 minutes.
The dough will feel crumbly, but will come together when pressed and will smooth out a bit with the warmth of the hands. Some cracks are fine.
