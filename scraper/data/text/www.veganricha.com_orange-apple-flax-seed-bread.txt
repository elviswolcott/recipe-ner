Ingredients:
3-4 cup bread flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1.5 teaspoon quick rise yeast and .5 teaspoon regular yeast
1/2  medium apple pureed
2 Tablespoons Orange marmalade
2 teaspoons lime juice
3 Tablespoons flax seed crushed slightly
2 Tablespoons dark brown sugar
1 Tablespoon molasses
1 teaspoon salt
1 Tablespoon vegan butter
oil for greasing
2/3 cup water

Instructions:
Warm the water and add yeast to it. Let sit for 10 minutes or until frothy.
Puree the apple with little water, sugar and molasses.
Grease the mixer bowl and add 3 cups (390g) bread flour, 1 cup (130g) whole wheat flour, salt, flax seed and mix well.
Add in the yeast mixture, marmalade, softened butter and lime juice and knead for 10-12 minutes( 2-3 minute batches with occasional scraping)
Add more water or flour if needed. The apple will make the dougg more moist with time, so try to keep the dough a little on the dry side.
Place dough in well oiled container covered for 1.5 hours.
Punch it down and knead for a minute. Shape dough into a loaf by pulling on all sides and tucking under.
Place in bread pan, cover with kitchen towe and let rise for another 40 minutes.
Bake at 375 degrees F for 45-50 minutes or until nice a brown and sounds hollow.
Bread will have a nice dark crumb, which will be a bit hard right out of the oven, but will soften as the bread cools. Slice after the loaf has cooled completely.&nbsp;
