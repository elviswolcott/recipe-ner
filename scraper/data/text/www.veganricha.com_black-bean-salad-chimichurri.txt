Chop the veggies and add to a large bowl with the black beans.&nbsp;
Cook the cubed Sweet Potato and Corn: Bring to a boil in a medium saucepan then keep boiling for 5 minutes. Drain, cool for 2 minutes and use. Alternatively, toss with a tsp of oil and a pinch of salt. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15 minutes or until the potatoes are tender to preference (time will depend on the size of the potato cubes). Cool for 5 mins and add to the bowl with the beans.
Add salt, cumin (1/2 tsp or more) and black pepper to the bowl and toss well. I also add 1/4 tsp chipotle pepper for additional smoky flavor at times.&nbsp;
Make the Chimichurri sauce: Blend the ingredients under the sauce in a small blender with a few tbsp of water until smooth and creamy. Add 1-2 tbsp water to begin with and add more if needed. Taste and adjust salt, tang(lime). Add a pinch of sugar or maple to balance if needed. Store the sauce in an airtight contaainer refrigerated for upto 4 days.&nbsp;
Add some of the chimichurri sauce to the large bowl. Toss to combine. Taste and adjust, salt, flavor and sauce. Once dressed to preference, serve as is or with warmed tortillas to make tacos or wraps.&nbsp;
