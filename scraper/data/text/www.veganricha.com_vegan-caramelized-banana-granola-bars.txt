Ingredients:
4  bananas (, sliced into 1/2 cm thick slices)
1.5 cup nuts (, mix of walnuts cashews, almonds, pecans)
1 cup oats
6   dates
1/4 tsp salt
cinnamon

Instructions:
Place sliced bananas on a parchment lined baking sheet. Add oats and nuts to another baking dish. Bake the sliced banana  at 375 deg F (190 C) for 15 mins, Reduce temperature to 350 deg f (180 C) then add the nuts and oats to the oven and bake for another 15 mins. Let cool.
Alternatively, you can cook the bananas in aÂ  skillet with 2-3 tbsp non-dairy milk until caramelizing.
Add the toasted nuts and half of the oats to a food processor. Pulse to break the nuts into a coarse meal, then add dates along with the caramelized banana, and pulse to break down the bananas a bit. Add cinnamon, salt, the other half of the oats and pulse again until a dough like state. (If your dates are not very soft, process with the banana to break them down before this step)

Cool, slice and store refrigerated for up to 2 weeks.
