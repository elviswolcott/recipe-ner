Ingredients:
2 cups vegetable broth
3/4 teaspoon onion powder
3 tablespoons nutritional yeast
1 tablespoon soy sauce (or use tamari for gluten free)
1/2 teaspoon dijon mustard
1/4 cup all purpose flour (or use brown rice flour for gluten free)

Instructions:
Add all ingredients to a medium sized pot and bring to a boil.
Whisk over medium-high heat for a couple of minutes, until the gravy thickens.
Serve with mashed potatoes! This gravy keeps well for up to a week in the fridge. Just re-warm, add a little water if too thick, stir and serve.
