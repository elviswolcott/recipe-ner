Ingredients:
1/2  medium beet ((peeled and chopped into 1/8 inch cubes))
1 cup water
4 tablespoon raw sugar or jaggery ((raw granulated sugar is usually sweeter than powdered sugar))
1/4 teaspoon ginger powder
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon powder
2 teaspoons flax meal
1 tablespoon hot water
1-2 tablespoons Raw turbinado sugar or jaggery or sweetener of choice ((I used 1 Tbsp for mild sweetness.))
3 tablespoons sugar syrup ((beet syrup))
1 tablespoon roasted Cashew butter ((Homemade nut butter recipes))
1 tablespoon virgin coconut oil (or vegan butter like Earth Balance)
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1 tablespoons quinoa ((blended coarsely or quinoa flour ( or use oats coarse flour, if you don't have quinoa))
3 tablespoons oat flour ((Bobâ€™s Red Mill Organic Old Fashioned))
1/2 cup self rising flour
1/3 cup whole wheat pastry flour

Instructions:
In a pan, add a cup of water and bring to a boil. Add the sugar, and mix well. Simmer for 2 minutes.
Add in the chopped beet, cinnamon, ginger powder and cook on low heat for 30-40 minutes or until the syrup thickens and starts to bubble up and just about starts to crystallize.
I got about 5 Tablespoons of thick syrup with beet in it. You can remove the beet pieces and coat them with powdered sugar and keep refrigerated for a few weeks. I left them in the syrup, since I was going to use them within the next few days.
I used about 2/3 of the this mixture for the cookies, that is 3 Tablespoons of the syrup with beet pieces.
The remaining syrup went in some multigrain pancakes, which turned out an amazing. pink, fluffy with them fun beet chunks! My multigrain pancake recipe here.
