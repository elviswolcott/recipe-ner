Ingredients:
1  medium Kabocha or other winter squash
2 tsp oil
1.5 tsp berbere spice blend (or or garam masala)
1 tsp ground coriander
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp or more salt
cayenne to preference
1 tsp dried parsley
1  recipe tahini garlic dill sauce (or use tahini garlic sauce or vegan ranch from my book)
black pepper and parsley for garnish

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Clean the Squash and Poke a few deep knife cuts around the top area using a knife. Place on a baking sheet and bake for 35 to 45 minutes or until a knife goes through somewhat easily. The baking time depends on the size of the squash.
Take the squash out and let it cool for 15 minutes. Carefully slice into half. Scoop out the seeds and seed fibers using a spoon. Discard or save to make roasted seeds later. (see note)
Slice the roasted squash in thick slices.&nbsp;Spray or rub oil on the slices
In a bowl mix the berbere, coriander powder, garlic, onion, salt, dried parsley and cayenne if using.&nbsp; Sprinkle and rub the spice mix over the slices. Bake for another 5 to 10 minutes until golden on some edges.
Meanwhile, prepare the dressing of choice.&nbsp;Drizzle liberally over the roasted squash slices. Sprinkle some parsley or cilantro and some more berbere if you like. Alternately, serve the slices with the dressing on the side. Use garnishes like cranberries or other dried fruit to make it festive.&nbsp;
