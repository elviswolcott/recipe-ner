Ingredients:
2  cups  orzo
1  cup cherry tomatoes
1  handfull basil
1/2  cup black olives (I used about 15 black olives)
1/3  cup  artichokes in oil
2  green onions
1/2   block firm tofu (7 oz)
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1 teaspoon oregano
salt
pepper
1  garlic clove, minced
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
2 tablespoons water
1/3 cup sun dried tomatoes in oil (I used about 5 dried tomatoes)

Instructions:
Cut the tofu into cubes and marinate for at least an hour in a mixture of one tablespoon of olive oil and balsamic vinegar and one teaspoon of oregano.
Cook the orzo according to the instructions on the package.
Prepare the dressing: Place the sun dried tomatoes, the olive oil, the balsamic vinegar, and the garlic into a food processor and process until smooth.
Cut the cherry tomatoes and the olives in halves. Chop the green onions into rings. Cut the artichokes into small pieces. Chop the basil leaves.
Rinse the cooked orzo with cold water. Add the salad dressing and stir in the remaining ingredients.
Season with salt and pepper and let it sit for a while. If you want, add some more balsamic vinegar.
