Ingredients:
2  bananas
1/2 cup dark chocolate
1 teaspoon chia seeds
1-2 tablespoons coconut flakes
1/4 cup almonds, chopped
2 tablespoons coconut milk ((optional))

Instructions:
Fill the bottom of a sauce pan with water and bring to a simmer. Place the chocolate in a heat-resistant bowl and put it into the sauce pan. Let the chocolate melt, stirring occasionally, until the chocolate is completely melted. To make the chocolate smoother, add some coconut milk. Alternatively, melt the chocolate in the microwave.
While the chocolate is melting, cut the bananas into bite-sized pieces.
With a small spoon, drizzle some of the melted chocolate on top of each banana and sprinkle the banana pieces immediately with the chopped almonds, coconut flakes and chia seeds.
Stick a toothpick into each banana piece and put it into the freezer for about an hour. Let it thaw for about 5 minutes before serving.
