Ingredients:
3/4 cup buckwheat flour
3/4 cup all purpose flour, whole wheat pastry flour OR more buckwheat flour*
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons sugar
1 1/2  cups soy milk*
1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons neutral flavored oil, such as canola or melted coconut oil
1 teaspoon vanilla

Instructions:
In a large bowl, whisk together the buckwheat flour, regular flour (or more buckwheat for gluten free), baking powder, salt and sugar.Â 
Pour the soy milk, apple cider vinegar, oil and vanilla into the bowl with the dry ingredients, and stir with a large spoon until just combined. A few lumps are okay; do not over mix or your pancakes won&#039;t be as fluffy.
Heat a large griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Grease the pan with vegan butter or coconut oil, and drop about 1/3 cup of the batter onto it. Cook until bubbles form, then flip and cook until golden brown on the other side, about 1-2 minutes. Repeat with all the remaining batter.
Serve buckwheat pancakes with maple syrup, vegan butter or peanut butter and some fresh fruit. Enjoy!
Leftovers: Store pancakes in the refrigerator in a covered container for 4-5 days or freeze them for longer.
