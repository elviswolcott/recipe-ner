Ingredients:
3/4 cup granulated sugar
6 tablespoons natural unsweetened cocoa powder
3 tablespoons cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 1/2 cups unsweetened soy milk
2 tablespoons vegan butter
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon espresso powder (optional)

Instructions:
In a medium pot, add the sugar, cocoa, cornstarch and salt. Whisk to combine.
Turn the heat to medium heat. Slowly stir in the milk, whisking well to remove all clumps.
Bring the mixture to a simmer. Once simmering, stir constantly for 2 minutes, until the pudding thickens somewhat. It won&#39;t be quite as firm as pudding yet, as it will thicken up as it chills.
Remove from heat. Stir in the vegan butter, vanilla and espresso powder, if using, until the butter has melted and the pudding is smooth.
Pour or spoon the pudding into a container (or multiple containers.) Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on top of the pudding, to prevent a skin from forming as it chills.
Place in the refrigerator to chill for a few hours until cold. Serve with optional vegan whipped cream/coconut cream and perhaps some mini chocolate chips.
