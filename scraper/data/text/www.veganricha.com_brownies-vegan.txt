Ingredients:
1/3 cup Self rising flour
2/3 cup whole wheat pastry flour
3 Tablespoons cocoa powder ((1 Tablespoon more for darker))
5 Tablespoons chocolate chips/cacao nibs
2 Tablespoons coconut oil
4 Tablespoons olive oil
2 teaspoons flax meal
1/2 cup water
4  mejbool dates chopped or pureed ((can be substituted by 2 Tablespoons sugar))
2 Tablespoons Agave syrup
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon vanilla extract or instant coffee (or any mild spice)
5 Tablespoons raw sugar or jaggery

Instructions:
Soak the dates without pits in warm water for half an hour.
In a blender, blend dates, sugar, salt, lemon juice, agave, oils, flax, cocoa powder with 1/3 cup of water.
In a bowl, add the flours and the chocolate chips. Add the date puree.
Mix till just about combined. Add more water if needed to get a thick batter. Taste batter and adjust sweetness to taste(since I usually make my baked goods mildly sweet). You can adjust the cocoa powder too. The color of the brownie will be a mildy deeper shade of the batter. Add nuts if you like. I added some chopped almonds in the brunette version.
Drop and smooth batter in prepared pan.
Bake for 15-20 minutes till top is not jiggly and a toothpick inserted comes out almost clean. The darker batch was baked to just about done and looks gooey, while the brunette batch was baked a bit more( and also had a little baking powder) and looks more cakey.
Cool on rack before slicing. Serve with vegan icecream or fruit compote or melted chocolate !
You can chop up the dates and add to the brownie instead of the date puree. Add 2-3 Tablespoons more oil for a gooeyier brownie. Have a fantastic day!
