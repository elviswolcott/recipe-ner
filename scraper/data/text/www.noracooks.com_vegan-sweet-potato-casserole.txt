Ingredients:
9 cups peeled and chopped sweet potatoes, about 4 large
1 cup full fat coconut milk (from a can)
1 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
3/4 teaspoon  salt
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
2/3 cup brown sugar
5 tablespoons vegan butter, softened to room temperature
1/2 cup all purpose flour (or gluten free all purpose)
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup chopped pecans

Instructions:
Add the sweet potatoes to a large pot, cover with water and bring to a boil. Cook for 10-15 minutes until the potatoes are fork tender. Drain, then add them back to the pot or a large bowl.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and lightly grease a 9 x 13 casserole dish.
To the large pot or bowl with the cooked sweet potatoes, add the coconut milk, brown sugar, vanilla, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg and mash with a potato masher. Continue to mash or stir with a spoon until well combined. You can also use a hand mixer.
Spread the potato mixture in the prepared dish, and smooth it out evenly with a spatula.
Make the topping: In a medium bowl, stir all the topping ingredients, except the pecans, together with a spoon. Use your hands if necessary until moist crumbs form. Now mix in the pecans.
Evenly sprinkle the topping on the sweet potato filling and bake for 35-45 minutes, until bubbly on the edges and the topping is golden brown. Serve immediately!
