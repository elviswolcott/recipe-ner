Ingredients:
3/4 cup peanut butter (at room temp (I like smooth unsweetened nut butter))
1/3 cup coconut sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 tbsp maple syrup
1/8 tsp salt
4 tbsp chopped dark chocolate or a mix of dark chocolate and mini chocolate chips
1.5 cup rice krispies or chocolate rice krispies
2 tsp oil or maple syrup to help bind (optional, as needed)

Instructions:
Add peanut butter, coconut sugar, vanilla, maple syrup to the food processor, process for a minute to mix the sugar.
Add chocolate, salt, 1 cup krispies and pulse to mix and break most of them. Add the remaining rice krispies and pulse to mix and break half of the krispies.
Shape using hands or a scoop. Hands will warm the nut butter making it easier to bind. If using a scoop you might need to addÂ maple or oil so that the mixture sticks easily as some nut butters are dryer.
Shape, chill for a few mins and serve. Store refrigerated for upto 2 weeks, freeze for upto a month.
