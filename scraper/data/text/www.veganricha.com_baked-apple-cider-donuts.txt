Ingredients:
1.5 cups  + 2 tbsp apple cider (not vinegar, but the fermented apple drink)
1/4 cup sugar ((coconut sugar, date sugar, regular or use maple syrup), 1/3 cup for sweeter)
1 cup flour ((I use a mix of 1/4 cup whole wheat and 3/4 cup all purpose), see note for gluten-free)
1 tbsp almond flour (, or use more flour)
3/4 tsp cinnamon
1/8 tsp cardamom or nutmeg
dash of black pepper
1/4 tsp salt
1 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1 tbsp oil or applesauce ((or both for extra moisture when using whole grain flours))
1 tbsp cane sugar
1 tbsp coconut sugar or brown sugar
1/2 tsp cinnamon

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 deg F(180 C). Grease a donut pan or line muffin pan. Cook 1.5 cups cider and sugar in a saucepan over medium heat for 20 to 25 mins to reduce to a scant 1 cup. Cool the cider to room temp. (cooling will reduce the cider further to about 3/4 cup + 2 tbsp)
In a bowl, mix the rest the dry ingredients. Add the concentrated cider and oil/applesauce. Mix well to combine. If the batter is too thick, mix in non dairy milk 1 tbsp at a time until it is just a bit flowy to be able to spoon it in. If the batter is too thin, add in 1-2 tbsp flour
Immediately spoon the batter into the donut pan or muffin pan. Even out the batter for even shape for donuts.
Bake for 11-12 mins for donuts or mini muffins, 20-22 mins for regular muffins. Cool for 5 mins, then release from the pan.
Mix the cinnamon sugar into a ziplock.(or add to a shallow bowl)
Cool the donuts for another 5 mins. Brush donuts with the non dairy milk or cider, or use oil/melted vegan butter. Add to the ziplock and shake, or dipÂ in the sugar mixture.
