Ingredients:
1/2 cup vegan butter, melted
3/4 cup granulated sugar
3/4 cup brown sugar
5 tablespoons soy milk
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
1 cup all purpose flour (or gluten free mix)
3/4 cup natural unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup non-dairy chocolate chips

Instructions:
Preheat oven to 350â„‰ and spray a non-stick mini muffin pan with oil. This will help the brownie bites come out easily.
In a large bowl, stir the melted vegan butter and sugar together until combined. Now add the soy milk and vanilla and stir to combine.
Over the bowl with the wet ingredients, sift in the flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt. Stir with a large spoon until just combined. Fold in the chocolate chips.
Using a cookie scoop or spoon, add about 1 1/2 tablespoons of batter to each mini muffin cup and press down with your fingers.
Bake for 12-15 minutes, until the tops look crinkly and done. Let the brownies cool in the pan for 20-30 minutes, then run a knife along the edge of each brownie to help lift it out of the pan. Do this gently so they do not break. Let the brownies cool on a cooling rack before serving. Enjoy!
