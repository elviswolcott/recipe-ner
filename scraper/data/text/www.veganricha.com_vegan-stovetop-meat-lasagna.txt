Ingredients:
1 teaspoon oil
1/2 cup chopped onion
2 cloves garlic (minced)
1/2 teaspoon  dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teasoon dried basil
1 cup veggie crumbles
1/4 teaspoon fennel seeds
1/4 teaspoon pepper flakes
1-2 tsp balsamic vinegar
1/4 teaspoon salt
18 oz marinara sauce (or pasta sauce )
5-7  Regular lasagna noodles, broken  (7 if you're using no boil)
2 cups water or broth (2 1/2 cups for saucier )
1/2 tsp salt
1 cup or more of vegan cheese shreds (or use a cup of my cashew mozzarella.)
1 cup chopped spinach  (optional )

Instructions:
Heat a large skillet** over medium heat, add oil, then add in the onion, garlic, mix in, and cook until the onion is translucent, then add in the herbs, crumbles, fennel seeds, balsamic and salt, and mix in.
Cook until the crumbles are golden on the edges, 3-5 minutes.
Remove half of the crumbles from the skillet, to add later, then add in the pasta sauce, and mix in.
Cook for 2 minutes to heat through, then add in the water, salt, and mix in.
Break lasagna noodles and add them into the mixture, and press, so that all the lasagna noodles are covered in the water/sauce mixture. Cover and cook for 15-20minutes, or until the lasagna noodles are cooked to preference. Stir once in between. If your noodles are sticking to the pan or the sauce is thickening too much, add in 1/2 cup hot water and mix in.
Open the lid, check the noodles and taste for salt and adjust, add in spinach if using and fold in. Then sprinkle the rest of the veggie crumbles, and top it with the vegan cheese, cover, and cook for another 2-4 minutes, to melt the cheese
Open the skillet, switch off heat, garnish with pepper flakes and fresh basil, and serve
