Ingredients:
1-2  tablespoons olive oil
1 medium yellow onion, chopped small
2 medium carrots, peeled and finely diced
1 stalk celery, finely diced
6-8 cloves garlic, minced
28 ounces canned crushed tomatoes
15 ounce can tomato sauce
3 tablespoons tomato paste
2 tablespoons dried basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste
1/2-1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, optional
2 cups uncooked red lentils
2 cups water, more as needed to thin sauce
1 pound spaghetti or other pasta
Vegan Parmesan

Instructions:
In a large skillet or pot, warm the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, carrots and celery and saut√© for 5-6 minutes until softened.
Now add the minced garlic and cook for 1 more minute until fragrant.
Pour in the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, basil, oregano, sugar, salt and optional red pepper flakes. Stir well until smooth and combined.
Add the lentils and 2 cups of water to the pot and stir well. Bring the mixture to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 25-30 minutes. Stir every 5-10 minutes to make sure the lentils don&#039;t stick to the bottom and burn. Add another 1/2 cup water or so if needed to thin the sauce if it gets too thick.
The lentils should be tender and the sauce thick and flavorful. Serve over spaghetti or other pasta of choice and sprinkle with vegan parmesan if desired. Enjoy!
