Ingredients:
15 ounces canned chickpeas, drained and rinsed (1 1/2 cups)
3/4 cup brown sugar
1/3 cup creamy peanut butter
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/4 cup almond flour
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup non-dairy chocolate chips, divided

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a 8 by 8 inch pan with parchment paper.
In a food processor, add all the ingredients except the chocolate chips and blend until very smooth, stopping to scrape the sides as needed.
Fold in half of the chocolate chips with a spoon. Transfer to the prepared pan and spread the batter evenly. I usually wet my hands and press down gently, or use a spatula.
Sprinkle the last 1/4 cup chocolate chips on top of the batter. Bake for 25-30 minutes.
Let them cool at least 10 minutes before serving. Enjoy! I like to store leftover bars in the refrigerator; they will last up to 1 week this way and they taste good cold. Or store in a covered container at room temperature for 2-3 days.
