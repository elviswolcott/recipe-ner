Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups vital wheat gluten
1/3 cup all purpose flour
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups vegan chikn flavored broth or vegetable broth*
2 tablespoons olive oil

Instructions:
In a large bowl, combine the vital wheat gluten, flour, nutritional yeast, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika and salt. Stir to combine.
To the bowl with the dry ingredients, pour in the broth and oil. Stir well until the mixture starts to pull away from the bowl.
Transfer to a lightly floured surface, and knead with your hands for just a minute until it comes together, not too much. It will still be quite messy, not a smooth dough.
Break into 6 pieces and press gently into circles, or &quot;chicken&quot; shapes. They can all be different and they don&#039;t have to be perfect, just try to make them similar sizes so they cook evenly.
Wrap each piece in foil. Place all 6 pieces in a steamer basket with water on the bottom and steam for 30 minutes.
Remove carefully from the foil. Now you can either pan fry them in a little vegan butter or oil, grill them, or slice and use anywhere you would like. Enjoy!
