Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups uncooked cubed potatoes
1 1/2 cups uncooked cubed carrots
5  pickled jalapeños
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1/2 cup nutritional yeast
1 tablespoon yellow miso paste
1/2 cup unsweetened non-dairy milk  ((almond or soy milk))
1/4 cup cashews ((unsalted and not roasted))
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 cup canola oil or olive oil
1/2 teaspoon hot sauce
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika powder

Instructions:
Peel the potatoes and the carrots. Cut them into small cubes. Cook until soft. I usually use my Instant Pot to cook them.&nbsp;
Once the potatoes and the carrots are soft, transfer them to a high speed blender together with the remaining ingredients.&nbsp;
Process until smooth. This will take about a minute.&nbsp;
Transfer to a small pot and cook for a minute. The vegan nacho sauce will thicken up when being heated. 
Serve with nachos and sprinkle with chopped jalapeños. I also added a bit of salsa in the middle of the bowl. Enjoy!&nbsp;
