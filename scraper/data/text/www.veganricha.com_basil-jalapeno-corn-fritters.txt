Ingredients:
2 loaded cups frozen sweet corn (thawed, or fresh corn off the cob)
1  Jalapeno (seeded and finely chopped, or use Serrano pepper (remove seeds for less heat))
1/4 cup chopped basil (or use cilantro)
1/4 cup finely chopped red onion
1 tsp lime juice
1/3  tsp salt (, 1/3 to 1/2)
1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 cup white rice flour
3 tbsp or more cornmeal
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 cup or more water

Instructions:
In a bowl, add all the ingredients corn through baking powder including the baking powder. Toss well to distribute.
Add water and mix. Add enough water until the mixture is pasty but not a batter. There will be more corn than batter. (Add a tbsp of flaxseed meal to the mix if the fritters dont hold up too well on the skillet in the next step)
Heat a skillet over medium heat. Spray or spread oil on the skillet. Drop large spoonfuls of the mixture on the hot skillet and spread to make a roundish shape. Cook until golden brown on both sides. 4 to 5 minutes per side.
Repeat for all fritters. Serve with chutneys, ketchup, guacamole or vegan ranch.
