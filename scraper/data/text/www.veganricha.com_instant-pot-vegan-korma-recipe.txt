Ingredients:
7  oz tofu, cubed (, or use other veggies such as cauliflower (1.5 to 2 cups))
8 oz Sweet potatoes, cubed
1/2 tsp garam masala
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp salt
2 tsp oil (, divided)
3  green Cardamom Pods
4-5  cloves
1  Bay leaf
1 tsp poppy seeds
1 tsp coriander powder
1/2 to 1 tsp garam masala
1/3 tsp ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp salt
1/3 tsp cayenne
1  medium or small onion
1 inch ginger
6 cloves of garlic
1/4 cup cashews (,use pumpkin seeds for nut-free, other nuts for cashew-free)
1/4 to 1/3 cup non dairy yogurt
1/2 cup water (+ 1/2 cup water for rinsing)
1 cup other veggies, chopped small (, I use quick cooking veggies as broccoli, peppers, zucchini, peas )
2 tbsp roasted cashew ((optional))
1 tbsp raisins or dates

Instructions:
Toss tofu, sweet potatoes in 1 tsp oil. Sprinkle in the spices and mix. Place on parchment lined baking sheet. Bake at 400 degrees F (205 C) for 20 to 25 mins.
Blend the korma sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water until coarsely blended.
Add oil to the Instant Pot on saute.&nbsp;When hot, add the korma sauce. Cook for 2 minutes, to bring to a boil and simmer for another few seconds. This allows the pungency of the onion to cook out. Use 1/2 cup water to rinse out the blender and add to the pot. Mix well so there isn't anything stuck to the bottom. Close the lid
Pressure cook at high pressure for 11 mins. Let the pressure release naturally.
Open the lid and mix. At this point you can store this sauce. (Simmer with tempeh, seitan, vegan meat/chickin subs, some non dairy milk and salt depending on the addition used.)
Add the baked tofu and sweet potato. Add the other quick cooking veggies (or a cup of cooked chickpeas), 1/4 cup or more non dairy milk(for saucier) and 1/4 tsp salt. Mix and cook on saute for 2-3 minutes to bring to a good boil and cook for another minute. Mix frequently to avoid sticking. Taste and adjust salt. Add a 1/4 tsp or more sugar/ sweetener if needed.
Cancel and let the mixture sit in the pot for 5 mins so the veggies cook through and the flavors develop. Add 1-2 tbsp&nbsp; roasted cashews or other nuts/seeds and 1-2 tbsp of dried fruit such as raisins or finely chopped dates and mix in (optional).
Garnish with cilantro and pepper flakes and serve over rice or Naan.Refrigerate(just the sauce or veggie korma) for upto 4 days. Freeze for upto a month.&nbsp;
