Ingredients:
1/4 cup oil (neutral oil like safflower)
1/4 cup molasses
3 Tbsp non dairy milk
1/2 cup coconut sugar  (or ground raw sugar)
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp ground ginger
1/4 tsp ground cloves
1 cup Oat flour
3/4 cup finely ground almonds
1/2 cup rice flour (white or brown)
1 Tbsp cornstarch  (or arrowroot starch)
1 tsp baking soda
3/4 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
2 to 3 Tbsp chopped candied ginger
3 Tbsp granulated sugar
1 Tbsp coconut sugar
1 tsp cinnamon or chai spice (optional)

Instructions:
In a bowl, combine all the wet ingredients and whisk until the sugar dissolves. 1 to 2 minutes.
In another bowl, mix all the dry ingredients. Whisk well.
Add dry to wet and and mix to make a soft somewhat sticky dough. Let the dough sit for 5 minutes. Pre-heat the oven to 360 degrees F / 180c.
In a bowl, mix the ingredients to coat.
(If the dough is too sticky, add a Tbsp or more oat flour and mix in into the dough). Grease your hands and take 2 to 2.5 Tbsp of the dough, roll it into a smooth ball, coat in sugar mixture. Place on parchment lined sheet and flatten slightly.
Put a drop of water in the center of each cookie. Bake for 11 to 13 minutes or until the top is set.
Cool completely before serving (15 to 20 mins). The cookies keep cooking and pick up the sweetness from the sugar coating as they sit.
