Ingredients:
1 cup Brown rice (long grain)
¼  Onion (white)
3 cloves Garlic
1 ½ cups Tomato (diced)
1 tbsp. Tomato paste
1 ½ cups Vegetable (stock or broth)
½ tsp. Salt (kosher)
1 cup Peas (frozen)

Instructions:
Soak the brown rice in cold water overnight.
Drain the rice. Set a medium pot to medium heat and add the rice. Stir often and let rice toast until golden brown, about 8-10 min.
Meanwhile blend the tomato, onion, garlic, and tomato paste until smooth. Strain. You should end up with 1 cup of puree. If you don’t, add enough veg stock to make it one cup.
Pour the tomato puree into the pot with the rice and let simmer for 2 minutes. Add the 1 ½ cups of vegetable stock. Add ½ tsp of salt and stir. Cover and turn heat down to a low simmer. Let cook for 35 – 40 minutes.
Remove pan from heat and let rest covered for 7 minutes.
Meanwhile drop peas in boiling water until tender, about 1 minute, drain.
Add peas to rice and fluff with fork.
