Ingredients:
2 Tablespoons agave syrup
2 Tablespoons orange marmalade (or orange zest and 2 Tablespoons agave/maple)
2 Tablespoons ground raw sugar (or sweetener of choice)
2 Tablespoons coconut milk
1/8 teaspoon sea salt
1/8 teaspoon ginger powder (optional)
1 cup dried coconut flakes
1/4 cup brown rice flour (or other flour of choice. I usually use spelt if not making gf)
3/4 teaspoon baking powder (optional)
1/4 cup each or more of cranberries and chopped pistachios

Instructions:
In a bowl, mix all the wet ingredients.
Add in the dry and mix well.
Chill dough for 15 minutes.
(If the dough is very wet and squishy after chilling, add a bit more dry ingredients -coconut flakes and flour to make it into a slightly stiff but not dry dough)
Using a scoop or Tablespoon measure, scoop out the mixture. Scoop it out so it gets tightly packed. Or press with your fingers before placing on parchment.
Invert the scoop and tap to place on parchment.
Dip the scoop in water before every scoop for less mess. or grease with oil after every 2-3 scoops.
Bake at preheated 350 degrees F / 180c for 14-16 minutes depending on the size of the scoop until slightly golden.
They burn very easily, so keep an eye after 14 minutes. Turn the sheet around at 14 minutes.
Cool for 5 minutes, devour.
