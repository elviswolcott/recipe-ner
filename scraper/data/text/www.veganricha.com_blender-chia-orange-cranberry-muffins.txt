Ingredients:
1 cup orange juice
2 tbsp oil
zest of 1/2 an orange
1/2 cup sugar (scant) (I usually use a combination of coconut and unrefined raw sugar)
 tsp vanilla extract
3 to 4 tbsp chia seeds
1 1/4 cup flour (I use 3/4 cup spelt/ whole wheat and 1/2 cup white)
1/4 tsp baking soda
2 tsp baking powder
 tsp salt
1/2 cup frozen cranberries

Instructions:
Blend the wet ingredients except chia seeds. Fold in chia seeds and let sit for 10 mins to hydrate the seeds a bit.
Line a muffin pan with muffin liners. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F / 190c.
Add the dry ingredients to the blender and pulse a few times to combine. Alternatively, add and whisk all the dry ingredients in a bowl. Add to wet and mix to combine. The batter should be somewhat flowy but not runny. If too runny, add a tbsp or more flour and mix in.
Drop the batter into lined muffin pan. Add cranberries or other berries on top. Sprinkle some chia seeds on top (optional).
Bake for 20 to 22 mins.
Cool for 5 minutes in the pan then a few minutes on the counter before serving. The muffins can be kept on the counter (covered) for the day, or refrigerated upto 5 days.
