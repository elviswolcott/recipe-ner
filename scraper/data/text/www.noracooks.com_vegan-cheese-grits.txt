Ingredients:
2 cups vegetable broth
2 cups water
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 cup nutritional yeast
1 cup corn grits (*I used Bob&#039;s Red Mill)
1/4 cup vegan butter
Optional: 1/2 cup vegan cheddar cheese shreds

Instructions:
In a medium sized pot, bring vegetable broth, water, garlic powder and nutritional yeast to a boil.
Add grits slowly and whisk it in to prevent clumps. Cook uncovered over low-medium heat, stirring frequently, for about 20 minutes until thick and creamy.
Remove from heat and stir in vegan butter and optional cheese until melted. Add salt to taste as desired. Serve and enjoy!
