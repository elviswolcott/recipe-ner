Ingredients:
1  red onion
2  cloves of garlic, minced
3  bell peppers  ((I used different red, yellow, and green ones))
2 cans of black beans
1 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika powder
juice of half a lime
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste
6  large corn tortillas or several smaller ones
2 tablespoons olive oil or canola oil
2  tablespoons all-purpose flour or gluten-free flour blend
1 28 oz can crushed tomatoes
1 teaspoon cumin
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste
3/4 cup vegan cheese
green onions
fresh cilantro or parsley
red pepper flakes

Instructions:
Finely chop the onion and cut the bell peppers into small pieces.
Heat some oil in a large pan and sauté the onion and the garlic for about 2-3 minutes. Then add the bell pepper and cook for another 4 minutes.
Drain and rinse the canned black beans or use home-cooked beans. Place them in a large bowl and mash them with a potato masher. Leave some beans intact for texture.
Add the onion, garlic, and bell pepper mixture to the mashed beans. Season with cumin, smoked paprika powder, lime juice, salt, and pepper.
Fill the tortillas with the bean bell pepper mixture and roll them up.
Lightly spray a baking dish with non-stick spray. Place the enchiladas seam side down in the baking dish. Preheat your oven to 350 °F.
Now make the vegan enchilada sauce. Heat two tablespoons of oil in a large pan. Then add two tablespoons of flour and cook for about 2 minutes. Stir constantly and be careful not to burn it. Then add the crushed tomatoes and the spices. Cook for 5 minutes.
Pour the enchilada sauce over the enchiladas and spread evenly.&nbsp;
Sprinkle with vegan cheese.
Bake the enchiladas at 350 °F for 25 minutes. Sprinkle with chopped cilantro and green onions. If you don't like fresh cilantro, you can replace it with parsley. Serve immediately.
