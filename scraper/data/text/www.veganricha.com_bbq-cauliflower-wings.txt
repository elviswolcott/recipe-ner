Ingredients:
1/2 cup rice flour
2 tablespoons tapioca starch  (or corn starch)
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
2 teaspoons bbq seasoning  (or use 1 teaspoon paprika, 1/4 teaspoon onion powder, and 1/4 teaspoon each of oregano, thyme, and parsley)
1/2 cup of beer or use neutral club soda (or use water )
1 tsp oil
4 cups cauliflower florets ( or 1 small head of cauliflower chopped into florets)
1/2 cup bbq sauce (or more )
2 teaspoons hot sauce

Instructions:
In a bowl, add all the dry ingredients and mix well. Then add in the beer and 1 teaspoon oil to make the batter. The batter should be not be too thin. If it is not thick enough, you can add in a teaspoon or more of rice flour.
Once the batter is smooth, add in the cauliflower and toss well to coat.
Once the cauliflower is completely coated, transfer it to a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake at 425 degrees Fahrenheit(220c ) Â for 25 minutes.
Check at 21 or 22 minutes to see if the cauliflower is done and is tender inside. If it is, then you can remove the cauliflower.
Add bbq sauce and hot sauce to a shallow bowl and mix.
Add the cauliflower to the bowl where you mixed the bbq sauce and hot sauce and toss well to coat.
Transfer the cauliflower back onto the baking sheet and bake for another 5-7 minutes.
Serve hot. Garnish with some green onions and serve with ranch if desired
