Ingredients:
4  buns
5 oz plant milk (I used oat milk, but soy or almond is fine as well)
3 tablespoons nutritional yeast
2 tablespoons soy flour
1 tablespoon parsley,finely chopped
1 teaspoon salt
1  onion, chopped
2 cups fresh spinach
1 pinch nutmeg
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 tablespoons water
1  onion, chopped
1  glove garlic, minced
1  celery, finely chopped
1 stalk celery, finely chopped
3/4 cup red lentils
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 can diced tomatoes (14,5 oz)
2 cups vegetable broth
1 teaspoon oregano
1 teaspoon basil
salt
pepper

Instructions:
Cut the buns into small pieces. In a bowl, combine them with oat milk, nutritional yeast, soy flour, chopped parsley, and salt and knead together.
Wash the spinach. In a medium skillet, heat the olive oil and sauté the onions for about 3 minutes. Then add the spinach together with the water and cover with a lid. Wait until the spinach wilts and season with a pinch of nutmeg and pepper.
Stir the spinach in the dumpling dough and form about 6 small balls. Cook in salted water for about 10 minutes (on very low heat).
Make the lentil Bolognese: In a skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Sauté the onion for about 3 minutes. Then add the carrots, celery, and garlic and cook for 3 more minutes. Stir in the lentils and the tomate paste and sauté for another 2 minutes. Deglaze with red wine and allow the wine to reduce.
Add the diced tomatoes and the vegetable broth and cook the sauce for about 20 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, oregano, and basil. Serve together with the vegan spinach-bread dumplings and a green side salad.
