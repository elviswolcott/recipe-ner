Ingredients:
1  long or large eggplant  (sliced into 1/4-inch thick slices)
1  zucchini  (sliced a 1/4-inch thick slices)
1/2  red onion  (sliced into 1/8 inch thick slices or into 1/4-inch thick wedges)
1  red bell pepper ( sliced into 1/4-inch thick slices)
oil as needed
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes
1/2 cup Fresh basil
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 tablespoon olive oil
6-7 tablespoons water
4  bread slices

Instructions:
Prep your grill pan or the outdoor grill.
Once hot, brush the grill pan with oil then place the sliced vegetables on the pan. Brush some oil on the veggies. Sprinkle a little bit of salt and pepper and cook.
Press the veggies occasionally. You can use a spatula to press these vegetables down or use heavy grill weight. You can use skewers or toothpicks to keep the onion together
Cook until the vegetables have good golden brown stripes on them. Flip and continue to cook.
Meanwhile, make the sun dried tomato Â spread: Add everything to the blender and a 1/4 cup of water and blend.
Let the mixture sit for 2-3 minutes then blend again and then add water, 1 tablespoon at a time until the mixture is a spreadable consistency. Taste and adjust salt and flavor.
Toast your bread slices. Apply the spread on both of the slices. Then top the grilled vegetables on top of the one slice then place another slice on top and serve.
