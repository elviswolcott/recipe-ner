Ingredients:
1/4 cup water
1 tsp sugar or maple syrup
1 Tbsp active yeast
1 cup ripe strawberries (fresh or thawed if frozen)
1/2 cup non dairy milk like almond or coconut
2 tsp vanilla extract
3 Tbsp raw sugar  (or other sweetener)
2 1/4 to 2 1/2 cup flour (I use unbleached white flour)
1/2 cup oat flour
2/3 tsp salt
1 tsp baking powder
1 to 2 tbsp oil
1 Tbsp oil  (or melted vegan butter or oil spray)
1 to 2 tsp cinnamon
1/2  to 3/4 cup vegan chocolate chips
2 Tbsp or more sugar
1/4 cup non dairy milk
1/3  to 1/2 cup vegan chocolate chips
1 tsp vanilla extract

Instructions:
In a bowl, combine water, 1 tsp sugar and yeast. Let it sit for 2 minutes or until frothy.
Blend the strawberries with non dairy milk, vanilla and sugar until smooth and keep aside. (warm this mixture to room temperature if the strawberries were frozen)
In a bowl, add flours, salt, baking powder and whisk well. Add the yeast mixture, strawberry puree and oil. Mix and knead into a soft, somewhat sticky dough.
Use flour to roll the dough out into a 10 by 16 inch rectangle.
Brush vegan butter or oil. Sprinkle cinnamon, distribute the chocolate chips. Sprinkle sugar if you like the filling sticky sweet.
Roll up the rectangle into a jelly roll and seal the edges. Slice into 1 inch slices. Place in 8 by 8 square pan.
Spray water on top. Then spray oil. cover with a towel and let rise for 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F / 190Âºc. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until golden on top. Cool for 5 minutes then remove from the pan. Lightly cover with a towel to cool for another 5-10 minutes, then glaze and serve.
