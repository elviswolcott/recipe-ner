Ingredients:
1 cup puffed quinoa (or use puffed millet or puffed rice if you cant find quinoa)
1 cup puffed millet
1/2 cup Old fashioned Oats (Use gluten-free certified oats to ensure they are gf. Or use more puffed grains)
1 cup raw peanuts (raw or roasted (or Use a cup of mixed seeds to make nut-free))
1/4 cup cranberries or raisins
2 Tablespoons candied ginger small pieces
1/4 cup dried shredded coconut (unsweetened, small flakes)
2 Tablespoons sesame seeds
a generous dash of black pepper
1 tsp oil (extra virgin olive or coconut)
2 Tablespoons Sriracha (I used 3 Tbsps :) or use Asian chili paste like Sambal Oelek)
2 tsps soy sauce (use coconut aminos for soy-free)
2 Tablespoons maple or agave syrup
2 Tablespoons ground raw sugar  (or maple sugar)
1/2 tsp salt
2 tbsp loaded almond butter (or peanut butter)
2 tsps toasted sesame oil
zest of half an orange
.

Instructions:
In a pan, add oil, sriracha, soy sauce, maple syrup, sugar and salt and bring to a boil on medium heat. Boil for 2-3 minutes at low-medium heat. Take off heat and mix in the almond butter, sesame oil and zest. Mix to a smooth consistency.
In another bowl, add all the dry ingredients and mix to distribute evenly. Mix the wet into the dry and combine well.
Spread on a large baking sheet(or 2 medium). Bake at 325 degrees F / 160c for 20-25 minutes. Move the granola around with a spatula, 2-3 times in between, so the edges do not burn and it bakes evenly. Press them into clumps after removing from the oven. Let cool completely before storing
