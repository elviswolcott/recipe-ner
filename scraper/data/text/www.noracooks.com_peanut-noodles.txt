Ingredients:
1/2 cup natural peanut butter, smooth
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce  ((tamari for gluten free))
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice (1 lime)
3 tablespoons pure maple syrup
1 teaspoon Sriracha hot sauce
7 ounces brown rice stir fry noodles
2 cups cabbage or Trader Joe's cruciferous crunch
2  carrots, peeled and chopped into matchsticks
1  red bell pepper, thinly sliced
2  green onions, chopped
1/4 cup chopped cilantro
1/4 cup chopped peanuts

Instructions:
Make the Peanut Sauce: In a medium bowl, whisk together all sauce ingredients until smooth. Set aside.
Prepare the noodles: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, add the noodles and cook for 1 minute, then remove from heat and let soak for 5 minutes. Drain and rinse well. (If using other noodles, prepare according to package instructions.)
Cook the veggies: In the same pot you boiled the noodles in, add a few tablespoons of water (or olive oil). Add the cabbage, carrots, red pepper and green onions and cook for about 1 minute, stirring constantly.&nbsp;
Mix it all together: Now add the noodles and peanut sauce. Mix until warm and combined. Serve immediately with cilantro and chopped peanuts on top, and more hot sauce if desired. Enjoy!
