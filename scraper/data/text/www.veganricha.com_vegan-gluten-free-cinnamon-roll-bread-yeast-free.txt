Ingredients:
3/4 cup besan ((gram flour), will also work with chickpea flour, but will need more icing for added moisture)
2 tbsp cornstarch or potato starch
1.5 tbsp almond flour
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp cinnamon
3/4 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp citric acid (powder)
1/4 cup fine or powdered sugar (,1 tbsp more for sweeter)
1 tbsp lemon juice
1 tsp vinegar ((white or apple cider))
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 cup water
3 tbsp oil
1/4 cup  sugar ((I use a combination of coconut sugar and cane or powdered))
1.5 tsp cinnamon (, + a good pinch of nutmeg and cardamom if you wish)
2 tsp oil

Instructions:
Grease a deep casserole dish (I use 1.5 qt, 9.5 by 7.5 inch),and keep ready. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a bowl, whisk in all the dry ingredients to combine well.&nbsp;
In another bowl, mix the lemon, vinegar, vanilla and water and mix well. Add the mixture and oil to the dry bowl and whisk to combine really well. The batter will start to increase in volume with air and will become thick and fluffy. Set aside for 2 mins
In another bowl, mix the sugar and cinnamon for the filling and a good pinch of salt and set aside.
Drop the fluffy batter into the prepared dish. Sprinkle some of the sugar cinnamon mixture and swirl it around. Drop more of the batter and more of the sugar cinnamon mixture. Drizzle oil on top in the end.
Cover the casserole with a parchment and a baking sheet to seal. Bake for 14 to 15 minutes. Take the casserole out and let it sit covered with parchment for another 2 minutes.&nbsp;
Add a drizzle of melted vegan butter or icing and serve while hot. To store, cover and store on the counter for a few hours, those these are best fresh and warm.&nbsp;
