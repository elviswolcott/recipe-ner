Ingredients:
1 cup canned pumpkin
1/3 cup water
1/3 cup canola or melted coconut oil
2 tbs ground flaxseed
1 tsp vanilla
1/4 cup blackstrap molasses
1 cup sugar
1 2/3 cup spelt flour
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp nutmeg

Instructions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly grease mini muffin pan.
In a large bowl, whisk together canned pumpkin, water, canola or melted coconut oil, ground flaxseed, vanilla, molasses and sugar until well combined.
In a separate bowl, mix together the spelt flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg with a wooden spoon.
Add wet ingredients to the dry and stir with the wooden spoon until just combined. Do not over mix. The batter will be fairly thick.
Divide the batter into the mini muffin pan, filling them about 3/4 of the way full.
Bake for 18-20 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean. Let cool for 5-10 minutes, and then serve to your little ones! These also freeze well.
Variation: Add mini chocolate chips to the batter before baking.
