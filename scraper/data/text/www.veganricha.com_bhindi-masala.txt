Ingredients:
1 tsp oil
1/2 tsp mustard seeds
1/2 tsp cumin seeds
1/2  medium onion thinly sliced
1  green chili (finely chopped)
2-3 cloves of garlic (finely chopped)
1/2 inch ginger (finley chopped)
2.5 cups chopped Okra
1/4 tsp turmeric
3/4 tsp coriander powder
cayenne as needed
3/4 cup chopped tomatoes
2 tsp ketchup  (or use tomato paste)
1/4 cup water
1/2 tsp salt.
garam masala and cilantro for garnish.

Instructions:
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. when hot, add mustard and cumin seeds and cook until they start to pop or change color.
Add the onion, chili, garlic, ginger and cook until translucent. 4 mins. I usually use my mini food processor to chop these. Lots of onion garlic chili used in Indian food, so i know i will need more chopped for dals or curries.
Add okra and pinch of salt., Cook for 10 minutes or until golden on some edges. Stir occasionally. Roasting the okra till the edges dry out a bit will seal in the slime.
Add spices, tomato, ketchup, salt and water. Cover and cook until tomatoes are cooked. 6 mins Taste and adjust salt and spice. Mash the larger tomato pieces. Sprinkle some garam masala and mix in. Garnish with cilantro. Serve in a bowl with dals, soups or curries and cooked grains or flatbread.
