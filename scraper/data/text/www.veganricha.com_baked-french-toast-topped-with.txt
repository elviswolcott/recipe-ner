Ingredients:
3 Tablespoon coarsely ground Oats (not flour)
a pinch of baking powder
a pinch of salt
1/4-1/3 cup blueberries
1 Tablespoon Agave syrup
1 teaspoon maple syrup
1/2 teaspoon melted coconut oil
add 1 teaspoon ground raw sugar for a sweeter version
2-3 slices of whole grain bread cubed or slices to fit the ramekins
2 Tablespoons of vegan pancake mix (I use bob's red mill 7 grain)
1 teaspoon flaxmeal
1/4 cup coconut milk or almond milk (I use So Delicious vanilla coconut milk or plain almond plus)
2 Tablespoons water
a generous pinch of spices of choice or vanilla extract
1 Tablespoons Agave or maple

Instructions:
For French Toasts: Mix everything except bread slices to make a not too thin batter.((Or use the gf batter with Oats, flax and non dairy milk like the Tiramisu or Samoa French Toasts.)
Dip Slices in the batter and place in greased ramekin/baking dish. You can cube the slices, or use size according to the ramekin and stack them 2-3 deep or layer like bread pudding.
