Ingredients:
2  ripe medium Bananas
1 Tbsp oil (optional)
1/4 cup non dairy milk
2-3 Tbsp maple syrup  (depends on the ripeness of the banana)
1/8 tsp salt
1/2 tsp vinegar
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 cup Oat flour (certified gluten-free)
1/4 cup almond flour
1/4 cup white rice flour
1/4 cup amaranth flour (or sorghum or millet or use half flour and half starch for lighter loaf.)
1 Tbsp cornstarch  (or arrowroot starch)
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp cloves
1/4 tsp ginger
1/3 cup chopped walnuts

Instructions:
Pre-heat the oven to 365 degrees F / 180Âºc.
Mash the bananas well. then mix in all the wet ingredients.
In a bowl, mix all the dry ingredients. Add to the wet and mix to combine.
Fold in the walnuts. Drop the batter in a greased pan.
Even it out and bake for 40 minutes.Check with a toothpick from the center. it should come out almost clean. Bake longer if needed.
I used very ripe bananas. Use stevia/sugar to preference if the bananas are not sweet enough for the loaf. Or if the loaf is already baked and not sweet enough, serve warm with light maple drizzle.
