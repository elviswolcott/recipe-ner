Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups non dairy milk such as unsweetened plain almond milk (2 cups for more sauce)
1 tbsp flour (unbleached white or rice flour)
2 tbsp cashews  (or use 2 tbsp flour)
3 cloves of garlic  (or 3/4 tsp garlic powder)
1 inch ginger
1/2 tsp onion powder
1/2  hot green chile (or use cayenne to preference)
1 tsp garam masala (or 1/2 tsp ground cumin and ground coriander, a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg)
1/4 tsp each of ground cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, ground mustard and cayenne
3/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp sugar or maple (omit if using sweetened milk or coconut milk)
2 tsp oil (optional)
1 1/2 cup baby greens
2 cups veggies ( such as cauliflower, green beans, carrot, peas, zucchini, broccoli)
salt and black pepper
biscuit dough (or vegan Puff pastry)

Instructions:
Pre-heat the oven to 425 degrees F / 220Âºc.
In a blender, add all the ingredients under masala sauce. Blend well. Taste and adjust salt and spice if needed. Do not add too much as the spices and flavors get stronger while baking.
In a baking dish, pour half of the sauce. Spread the greens over the sauce. then spread the veggies to distribute evenly. Sprinkle salt and black pepper liberally over the veggies. Drizzle the remaining sauce over the veggies.
Cover the dish loosely with parchment paper or foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil or parchment carefully.
If using puff pastry place the puff pastry cut outs * on a sheet beside the casserole and bake for 10 to 12 minutes. When done, place the puffed pastry on top and serve. Alternatively, place the entire puff pastry sheet on the casserole. Use a fork or kitchen shears to make holes in the sheet. Put dish back in the oven, Bake for 17 to 19 minutes until golden. (* I use a cookie cutter to cut out 2.5 inch rounds of puff pastry)
If using biscuit dough, place the dough in the casserole over the veggies. Put the dish back in the oven for 18 minutes or until golden.
Cool for a few minutes, add a dash of cayenne and serve.
