Ingredients:
(1) 12-ounce package jumbo shells
(1) 26-ounce jar marinara sauce (about 3 cups)
2 cups raw cashews
(1) 14-ounce firm tofu (drained from package)
1/2 cup nutritional yeast
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice (about 1 large lemon)
1/4 cup water
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons dried basil
2  teaspoons dried oregano
1 teaspoon garlic powder
(1) 10-ounce package chopped frozen spinach, thawed (or 2-3 cups fresh)

Instructions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.&nbsp;
Boil the Shells: Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add the jumbo shells. Cook for 8-10 minutes, until done. Drain and rinse with cold water. Set aside. Some will likely break, but you will only need about 3/4 of the package so that is okay.
Make the Spinach Ricotta: Add the cashews to a food processor, and process until fine and crumbly. Now add the rest of the ricotta ingredients EXCEPT the spinach. Process until smooth and creamy, scraping the sides as needed. Now add the spinach, squeezing out excess water before adding. Pulse to combine.
In a large casserole dish, evenly spread about 1 cup of the marinara sauce in the bottom.
Stuff the Shells: Scoop about 2 tablespoons of the spinach ricotta into each shell and place open side up into the baking dish. Repeat until all the filling is used up. I love using a piping bag and large tip for this, it makes filling a breeze!
Spoon remaining marinara sauce on top of the stuffed shells, and place in the oven. Cook, uncovered, for 25 minutes.Â Serve immediately and enjoy!
