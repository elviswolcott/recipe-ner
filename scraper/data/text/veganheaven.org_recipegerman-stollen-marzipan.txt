Ingredients:
4 1/2  cups all-purpose flour
one packet  instant yeast
3/4 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup + 2 tablespoons vegan margarine
1/4 cup soy milk ((it should have room temperature))
2 tablespoons brown rum
1 pinch cardamom
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon allspice
1/3 cup ground almonds
2/3 cup raisins
1/3 cup candied lemon, chopped
1/3 cup candied orange, chopped
6  dried apricots, chopped
3.5 oz marzipan
1/4 cup margarine
powdered sugar, to sprinkle

Instructions:
In a small pot, melt the margarine over low heat and let it cool down for a bit.
In the meantime, combine the flour, the dry yeast, the sugar, the milk, the rum, the ground almonds, and the spices in a mixing bowl. Add the melted margarine and knead all ingredients into a dough. Form a ball, cover it with plastic wrap, and let it rise at a warm place for about 2 hours.
When the dough is ready, gently gold in the dried apricots, the raisins and the candied lemon and oranges.
Form the marzipan into a longish role. Roll the dough into a 9 by 13-inch rectangle. Place the marzipan in the middle of the rectangle and fold one side of the stollen over the marzipan.
Preheat the oven to 350Â°F and bake for 45 minutes. Cover with aluminium foil if necessary (if it gets too brown).
When the stollen is ready, melt the remaining margarine. Immediately coat the stollen with the melted margarine and sprinkle with powdered sugar.
The stollen is best when you prepare it in advance and let it sit for at least 2 weeks (it should be wrapped and stored at a cool place).
