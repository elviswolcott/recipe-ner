Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups raw cashews
3 tablespoons lemon juice (| about 1 large lemon juiced)
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup water

Instructions:
Soak the raw cashew pieces in hot water for 5-10 minutes. I heat up water in my electric kettle and pour it over the cashews to soak.
Drain the cashews, discard the water and add them to a high powered blender. Now add the lemon juice, apple cider vinegar, salt and 3/4 cup fresh water. Blend until very smooth.
Store in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. It will thicken as it cools, making it better for spreading on sandwiches.&nbsp;
