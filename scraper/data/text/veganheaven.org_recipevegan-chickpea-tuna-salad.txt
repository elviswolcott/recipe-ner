1/2 cup unsweetened soymilk
1 teaspoon white wine vinegar
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon mustard
1/2 cup canola oil

Instructions:
Make the mayonnaise: In a blender, combine all ingredients except the oil and the guar gum and let it sit for 1-2 minutes. Then blend on high until smooth. Add the guar gum and slowly stream in the oil. Blend until the mixture slowly thickens.
Soak the shredded dried seaweed in water for about 5 minutes. Then finely chop it.
Mash the chickpeas with a fork until they have a flaky texture.  Stir in the celery, mayonnaise, dill, seaweed, and onions and season with soy sauce, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper.
Serve on whole wheat toast with tomato, cucumber, and lettuce or eat by itself.
