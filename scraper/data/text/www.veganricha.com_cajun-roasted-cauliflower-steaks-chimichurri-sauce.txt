Ingredients:
1  small head of cauliflower (, sliced into 1/2 inch thick slices or chopped into medium size florets)
2 tbsp cajun spice blend
1/2 to 3/4 tsp salt (, if using store bought cajun blend, it might already be salted, so you will need 1/4 tsp)
2 tsp oil
1 tsp lemon juice
1  cup  packed parsley  (or one bunch parsley leaves and tender stems, chopped)
1/4  cup  basil packed (or use cilantro)
6  cloves  of raw garlic  (more the merrier)
2  tbsp  extra virgin olive oil
juice of 1 lime
1  tsp  vinegar apple cider or balsamic or red wine vinegar
1/4  tsp  salt
1/4  tsp  black pepper
2  tbsp  or more avocado for creamyness optional

Instructions:
Slice the cauliflower or chop into florets. Blend the chimichurri sauce with a few tbsp of water and set aside. Line a baking dish with parchment. Preheat the oven to 425 deg F ( 220 C )
Rub oil and lemon juice all over the slices or florets.
Sprinkle the cajun spice + salt on both sides of the slices and rub lightly. Then sprinkle more on the open side. (If using florets, sprinkle spice + salt, then toss well to coat).&nbsp;For Crispyness, mix 2 tbsp breadcrumbs in the spice mix and salt and then sprinkle all over.
Spray oil lightly on the spiced cauliflower to seal the spices in, Bake at 425 deg F for 20 to 25 mins. Broil for a minute to sear if needed.
Cauliflower tends to soften depending on the moisture content after cooking. So serve immediately. Sprinkle some more spice if needed. Cajun can be hot, so add another cooling dressing of choice if needed.Serve with a side salad of beans, chickpeas, or cooked grain or add to tacos, wraps. I make a salad bowl with cherry tomatoes/tomatoes, onion, chickpeas/beans, salt, pepper and chimichurri/lemon with these.
