Ingredients:
1 tablespoon ground flax seeds
2 tablespoons water
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup coconut sugar or brown sugar
1/2 cup cocoa powder
2 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 cup almond milk
2 tablespoons coconut oil, melted
3/4 cup grated zucchini
1/2 cup vegan chocolate chips
3 tablespoons peanut butter
1/4 cup peanuts, roughly chopped

Instructions:
Combine the ground flax seeds with water. Stir well and let it sit for about 3-5 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine the rest of the ingredients (except for the peanut butter and the peanuts) in a medium bowl. Stir gently with a wooden spoon until well combined.
Place baking cups in a muffin pan and divide the mixture evenly. Stir in some peanut butter and top each muffin with some peanuts.
Bake for about 15 minutes at 360F (180C). Let cool down in the muffin tin for at least half an hour.
