Ingredients:
1/4 cup tomato paste
1  medium tomato
1 1/2 cups water (or vegetable broth)
1  chipotle chili in adobo sauce  (or 1/4 tsp of chipotle chili powder)
1/2 tsp ground cumin
1/4 tsp salt
2 tsp  oil
1/2 cup thinly sliced onions
1/2 cup thinly sliced green bell pepper
2 oz  soy curls  (soaked in 1 1/2 cups of warm vegetable broth for at least 15 minutes)
2 cloves  garlic (minced)
1 tsp chili powder blend
1/4 tsp salt
1/4  black pepper
1 1/2 cups or more tortilla chips (or use sliced tortillas )
15 oz can of black beans (drained)
Vegan Cheddar Cheese Shreds of choice (or use my queso (linked in notes))

Instructions:
Blend all the ingredients in the red sauce and set aside.
Heat a cast iron skillet over medium high heat. Add the oil, and when the oil is hot, add in the onion and bell pepper, mix well. Cook until translucent.
Drain your soy curls, and squeeze lightly to remove excess moisture, then chop up some of the larger pieces, then add the soy curls to the skillet as well.
Cook this mixture until the onion is golden brown, and the soy curls are starting to turn brown on some of the edges. Add in the garlic and mix well, add in the chili powder, salt, and pepper and mix well, then add in your chipotle pepper, 2 tsps of the adobo sauce, mix well, then add in 3-4 tbsp of the red sauce and mix.
Take off heat, then layer this mixture with the tortilla chips, black beans, and the remaining red sauce all over the beans and the tortilla chips.
Then distribute the vegan cheddar shreds or vegan queso. Drizzle it all over.
Move the skillet to an oven, and broil for 4-6 minutes, or until the cheese is melted, and the mixutre is bubbly, and the top is starting to get golden brown. Remove the skillet, garnish with cilantro, and green onions, and serve it with chili. You can serve this with avocado, vegan sour cream, and any other toppings of choice. No oven: Alternatively , cover the skillet and cook over medium heat until the cheese on top is bubbly
