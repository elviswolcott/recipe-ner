Ingredients:
1  onion
2 large carrots
4 stalks of celery
4 tablespoons nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon dried majoram
2  bay leaves
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
2 cups cooked chickpeas ((canned or cooked from dried chickpeas))
1/2 teaspoon miso paste
7 cups vegetable broth or vegan chicken broth
1 cup rotini pasta ((use brown rice pasta for a gluten-free version))
fresh parsley, chopped
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste

Instructions:
Finely chop the onion. Peel and slice the carrots as well as the celery.
Heat some oil in a large pot and saut√© the onions for about 2-3 minutes on medium heat until they become translucent. Then add the carrots and the celery and cook for another 4 minutes. Then stir in the marjoram, the oregano, the thyme, the bay leaves, and the nutritional yeast and cook until fragrant (about 30-60 seconds).
Add the vegetable broth, the miso paste, and the chickpeas and bring to a boil. Cook for 10 minutes.
After 10 minutes of cooking time, add the pasta. Cook for another 7-10 minutes depending on the pasta you use. Discard the bay leaves.&nbsp;
Serve immediately and sprinkle the soup with freshly chopped parsley. It's great with crispy rustic bread!
