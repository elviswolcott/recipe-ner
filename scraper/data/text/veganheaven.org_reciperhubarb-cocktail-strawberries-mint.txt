Ingredients:
2 cups rhubarb, peeled and chopped
about 10  strawberries
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed orange juice
2 1/2 cups sparkling wine
1/2 cup fresh mint leaves
1/2  orange, sliced

Instructions:
In a small pot, cook the rhubarb with the brown sugar, the water, and about half of the strawberries for about 3-5 minutes on high heat. After cooking, add the orange juice and either use an immersion blender or transfer it to your blender to puree it. Let it cool down for a bit.
Add 3 tablespoons of the rhubarb puree to each glass and evenly divide the sparkling wine.
Serve the rhubarb cocktail with fresh strawberries, orange slices, mint leaves, and ice cubes. Enjoy!
