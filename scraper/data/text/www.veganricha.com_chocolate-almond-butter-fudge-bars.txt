Ingredients:
8 to 10 oz coconut butter  (or 1 loaded cup)
1/2 cup creamy almond butter (or use other smooth nut or seed butter **)
3 tbsp maple syrup (or more)
1/8 tsp salt
a good pinch of cinnamon
1.5 oz dark chocolate 1/2 theo dark chocolate bar

Instructions:
Melt the coconut butter over gentle heat (low medium) until completely melted. Stir occasionally. 2 to 4 mins
Add the nut butter, maple, salt, cinnamon and mix well until smooth. Carefully taste the mixture and adjust sweet is needed.
Pour 2/3 of the mixture in parchment lined pan. (You can refrigerate this layer for 15 mins or more if it is too liquidy to set before adding chocolate layer. The layer might be liquidy with coconut oil and somewhere between liquidy and nut butter consistency depending on the coconut butter).
Add chocolate to the remaining nut butter mixture and continue to heat for another 30 seconds. Then take off heat. Mix well until the chocolate melts and combines. (You can also use cocoa powder instead and mix into the nut butter mixture)
Drop over the nut butter layer in the loaf pan and spread evenly.
Chill for atleast an hour. Slice and serve! Store on a cool counter for a few days or refrigerated for weeks.
