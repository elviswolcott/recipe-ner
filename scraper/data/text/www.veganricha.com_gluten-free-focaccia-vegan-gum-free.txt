Ingredients:
1/2 cup superfine almond flour
1/2 cup oat flour
1/3 cup potato starch
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon Italian herb blend
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
2 tablespoons oil
1/4 cup + 1 tablespoon warm non-dairy milk (such as almond or oat )
1/2 teaspoon active yeast
1/4 cup neutral-flavored preferably unsweetened club soda
1-2 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary or 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary (or you can also use thyme)
1 clove of garlic minced

Instructions:
Make the bread batter: To a bowl, add all the dry ingredients and mix well. That is the almond flour, oat flour, potato starch, salt, baking powder, herbs, and garlic powder, and mix really well. Press and mix to break the almond flour lumps. You can also add the ingredients through a sifter. This is especially helpful for gf baking
Add in tbe oil. Add in the warm non-dairy milk and yeast and mix in. Add in 2 tablespoons of the club soda and mix in as well. Let this batter sit for 25-30 minutes in a warm place, covered.
After 30 minutes, add in the remaining 2 tablespoons of club soda by gently mixing it in. Use super fresh club soda so that there's a lot of aeration in it.
Line a 9 by 5 inch loaf pan with parchment. Then transfer this batter to the pan and even it out on top.
Mix the rosemary and garlic in olive oil then drizzle all over.. Let the pan sit in a warm place for another 15 minutes while you preheat the oven. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F(180c)
Then cover the pan lightly with another parchment and put it in the oven for baking. Bake for 28-30 minutes.
Then remove from the oven. Let the bread sit for another 5 minutes before removing it from the pan to cool some more. serve it with some vegan butter.
This bread is best on the day it is baked. You can refrigerate it for up to 4 days but the texture gets slightly dense after a day or so.
