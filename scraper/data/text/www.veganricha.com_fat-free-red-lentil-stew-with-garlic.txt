Ingredients:
1/2 cup pink lentils (split red lentils, Masoor dal Washed and soaked for 1/2 an hour.)
1.5 cups water
1/3 teaspoon salt or to taste
1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds
1/4 teaspoon cumin seeds
4-5  curry leaves chopped
2  Shallots finely chopped
2-3 cloves of garlic chopped
1/2  green chili pepper or chili flakes to taste
1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder
a generous pinch of asafoetida (Hing)
1/2 teaspoon coriander powder

Instructions:
Heat a large pan on medium heat.
Add the mustard and cumin seeds and stir once. Let them start to pop a little.
Add the curry leaves, green chili, shallots and garlic and cook stirring every few seconds until golden. (add a few drops of water if needed)
Add in the hing, turmeric and coriander powders. Mix well for a few seconds.
(you can add some chopped tomato as well. Add 1 medium tomato, mix well and cook for 2-3 minutes until soft and then add the lentils).
Drain the lentils and add to pan. Add salt and water. Mix well.
Cover and cook on low heat for 15-20 minutes.
Stir, taste and adjust salt and spice, add water if the daal is too thick.
Cook partially covered, for another 10 minutes or so until required consistency is achieved(I stop at about the 10 minute mark when the lentils are soft, and not too mushy. Cook longer for a really soupy consistency).
Garnish with chopped green onion or cilantro and dash of lemon juice.
Serve hot with Rice, or dry veggie subzi and Flat breads.
