Ingredients:
6 to 8 oz fusilli or fettucini.
1 tsp oil
1/2 cup chopped onion or shallots
3  fat cloves of garlic
1/4 cup raw pumpkin seeds
1/2 cup water (divided)
3 tbsp nutritional yeast
1/4 tsp or more dried thyme
1/4 tsp dried basil or oregano
3/4 tsp or more salt
1.5 to 2 tsp fresh lemon juice
1/2 tsp white vinegar
1 tbsp flour (I use whole wheat. use rice flour to make gf)
a generous dash of black pepper
2 tsp extra virgin olive oil
1 cup unsweetened non dairy milk
1 cup baby spinach  (optional)
1/2 cup thawed peas (optional)
red pepper flakes
black pepper
vegan peptita parm

Instructions:
Cook pasta according to instructions and keep aside.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onions and garlic and cook until translucent. 3 to 4 minutes.
Add pumpkin seeds and 1/4 cup water an bring to a boil. about 4 minutes. Cook for 2 more minutes, then let it cool a bit..
Meanwhile add all the ingredients from nutritional yeast through non dairy milk to the blender (nutritional yeast, herbs, salt, lemon, vinegar, flour, pepper, olive oil, non dairy milk). Add the onion pumpkin seed mixture to the blender. Blend until smooth.
Return to the skillet over medium heat. Add another 1/4 cup water.(I use the water to rinse the blender and added it to the skillet). Bring to a boil. Stir frequently to avoid lumps. The mixture will thicken considerably. Cook for another minute, so the flour is cooked through. Total 3 to 4 minutes. Carefully taste and adjust the salt and tang. Add more herbs if you wish.
Add the cooked pasta, spinach, peas and other veggies if using. Toss well. If the sauce is too thick, add a few tbsp of water or the pasta cooking water and mix in. Cover and switch off heat. Let the pasta sit for 2-3 minutes before serving.
Garnish with pepper flakes and nutritional yeast or vegan parmesan of choice.
