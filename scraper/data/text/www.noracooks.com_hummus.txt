Ingredients:
15 ounce can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
4 tablespoons tahini
1 clove garlic, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2-1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
4-6 tablespoons cold water
sprinkle of paprika or sumac
chopped fresh parsley, cilantro or dill
drizzle of olive oil
pine nuts
hot sauce

Instructions:
To a food processor, add the drained and rinsed chickpeas, tahini, garlic, cumin, salt, lemon juice and 4 tablespoons of cold water.
Puree for about 4-5 minutes until smooth and creamy. If it&#039;s not quite creamy or too thick, add a few more tablespoons of cold water. This will help fluff it up and make it creamy and smooth.
Taste and season with additional salt, garlic, cumin or lemon juice if needed.
Add to a bowl and garnish with toppings of choice. Serve with pita bread and veggie sticks or spread on toast, sandwiches, mix into pasta or use anywhere else you like. Enjoy!
