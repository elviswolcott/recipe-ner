Ingredients:
2 tsp oil (divided)
1/2 recipe chickpea flour tofu ((1.25 cups cubed, or use firm tofu if using soy))
1.5 cups veggies such as pepper (carrots, green beans, zucchini)
6 to 8 oz noodles or rice to serve
4 tbsp sunbutter ((sunflower seed butter), or use oeanut, almond or cashew butter for nut sauce.)
1/2 tsp salt
2 tsp sriracha
2 tsp maple syrup or sugar
1.5 tbsp lemon juice
1 tsp rice vinegar (, optional)
2 cloves of garlic or 1/2 tsp garlic powder
1 tbsp ginger (, chopped fresh ginger)
1 tsp sesame oil
1/2 cup coconut milk (+ 1/2 cup water to rinse(used later))

Instructions:
Prepare your chickpea tofu if you havent already and chill for 15 mins then cube. Blend sunbutter sauce with 1/2 cup coconut milk and set aside.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. When it has heated, add cubed chickpea tofu and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. (You can toss the chickpea tofu in 1 tbsp cornstarch before roasting to make it crispier). Remove from the skillet. This helps the chickpea tofu hold shape and not get sticky in hot sauces.&nbsp;
Add veggies and a teaspoon of oil and cook for another 3 to 5 minutes. Add a generous dash of black pepper and mix in. Then add the chickpea tofu.
Add the blended sunbutter sauce then use 1/2 cup of water to rinse out the blender and add the water to the skillet. Mix and cook for 5 minutes. Adjust salt and heat to taste. Add more water or coconut milk if it's thickening too quickly or for thinner consistency.(sauce thickens on cooling)&nbsp;
Serve over noodles or rice, lettuce, with lemon/lime juice, sriracha or pepper flakes and cilantro.&nbsp;
