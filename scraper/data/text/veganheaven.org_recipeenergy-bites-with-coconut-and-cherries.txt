Ingredients:
1 cup almonds
1/2 cup cashews
1 tablespoon chia seeds
3/4 cup dried cherries
8  dates
1/2 cup rolled oats
2 tablespoons coconut flakes
more coconut flakes, to roll in

Instructions:
Put all ingredients into a high speed blender or food processor and pulse until all ingredients are well combined. Usually you have to pulse about 6-8 times. You should get a very sticky mixture, which can easily be formed into little balls.
Form the mixture into 18-20 energy balls. Put some coconut flakes on a plate and roll the energy bites in them. The energy balls can be stored in an air-tight container in the fridge for up to one week. Enjoy!
