Ingredients:
7 oz firm tofu
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
3  cloves of garlic, minced
3 tablespoons tomato paste
3/4 cup dry red wine (use a vegan brand)
2 14.5 oz cans diced tomatoes
2 teaspoons dried oregano
1 tablespoon dried basil
2 cups passata
1/2 teaspoon soy sauce
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste
4.5 oz mushrooms, cut into small cubes
1  small zucchini, cut into small cubes
1  carrot, cut into small cubes
9  lasagna sheets
3/4 cup vegan sour cream or vegan cream cheese
1 cup vegan cheese

Instructions:
Start by crumbling the tofu with your hands. In a large pan, heat the olive oil and pan-fry the crumbled tofu for about 3 minutes. Then add the chopped onion and cook for another 4 minutes. Then add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. 
While you make the Bolognese Sauce, pan-fry the vegetables in a second pan. Heat some oil and cook them for about 6 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Go back to the bolognese sauce: after one minute, add the tomato paste and cook for 2 more minutes. 
Deglaze with red wine and cook for 3 minutes. Then add the diced tomatoes as well as the pureed tomatoes and season with oregano, basil, salt, and pepper.
While you make the tofu bolognese sauce, pan-fry the vegetables in a second pan. Heat some oil and cook them for about 6 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Once the bolognese sauce is ready, add the veggies and stir well.
Add a cup of the bolognese sauce at the bottom of your casserole dish. Then add a layer of lasagna sheets, then again Bolognese sauce, and top it with some vegan sour cream or vegan cream cheese. Continue with two more layers of sauce and lasagna sheets. Put the rest of the bolognese sauce on top and sprinkle with vegan cheese.
Preheat your oven to 350 °F and bake the lasagna for 30-35 minutes, depending on your oven.
