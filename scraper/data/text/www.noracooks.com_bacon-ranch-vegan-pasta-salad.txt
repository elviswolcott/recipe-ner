Ingredients:
16 ounce box rotini pasta
1 large tomato, diced (about 1 cup)
4 ounce can sliced black olives
1 cup shredded carrots
1 recipe Cashew Ranch (leave out dill if desired)
8 ounce package tempeh
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
1 tablespoon pure maple syrup
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
2 teaspoons liquid smoke

Instructions:
Get the tempeh marinating: In a medium bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, apple cider vinegar, maple syrup, cumin and liquid smoke. Crumble in the tempeh with your fingers, cover and place in the refrigerator to marinate for 10 minutes to 2 hours, or overnight.&nbsp;
Make the Cashew Ranch. May leave out the fresh dill if desired.&nbsp;
Boil the noodles according to package instructions. Drain and rinse with cold water, and stir so they don't stick together. Set aside to cool while you make the tempeh bacon.
Cook the tempeh bacon crumbles: In a small pan, add a tablespoon of olive oil (or not for oil-free). Drain the excess marinade liquid, and over medium heat saute the tempeh crumbles for about 10 minutes, stirring frequently, until they are golden brown. Remove from heat.
In a large bowl, stir together the pasta and ranch dressing. Now, toss with the tempeh crumbles, tomatoes, olives and carrots.
Serve immediately or store in a covered container until ready to serve. The pasta may suck up some of the dressing over time, simply add a little water and stir if that happens.
