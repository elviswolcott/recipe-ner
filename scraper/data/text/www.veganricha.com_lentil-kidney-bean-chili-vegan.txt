Ingredients:
1/2 cup dry Lentils (brown lentils or 1 cup cooked)
1 cup Kidney beans (cooked or canned)
2 tsp oil
1/2  red onion (chopped)
1  green chili (chopped (Serrano or Bird's eye or Jalapeno, to taste))
2 to 3 cloves of garlic chopped
2  medium tomatoes (chopped)
1/2 tsp chipotle pepper powder
2 to 3 tsp taco spice blend (recipe below)
1/2  red bell pepper (chopped)
1/4 cup chopped celery
2 cups water (less or more to consistency preferred , use 1.5 cups if using cooked lentils)
3/4 tsp salt or to taste
1/2 cup fresh or frozen corn
Pickled jalapeno (cilantro, lemon juice, sour cream/yogurt, guacamole, tortilla strips for garnish.)

Instructions:
Soak the lentils in hot water for half an hour. Drain and keep ready.
In a large pan, add oil, and heat on medium. Add the onion and cook until translucent. 4 minutes.
Add in the green chili pepper and garlic and cook for 2 minutes.
Add the tomatoes, chipotle pepper, taco spice and cook until tomatoes are saucy. 5 minutes.
Add the bell pepper, celery, mix and cook for a minute.
Add the drained lentils and kidney beans, salt and water and mix well. Cover and cook for 20 minutes.
Stir, taste and adjust salt and spice, and water if needed. Reduce heat to low-medium and cover and cook for another 20 minutes or until the lentils and kidney beans are very tender. (If using cooked lentils, simmer for 5 minutes.)
Cook uncovered to thicken the chili or add water if too thick.
Mix in the corn and 1/2 tsp lemon juice. Sprinkle a bit more taco spice blend if you like. I did.
Serve hot, topped with some of vegan sour cream, cashew cream or yogurt, pickled jalapenos, chopped onion, a bunch of cilantro, non dairy cheddar, salsa, sliced avocado and anything and everything. To make this Indian, add garam masala instead of taco spice.
