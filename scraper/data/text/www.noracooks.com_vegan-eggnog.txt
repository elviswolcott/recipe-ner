Ingredients:
1 cup raw cashews (see notes for alternatives)
3 cups non-dairy milk
1/4-1/2 cup granulated sugar or pure maple syrup
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon cloves
1 ounce whiskey or rum, per serving, optional

Instructions:
Bring 3 cups of water to a boil. Pour the hot water over the cashews and let soak for 5 minutes.
Drain the cashews and discard the soaking water. Add them to a blender along with the non-dairy milk, sugar (you can start with the 1/4 cup), vanilla, nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves and blend until very smooth. Taste, add more sweetener or spices if needed.Â 
Let it chill in the refrigerator for at least an hour before serving, it will thicken up and give the flavors time to mingle. Serve alcohol free or add 1 ounce of whiskey/rum to each glass, as desired. I also topped mine with a little coconut whipped cream and a sprinkle of nutmeg.
