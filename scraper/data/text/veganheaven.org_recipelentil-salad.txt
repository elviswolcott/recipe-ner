Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups brown or green lentils
1  English cucumber
1/2 cup fresh parsley
1/2 cup fresh mint
3  tomatoes
1  yellow bell pepper
1  small red onion
3 tablespoons olive oil
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1  clove of garlic, minced
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste

Instructions:
Cook the lentils according to the instructions on the package. Don&#039;t cook them for too long. They should be just tender. I like to cook dried lentils in my Instant Pot. I usually cook them for 9 minutes. 
Cut the cucumber, the tomatoes, and the bell pepper into medium-sized pieces. Finely dice the red onion. 
Finely chop the parsley and the mint. 
Juice the lemon. 
Make the dressing: Place all ingredients for the dressing in a small bowl and stir well.  Then place everything in a large bowl and toss until evenly combined.
