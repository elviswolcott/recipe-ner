Ingredients:
2 tablets (tablillas) Hernan Mexican chocolate
2 cups Almond-coconut milk (unsweetened)
1  Avocado ripe, (cut in half, flesh removed)
¼ cup Maple syrup

Instructions:
Bring the coconut-almond milk to a very low simmer over low heat. Add chocolate tablets, and stir with a whisk or molinillo.
Once the chocolate has dissolved pour it in a container and let it cool completely in the fridge or freezer.
Place the chocolate mixture, avocado, and maple syrup in the blender, and puree until smooth.
Pour into ice trays and freeze overnight.
The following day unmold the cubes and place in the food processor. Process until smooth (hold on to your food processor because it’s going to shake!)
Eat right away and enjoy!!
