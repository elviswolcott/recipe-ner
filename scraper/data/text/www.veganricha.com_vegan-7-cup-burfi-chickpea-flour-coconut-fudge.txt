Ingredients:
1/2 cup chickpea flour (garbanzo bean flour) or besan (brown chickpea flour)
1.5 tbsp vegan butter or oil
1/2 cup coconut shreds (small shreds)
3/4 cup raw unrefined sugar
a good pinch of salt
1/2 cup almond milk (, or use soy milk for nutfree)
1/2 tsp cardamom powder
1 to 2 tbsp  vegan butter or oil

Instructions:
Line a loaf pan with parchment or grease and set aside. Add the chickpea flour and vegan butter or oil to a skillet over medium heat. Roast for 3 to 5 minutes. Stir occasionally.&nbsp;
Add sugar,salt and coconut and mix in for a few seconds. Add almond milk and mix in. Bring to a boil and continue to cook for 3 minutes. Stir occasionally.
Add 1 tbsp vegan butter or oil and mix in. Continue to cook until the mixture starts to leave the edges and gets porous and bubble. This will take anywhere from 12 to 18 minutes. If using oil, add another good pinch of salt and mix in. At the 7 minute mark, you can add i n another tbsp of oil. (The cooking time can be more depending on the stove, pan, moisture content of the sugar etc. Check the mixture by taking a little bit in a spoon, cool for 10-15 seconds and check the consistency. It should be a somewhere between slightly chewy and fudge like. Too chewy means it needs more cooking time). &nbsp;&nbsp;
Fold in cardamom. Pour in a parchment lined or greased pan or just a large parchment paper. Even it out. Let it cool for 10 minutes, then slice. Cool for another 15 minutes before serving.&nbsp;The burfi keeps setting as it cools, so even if some of the edges are chewy rather than shortbread like, they will set to that texture after an hour or so.
Store in a container on the counter once completely cool.
