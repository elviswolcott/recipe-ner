Ingredients:
2 tablespoons Organic Canola Oil
2 teaspoons Coriander seeds
1/2 teaspoon Caraway seeds ((shahi jeera))
2-3  Cloves
3-4  Black peppercorns ((less or more depending on required spice))
2  Green cardamoms
2  Black cardamoms
2  Bay leaves
2  Whole dry red chillies ((less or more according to spice))
1 teaspoon Poppy seeds ((khuskhus/posto))
1  stone flower ((Dagadphool, I didn't have this))
1/4 teaspoon hing ((asofetida))
1 inch stick cinnamon
1  medium onion chopped
2 tablespoons cilantro leaves
1 tablespoon Dry coconut (khopra Or Jowar flour(Sorghum))
1 inch ginger chopped
1 cup chopped organic Tempeh ((can use Tofu or Seitan as well))
1 teaspoon vegan butter
1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste
1/2 teaspoon sugar

Instructions:
In a pan on medium heat, dry roast all the items under spices, continuously stirring) until they start turning slightly brown. (3-4 minutes).
Cool grind and keep if using for later.
In the same pan, add in the oil and cook the onions until golden. Add in the coconut and ginger and cook for another minute.
Blend the onion mixture with the spices and cilantro using a little water into a smooth paste. My blender conked out so the curry is not as smooth. In any which way, the curry is going to blow your mind away!
In the pan, add butter and the blended mixture, a cup of water, salt and sugar to taste. Adjust spice if needed( more black pepper for added authentic saoji taste)
Add in the Tempeh and cook on low heat covered for 20-30 minutes until the curry thickens and the tempeh is cooked and double in size.
Serve hot topped with any Indian flat bread(Roti, Paratha, Naan) or with Basmati Rice!.
Keep a pitcher of cold water at hand for the spice shock!!
