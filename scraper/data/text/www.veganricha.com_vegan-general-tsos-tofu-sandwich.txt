Greens

Instructions:
Press the tofu in a tofu press or in paper towels for atleast 10 mins. Slice and place in baking dish in one layer.
Mix all ingredients for the sauce. mix well. I use a small blender to blend everything except garlic, then mix in minced garlic. If not using veggie broth, add a generous pinch of salt to the sauce.
Pour in the baking dish and let sit to marinate for 15 mins or overnight for make ahead.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F / 200c. Bake for 25 mins or until the sauce thickens.
Prep the sandwich ingredients. Toast the bread or burger buns on a skillet over medium heat. Layer Greens, blanched broccoli slices or broccoli slaw. Thinly slice the broccoli if needed. Place the tofu slices. Pour some of the extra sauce over the tofu, sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds (optional) and serve immediately.
Other additions to the sandwich instead of broccoli can be thinly sliced crunchy veggies like cucumber, carrots or cabbage,some cilantro, sliced jalapeno.
