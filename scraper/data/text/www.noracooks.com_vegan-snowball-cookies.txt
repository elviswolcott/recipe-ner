Ingredients:
1 cup vegan butter, softened
1/2 cup powdered sugar
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
2 cups all purpose flour
3/4 cup finely chopped pecans
1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, for rolling

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
With a hand mixer, cream together the vegan butter and 1/2 cup powdered sugar. Beat in vanilla, then add the flour and pecans and beat on low speed until combined.Â 
Using a tablespoon or small cookie scoop, scoop out the cooke dough and roll into balls. Place the balls on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 14-16 minutes or until the cookies are set and the bottoms are slightly brown.
Let the cookies cool for 10 minutes. Place the 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar in a bowl. Roll the cookies in the powdered sugar, then place on a cooling rack, or back on the baking sheet.
Once completely cooled, roll once more in powdered sugar. Store in a covered container for up to 5 days.
