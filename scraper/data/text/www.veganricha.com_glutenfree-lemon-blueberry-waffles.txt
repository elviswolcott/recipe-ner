Ingredients:
1/2 cup almond flour
1/2 cup oat flour
1/4 cup potato starch
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon oil
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1/4 cup plus 1-2 tablespoons of club soda
1/3 cup blueberries

Instructions:
In a bowl, mix all the dry ingredients - oat flour, almond flour, potato starch, baking powder, salt, and sugar - and mix really well.
Then add in the lemon juice, oil, lemon zest. Add in a 1/4 cup of the club soda and mix in. Add in more, 1 tablespoon at a time.
Let the mixture sit for 2 minutes. It will start to thicken out and you can add more soda accordingly so that you have a pancake-like batter.
Don't add any more club soda for 5 minutes because the batter does thicken a bit more because oat flour will thicken it up. But you don't want too much moisture.
Fold in the blueberries. Prepare your waffle iron by brushing a little bit of oil on it.
Once heated, add the batter and make your waffles.
