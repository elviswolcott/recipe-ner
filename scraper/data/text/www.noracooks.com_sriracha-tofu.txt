Ingredients:
1 block extra-firm tofu ((16 oz))
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup water
2-3 tablespoons Sriracha hot sauce, depending on how much spice you like
5 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce (| tamari for gluten free)
3  cloves garlic, minced
1/3 cup granulated sugar
2 tablespoons cornstarch + 1/4 cup water, for thickening sauce
cooked white or brown rice
green onions, chopped
steamed broccoli or kale, if desired

Instructions:
Press the tofu: Wrap the block of tofu in paper towels. Place a plate or pan on top of the wrapped tofu, and put a couple of heavy books on top of that. Let the tofu press for 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Slice the tofu into 1 inch cubes and add them to a large ziplock bag, along with the olive oil, cornstarch and salt. Close the bag, and shake gently to coat the tofu pieces.&nbsp;
Arrange the tofu evenly on the prepared pan, and bake for 15 minutes. Flip and bake for 15 more minutes, until the tofu pieces are crispy and lightly golden brown. Remove from oven.
Make the Sauce:&nbsp;In a large pan, add all sauce ingredients except the cornstarch and water. Bring to a boil, and cook for a minute or two. Mix the cornstarch and water in a small bowl to combine, and then add to the pan. Whisk over medium-high heat constantly for a couple of minutes, until the sauce thickens.
Now add the crispy tofu to the pan with the sauce, and stir to coat.
Serve immediately with white or brown rice, chopped green onions, and steamed broccoli or kale, if desired. Sprinkle with red pepper flakes for even more heat.
