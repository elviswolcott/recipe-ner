Ingredients:
2 cups whole wheat flour
1/3  cup water
3/4 cup plant-based margarine
1/2 teaspoon salt
14 oz silken tofu
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon starch
1 teaspoon curcuma
1 tablespoon herbs de Provence (thyme, oregano, rosemary, and basil)
1 pinch kala namak
1 large leek
1 tablespoon olive oil
about 15  sun-dried tomatoes
about 15  black olives

Instructions:
Make the dough: Combine all ingredients in a bowl and knead into a smooth dough. Form a small ball and let it rest in the fridge for about 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, cut the leek into rings. In a medium pan, heat the olive oil and add the leek and a pinch of salt. Stir gently for about 4 minutes until it begins to soften. Set aside.
In a medium bowl, combine the silken tofu, the oil, the starch, curcuma, herbs de Provence and – if using – kala namak. Whisk until smooth. Chop the sun-dried tomatoes and cut the olives into rings. Add them together with the leek to the tofu-mixture and stir well.
Divide the dough into twelve portions and place twelve baking cups into a muffin tray. Evenly press the dough balls into the bottom and all the way up the sides of the muffin cups. Fill with the tofu-mixture and bake for 30-35 minutes at 180 C (356 F). Serve together with a green salad or as a snack. The mini quiches are also great when filled with mushrooms and spinach.
