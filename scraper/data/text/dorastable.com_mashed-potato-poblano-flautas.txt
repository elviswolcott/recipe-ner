Ingredients:
Nonstick cooking spray
1 tsp. Vegetable oil
1/2  Onion, white (diced small)
1  Poblano chile (diced small)
1 tsp. Whole cumin seeds
1 tsp. Salt
1/2 tsp. Freshly ground black pepper
3  Garlic cloves (minced)
2  Russet potatoes, baked or microwaved (skins discarded)
1 tbsp. Almond milk (unsweetened)
12  Corn tortillas

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 425°F. Lightly spray a nonstick baking sheet with a nonstick cooking spray.
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sauté the onion and poblano chile for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the onion is translucent. Add the cumin seeds, salt, pepper, and garlic. Sauté 4 more minutes. Remove from the heat.
In a large bowl, mix together the onion mixture, cooked potato, and almond milk. Mash well. Some visible chunks are fine.
Warm the tortillas until they are pliable.
To assemble the flautas, place 2 tbsp. of potato filling in each tortilla and roll it up tightly. Place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat until all the tortillas are rolled up.
Lightly spray the flautas with nonstick cooking spray and place in the oven. Bake 10 to 12 minutes , or until the edges of the tortillas are brown and crispy. Turn the pan halfway through the cooking time for even cooking.
