Ingredients:
(2) 8-ounce packages tempeh
18 ounces Vegan Barbecue Sauce*

Instructions:
Prep tempeh: Remove the tempeh from the packages, cut the blocks in half and steam in a pot for 10 minutes. This will remove any bitter flavors and make it absorb the marinade more. It&#039;s the trick to the best tempeh!
Once it&#039;s done steaming, pat dry and cut into 1/2 inch thick slices. Place in a large container for marinating.
Pour the bbq sauce over the tempeh. Stir gently, making sure all the pieces are coated in the sauce. Let the tempeh marinate for at least an hour, if possible, in the refrigerator. If you can marinate it overnight the flavor will be even better! But if you don&#039;t have time to marinate at all, it&#039;s okay, they will still be good.
Oven: Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the tempeh on it in a single layer. This will be a bit messy since they should be coated in bbq sauce. Brush a bit more bbq sauce on the top and bake for about 30 minutes. You can also broil for the last couple of minutes to brown the tops.
Grill: Place the bbq tempeh on a grill and grill on low-medium heat for about 15 minutes.
Leftover tempeh ribs will keep for 3-4 days in a covered container in the refrigerator. Reheat in the microwave, serve on sandwiches or make some vegan cheese grits to go with them!
