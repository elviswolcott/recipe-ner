Ingredients:
8 oz tempeh cut into thin strips
1 to 1.5 Tbsp red curry paste (check for shell fish or other fish ingredients)
2 Tbsp soy sauce
1 to 2 Tbsp maple or sweetener of choice
1/2 tsp garlic powder or 2 cloves of garlic minced
1/4 tsp black pepper
a few Tbsp water or coconut milk
1/2 tsp lemon zest (optional)

shredded carrots
thinly sliced celery or cucumber
fresh cilantro or basil or mint
chopped scallions
other additions : cooked rice noodles (mung bean sprouts, peanuts.)
salt and pepper to taste

manchurian sauce
Thai peanut sauce

Instructions:
Slice the tempeh into thin strips. Steam the tempeh for 10 minutes. Or boil in 2 cups of water for 10 minutes. Drain.
Mix all the ingredients for the marinade until a paste is formed. Add water or coconut milk if needed. Rub the marinade on all the tempeh strips. Let it chill for an hour or so.
Transfer the tempeh with the marinade into a large skillet. Add 2 to 3 Tbsp water. Cook over medium heat until all the marinade is absorbed or thickens and sticks to the strips. About 5 minutes.
Prep your roll station with chopped veggies and wrappers.
Dip each wrapper in warm water for 10 seconds, then place on a wet surface. Pile up the veggies, herbs and tempeh strips. Sprinkle salt and pepper if needed. Roll from one end to the middle, the fold the side edges in, and roll over to seal.
Serve with tonkatsu, manchurian sauce or thai peanut sauce.
