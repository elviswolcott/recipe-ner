Ingredients:
1/2 cup Chickpea flour (or gar-fava flour)
1.5 Tablespoon flaxseed meal
1/4 teaspoon turmeric (for color, optional)
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt (less if your feta is tangy)
a generous pinch of Indian black salt (kala namak)
1 Tablespoon nutritional yeast
a generous pinch of garlic powder
2 teaspoons chopped fresh herbs (I used oregano and thyme or a teaspoon of dried herbs.)
Chili flakes or black pepper to taste
1/2 cup coconut milk
1/2 cup water
1 Tablespoon extra virgin olive oil (optional, use 1 Tbspn more coconut milk)
1/2 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon maple or agave syrup
1/4 cup sauteed mushrooms or chopped mushrooms (I sauteed the mushrooms in a little oil for a few minutes)
1  large rainbow chard leaf chopped small  (or other greens)
1  large shallot chopped small
1/4 cup Ricki's Almond Feta cheese  (or Kite hill brand almond ricotta or other non dairy cheese crumbles)
Variations:
a few Tablespoons non dairy cheddar or mozzarella or jack
Add roasted squash

Instructions:
In a bowl, whisk all the dry ingredients for even distribution.
Add the wet to the dry, whisk into a smooth batter.
Add chard, mushrooms, veggies and crumbled cheese and mix.
Pour the thick batter into a greased or parchment lined pan. Spread evenly.
Bake for 35 minutes at 375 degrees F / 190Âºc or until toothpick from the center comes out almost clean. You want it just about done and not over baked.
Let rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing.
Serve hot or cold as is or with a side of roasted veggies or potatoes. Top with additional non dairy cheese or sauces of choice.
Can be kept refrigerated in a closed container for 2 days. Warm in the oven before serving.
The recipe can easily be doubled. The consistency of the batter should be thick, so adjust dry ingredients if needed for a larger batch.
