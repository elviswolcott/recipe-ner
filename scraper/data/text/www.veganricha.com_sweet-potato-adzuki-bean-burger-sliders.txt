Ingredients:
1  Sweet Potato or Yam boiled (peeled, mashed. about 1 cup mashed)
1 cup Adzuki beans (cooked or canned)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon berbere spice (or other spice blend of choice-Cajun, garam masala etc)
1/2 teaspoon chili flakes or to taste
1 Tablespoon onion flakes
1 Tablespoon nutritional yeast
2-4 Tablespoons flour (Wheat or Oat or any gf flour. I used 2 Tbsp wheat)
2  or more Tablespoons bread crumbs
1 Tbsp Extra virgin olive oil
1/4 cup bread crumbs to coat
Cucumber slices
Baby Spinach
Fresh Dill chopped
Dill Jalapeno aioli  (add a teaspoon of chopped Dill to the Aioli recipe.)
Multigrain buns/rolls.

Instructions:
Boil, peel and mash 1 large Sweet Potato or Yam.
Add the rest of the ingredients except 1/4 cup bread crumbs. Mix, mash, mix.
Taste and adjust salt if needed. Chill for 15 minutes so the mixture gets less sticky.
Make patties and coat in bread crumbs. I made 3 inch wide and 1/2-3/4 inch thick patties. The mixture might be sticky. Use flour or oil on hands to work. Once baked, the patties are quite sturdy.
(Use gf bread crumbs or coarsely ground Oats for glutenfree)
Bake for 25-30 minutes at 375 degrees F / 190c, until golden and dry on the outside.
Toast the buns/rolls lightly(optional)
Arrange Spinach on the buns, Top with a burger patty, Cucumbers, Dill Aioli, Fresh Dill and the top half of the bun.
