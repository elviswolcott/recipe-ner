Ingredients:
2 cups cooked chickpeas
2 cans artichoke hearts in brine, drained and roughly chopped
1/2 cup chopped red onion
2  cloves of garlic, minced
3 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
1  stalk of celery, chopped
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
1/4 cup chopped parsley
3 tablespoons chopped dill
1 cup panko bread crumbs
2 teaspoons vegan Worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons fish seasoning ((for example Old Bay) )
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste

Instructions:
In a pan, heat some oil and saut√© the chopped onion for 2 minutes. Then add the garlic and cook for another minute. Set aside.
Mash the chickpeas in a large bowl with a fork. Leave them partially intact for more texture. Add the remaining ingredients (including the cooked onion and the garlic) and season with salt and pepper.
Form eight vegan crab cakes.
Heat some oil in a large pan and cook them on each side on medium heat for about 2-3 minutes or until they're lightly browned.&nbsp;
I served them on a bed of green salad with vegan remoulade and lemon slices. For the remoulade I whisked together vegan mayonnaise with chopped dill, fresh lemon juice and seasoned it with salt and pepper.
