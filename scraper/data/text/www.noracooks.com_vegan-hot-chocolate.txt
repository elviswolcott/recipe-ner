Ingredients:
2 cups unsweetened almond milk
2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1-3 tablespoons granulated sugar
1/2 cup dairy free chocolate chips or chopped dark chocolate bar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
tiny pinch of salt
coconut whip cream, vegan marshmallows, chocolate shavings ((optional, for topping))

Instructions:
In a medium pot, add the almond milk, unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 tablespoon of sugar and chocolate chips.&nbsp;
Turn the heat to medium, and whisk to combine as it warms. The chocolate chips will slowly melt and it will become smooth and creamy. Do NOT bring the mixture to a boil, just heat and whisk until it's warm and smooth, then remove from heat.
Stir in the vanilla and a tiny pinch of salt. Taste for sweetness; add 2 more tablespoons for a sweeter drink (my kids prefer it sweeter, while I like it less sweet).&nbsp;
Pour into mugs and top with coconut whip, aquafaba whip or vegan marshmallows, if desired. Enjoy!
