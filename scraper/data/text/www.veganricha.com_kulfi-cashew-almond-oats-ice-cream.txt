Ingredients:
1/3 cup cashews
1/3 cup almonds
water
1/4 cup quick cooking oats
5-6 Tablespoons raw sugar or jaggery
1 Tablespoon of softened vegan butter (or high fat oil)
1/2 teaspoon saffron
1/2 teaspoon cardamom powder
1 teaspoon of arrowroot/cornstarch powder

Instructions:
Soak cashews and almonds overnight (I used 1/3 cup each). Nuke them in the microwave for a minute with a little water. You can also soak them for an hour and then nuke them in the microwave for 2-3 minutes. or blanch/cook in hot water for 2 minutes.
Puree the cashews and almonds with about 1/3 â€“ 1/2 cup warm-(more towards hot) water to make a creamy puree. I did not peel the almonds, you can peel them if your blender doesnt puree the mix smooth enough with the peel.
Add some quick cooking oats( 1/4 cup), 5-6 tablespoons raw sugar or jaggery(depending on the sweetness wanted) and a Tablespoon of softened vegan butter or high fat oil, 1/2 teaspoon saffron, 1/2 teaspoon cardamom powder and blend again. Add a little water if needed to get a thick puree consistency.
This puree now can be frozen as is, in popsicles or any container, or put in the icecream maker.
