Ingredients:
7 oz rice noodles
2 cups broccoli florets
1  red bell pepper, thinly sliced
1  carrot, thinly sliced
3/4 cup baby corn cobs
2  cloves of garlic, minced
3  green onions, cut into rings
1 piece of fresh ginger (about 1 inch)
4 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
2 tablespoons smooth peanut butter
1 tablespoon sambal olek, sriracha, or other chili paste
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
2 teaspoons brown sugar/ coconut sugar
1 tablespoon tamarind paste (optional)
black pepper
7 oz firm or extra-firm tofu
1 teaspoon sesame oil
2 teaspoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon corn starch
lime wedges
freshly chopped cilantro
roasted peanuts

Instructions:
Preheat your oven to 350 Â°F. Start by making the oven-baked crispy tofu. Cut the tofu into cubes. Place them in a bowl and add the sesame oil and the soy sauce. Stir well. Then add the corn starch. Make sure all cubes are covered in corn starch. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and place the tofu cubes on top. Bake for 25 minutes, tossing halfway.&nbsp;
Cook the rice noodles according to the instructions on the package.&nbsp;
Heat some oil in a large non-stick pan or wok. Add the garlic, the green onions, the ginger, and the chili and cook for 2-3 minutes.&nbsp;
Add the broccoli, the carrots, the baby corn, and the bell pepper. Cook for 7-8 minutes stirring frequently.&nbsp;
In the meantime, make the sauce. Combine the soy sauce, lime juice, rice vinegar, peanut butter, chili paste, ground ginger, black pepper, tamarind paste, and brown sugar in a bowl and stir well.
Add the cooked noodles and the sauce to the vegetables and stir well. Cook for another 1-2 minutes until heated through. Then add the baked tofu cubes. Serve with lime wedges, freshly chopped cilantro, and peanuts.&nbsp;
