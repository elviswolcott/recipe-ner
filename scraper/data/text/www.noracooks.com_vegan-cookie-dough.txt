Ingredients:
2 cups all purpose flour
1 cup vegan butter, softened
1 cup brown sugar, packed
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
2-4 tablespoons almond milk
1 cup mini vegan chocolate chips (or sprinkles)

Instructions:
Heat treat the flour so it&#39;s safe to eat. Place the flour in a microwave safe bowl and heat on high for 1 minute to 1 minute and 30 seconds, until the internal temperature reaches 166 degrees F. I use a candy thermometer to check it. Give it a stir and set aside to cool.
In the bowl of a stand mixer or a large bowl using a hand mixer, beat together the softened vegan butter, brown and white sugars. Scrape the sides as needed and beat for about a minute until fluffy and creamy.
Beat in the vanilla. Now add the flour and salt, and mix in until just combined. If the dough is dry, add in a tablespoon of almond milk at a time until the dough comes together.
Fold in the mini chocolate chips or sprinkles. Enjoy immediately with a spoon, make little cookie dough balls to add to ice cream or freeze for 2 months in a freezer safe bag or container. It will last for about 1 week in the refrigerator.
