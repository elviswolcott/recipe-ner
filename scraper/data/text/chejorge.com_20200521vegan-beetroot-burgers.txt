Ingredients:
1 medium -large beetroot
3  white mushrooms, sliced
2 clove of garlic, minced
1/2 cup of rolled oats
1/2 cup of flour
1 pinch of rosemary, chopped
1 medium shallot, roughly minced
1 heaping tablespoon light-brown miso
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon white pepper
vegetable oil, for frying

Instructions:
Prepare Vegetables. Peel the beetroot and chop it up roughly. Set that aside. Roughly slice the mushroom and mince the garlic. In a small pan, fry the mushroom and garlic (without oil). Fry them until the mushrooms have expelled all of its liquid, or until slightly caramelized. Once done, Take them off the heat and allow to cool just a little.
Make the Patties. In a food processor, blend together all the listed ingredients until the mixture becomes smooth and homogenous. The mixture might look purple and unappetizing right now, but once you cook it, it will return to that vibrant red. With damp* hands, shape the mixture into patties — the recipe should make three palm-sized patties. Place them on a parchment lined tray and allow them to chill in the refrigerator for at least an hour.
Cook the Patties. When you want to cook them, take them out of the fridge and let them sit on a room temperature counter for 10 minutes first. While waiting, heat up vegetable oil on HIGH heat. Sear the patties until both sides are deeply caramelized — golden brown and crispy. Drain on a paper towel, put them on your favorite burger buns, and enjoy.
