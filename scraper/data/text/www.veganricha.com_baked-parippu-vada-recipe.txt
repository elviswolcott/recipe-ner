Ingredients:
1 cup chana dal split chickpeas
2  green chilies (finely chopped)
1/2  medium onion (finely chopped)
2 tbsp grated ginger
10 to 12  curry leaves (finely chopped)
1/2 cup cilantro finely chopped
1/3 tsp or more salt
1/4 tsp red pepper flakes
1/4 tsp baking soda
2 tsp oil

Instructions:
Wash and Soak the dal/dals in warm water for 4 hours or overnight. Drain well.
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F / 220c.
Use a food processor or blender to grind the dals to a coarse puree. Use a few teaspoons of water if needed. Use as little water as possible. I often add ginger and cilantro in the processor instead of chopped.
Transfer mixture to a bowl and fold in the rest of the ingredients and oil. Shape the mixture into 2 to 3 inch size flat discs and place on parchment lined baking sheet. The mixture can be slightly wet. Use oiled hands or wet hands to shape.
Brush or spray oil on top. Bake for 16 to 20 minutes or until golden brown on top. Depending on the size of your patties and the lentils used, you might need to flip and bake for a few minutes longer. Bake till the desired color is achieved.
Cool for a few minutes before serving with coconut chutney or cilantro mint chutney or ketchup and Masala chai. The Vada are best served immediately for crisp results. They can be baked ahead and refrigerated. Reheat and serve.
