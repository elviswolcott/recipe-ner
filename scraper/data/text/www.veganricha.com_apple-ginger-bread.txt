Ingredients:
1 cup whole wheat flour
3 - 3.5 cups white bread flour
1/2 cup bran
1/2  medium sized apple pureed
1 inch of ginger pureed
1.5 teaspoons quick rise yeast and .5 teaspoon regular active yeast
1/2 cup water (use more if needed)
1/3 cup canola oil
1 teaspoon salt
1 Tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon lime juice

Instructions:
Warm the water and add yeast to it. Let sit for 10 minutes or until frothy.
Grease the mixer bowl and add the flours, bran, sugar and salt to it. Start with 2 cups (260g) bread flour and add more later if necessary.
Puree the Apple and ginger with little water to get a nice smooth puree.
Add the puree, oil, lime juice and yeast to the flours and give a mix.
Add in the yeast mixture and knead. Add more flour or water if necessary.
As with all watery fruits, the fruit will give out more moisture with time, so try to keep the dough a little on the dry side.
Knead for 10-12 minutes( 2-3 minute batches in mixer with intermittent scraping)
Place dough in a well oiled container, spray some oil, cover with plastic wrap with enough room to double in size.
Punch dough down after an hour an half.
Shape into a loaf by pulling on all sides and tucking it under.
Place loaf in greased bread pan and cover with kitchen towel.
Let rise for another 45 minutes.
Bake at 375 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until nice, golden and sounds hollow.
Take bread out of bread pan and cool completely before slicing!
I store all breads with any fruit in it in the refrigerator and use them within 4-5 days.
