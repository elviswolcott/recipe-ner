Ingredients:
1  onion, chopped
3  cloves of garlic, minced
2 1/2 cups vegetable broth
1 cup canned coconut milk (full fat)
9 oz spaghetti
3 cups fresh spinach
lemon juice of 1/2 lemon
1 teaspoon lemon zest
salt
pepper
red pepper flakes

Instructions:
In a large pot, heat some oil and saut√© the onion for 3 minutes until it becomes translucent. Then add the garlic and cook for another minute.
Add the uncoooked spaghetti, the vegetable broth, the coconut milk, and the lemon juice. Stir a couple of times and gently push the spaghetti in the liquid when they're soft enough (this might take a couple of minutes. Try not to break them when they're still too hard). Cook for 15-18 minutes.
When the spaghetti are al dente, stir in the spinach and the lemon zest. Cook for 2 more minutes and season with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Enjoy!
