Ingredients:
1 15 oz can  kidney beans
1 cup almond milk
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 cup cocoa powder
1 cup whole wheat flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 3.5 oz package vegan dark chocolate
4 tablespoons hazelnut brittle (You can also sub it with chopped hazelnuts, or use sugar sprinkles or coconut flakes instead)

Instructions:
Rinse and drain the kidney beans. Place them into a blender together with the brown sugar, almond milk, and cacao and blend until the mixture is smooth.
Then transfer it to a medium bowl and stir in the whole-wheat flour, the baking powder, and vanilla. Spray the donut pan with cooking spray or grease it with vegan butter such as Earth Balance.
Either use a spoon to fill each donut or fill the batter into a Ziploc bag and cut off one edge.
Preheat the oven to 350 F and bake the vegan chocolate hazelnut donuts for 9-11 minutes. Allow to cool down in the pan for a couple of minutes, then move them to a cooling rack.
In the meantime, make the chocolate glaze. Melt a 3.5-ounce package vegan dark chocolate either by using a microwave or place the chocolate into a heatproof bowl and place it over a pan of barely simmering water. Once melted, cover the donuts with the chocolate and sprinkle with hazelnut brittle.
