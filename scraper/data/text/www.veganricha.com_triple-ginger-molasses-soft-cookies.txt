Ingredients:
1 Tablespoon flax seed meal
2 Tablespoons warm water
1/4 cup oil (I use organic non gmo canola oil or refined coconut, or use Applesauce)
1/4 cup ground raw sugar
3 Tablespoons Blackstrap Molasses
1.5 cups Spelt flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
1/2 teaspoon ginger powder
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon powder
1/4 teaspoon cloves powder
2 teaspoons grated ginger
1/4 cup crystallized/candied ginger chopped small
Raw sugar for coating

Instructions:
In a bowl, mix flaxmeal with 2 Tablespoons of water and let sit for 5 minutes.
Whisk in the oil, molasses and sugar until well combined.
In another bowl, mix the flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda and all spices.
Add the wet to dry. Add grated and candied ginger and mix.
Press and mix into a dough. It will take 2-3 minutes to form a dough. Use hands if needed.
The dough will be a non sticky, not too hard dough. Chill the dough for 15 minutes.
Shape into flat disks. Press the disks into sugar and place on parchment lined sheet.
Bake in pre-heated 350 degrees F&nbsp; / 180Âºc for 12-13 minutes.
The cookies will be slightly soft in the center to touch.
Let them cool completely on the counter (15-20 minutes). they will harden as they cool.
Store in an airtight container for a few days.
