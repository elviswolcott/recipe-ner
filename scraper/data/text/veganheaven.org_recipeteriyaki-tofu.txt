Ingredients:
14 oz very firm or extra-firm tofu
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon maple syrup
3 tablespoons mirin or rice wine vinegar
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon fresh ginger, chopped
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1  small head of broccoli

Instructions:
Preheat your oven to 350 F. Cut the tofu into cubes and put it in a bowl. Add two tablespoons of corn starch. 
Make sure all cubes are covered in corn starch.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and place the tofu cubes on top.
Bake for 25 minutes, tossing halfway. 
Cut the broccoli into florets and cook or steam it. I like mine still a bit crunchy and not too soft. 
Make the sauce: Place all of the ingredients into a sauce pan and cook for 3-4 minutes on medium heat until the sauce becomes thick and sticky. 
Add the baked tofu cubes and stir well. Serve over brown rice and add the broccoli as a side. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and freshly chopped green onion. Enjoy!
