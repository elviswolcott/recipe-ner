Ingredients:
1 cup rolled oats
4 cups water
2  Medjool dates, pitted
1 pinch  salt

Instructions:
Place the oats, the dates, and the salt in the blender.
Add the water. 
Blend until smooth. Don&#039;t overblend or the milk might get slimy. 30 seconds to 1 minute is enough. 
Strain the milk using a nut milk bag, a clean towel, dishcloth, or a strainer. Do not press the pulp to get more milk out as this will make the milk slimy as well. 
Fill into glass bottles or an airtight container and store in the fridge.
