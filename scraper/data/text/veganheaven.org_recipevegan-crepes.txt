Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour or spelt flour
2 1/4 cups unsweetened oat, soy, or almond milk
2 1/4 cups sparkling water
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon lemon juice
2 tablespoons melted coconut oil
1/2 teaspoon natural vanilla extract
2-3 tablespoons brown sugar or coconut sugar
1 teaspoon ground flaxseeds
1 pinch salt

Instructions:
Combine the dry ingredients in a medium-sized bowl. Melt the coconut oil in a small pot on the stovetop or in the microwave.
Add the sparkling water, the plant-based milk, the coconut oil, the lemon juice, and the vanilla extract. If you want to eat your crepes with a savory filling, leave out the sugar and the vanilla extract.
Stir the batter well with a whisk until there are no lumps left.
Heat some oil in a large non-stick pan (it should be only lightly oiled) and bake one crepe at a time. Use about 1/4 to 1/2 cup for each crepe depending on the size of your pan. Quickly swirl, so the batter covers the entire bottom of your pan.
Stack the ready crepes on a plate and put them in the oven at around 140 Â°F. This way they will keep warm until you're finished making all of the crepes.
