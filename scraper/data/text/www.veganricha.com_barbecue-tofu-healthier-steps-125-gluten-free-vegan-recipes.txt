Ingredients:
Batter
1 pound extra firm tofu, drained and pressed
 cup creamy peanut butter or tahini paste
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon onion powder
 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon nutritional yeast flakes (optional)
 teaspoon sea salt
Pinch cumin
Barbecue Sauce
2 teaspoons olive oil or 2 tablespoons water
 cup minced onion
1 clove garlic
28 ounces tomato puree or sauce
 cup maple syrup
2 tablespoons coconut palm sugar
1 tablespoon pomegranate molasses
1 tablespoon parsley flakes
2 tablespoons Bragg’s liquid aminos or coconut aminos
 teaspoon sesame oil (optional)
Sea salt to taste

Instructions:
For barbecue sauce: In a medium saucepan, heat oil or water on medium heat. Add onion and cook until soft, about 4 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Add tomato sauce, maple syrup, coconut palm sugar, molasses, parsley, Bragg’s liquid aminos, sesame oil and sea salt to taste. Reduce heat to simmer for 15–20 minutes, stirring constantly until sauce is thickened.
For Tofu: Preheat oven 400F/200C. Drain water from tofu and squeezed excess water out between paper towels or a clean dishcloth. Cut tofu in long strips and set aside. Combine batter in a bowl and mix well. Coat individual tofu strips with batter mix and place on an oiled 9x13 casserole dish. Bake tofu for 20 minutes, or until tofu is golden brown.
Evenly coat tofu with barbecue sauce and return to the oven for 5-10 minutes.
Chef’s Tip: Unsulphured molasses can be used as substitute for pomegranate molasses
