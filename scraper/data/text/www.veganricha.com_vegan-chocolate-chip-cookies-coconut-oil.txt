Ingredients:
1/2 cup solid not melted organic refined coconut oil (on the scant side)
1.5 tablespoons ground flax seeds mixed with 4.5 tablespoons water (let sit for 5 mins until smooth and creamy)
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup organic unrefined sugar (fine sugar or blend to make powder)
1/4 teaspoon heaped fine sea salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
2 tsp organic vanilla extract
1 1/4  cups flour (I use unbleached white flour)
1 cup vegan fair trade palmoil free chocolate chips and chunks

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F / 180Âºc. Line a large baking sheet with parchment.
Add all ingredients coconut oil through vanilla extract to a stand mixer and beat until light and fluffy. Or add a bowl and beat with a hand held beater until fluffy.
Add 1 cup flour and mix in. Add 1/4 cup flour and mix in. Add flour 1 tbsp at a time and beat in to make a soft cookie dough. You dont want a crumbly dryish mixture, so add just enough to get to somewhere between a stiff batter and soft dough. *
Add the chocolate chips and fold in well. **
Measure dough out by heaped tablespoon or a scoop on the lined baking sheet.
Bake for 10 minutes or until just slightly golden.
Remove from oven and "cookie slam" on a solid heat proof surface for the wrinkled cookie appearance.
Let cool on baking sheet for 2-3 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack and let cool for another 3-5 minutes. The cookies set up while they cool. Try to share with everyone. Store on the counter for the day, and in a closed container for upto 3 days (totally irrelevant information),
