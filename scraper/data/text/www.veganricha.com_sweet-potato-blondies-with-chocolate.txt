Ingredients:
1 cup brown rice flour  (or white rice flour)
1/4 cup amaranth flour  (or sorghum or millet other gf flour)
1 Tbsp cornstarch or arrowroot starch
1.5 tsp pumpkin pie spice blend (or add 1/2 tsp cinnamon &amp; ginger, 1/4 tsp clove &amp; nutmeg)
1/2 tsp baking powder
a generous pinch of baking soda
1/2 cup Sweet potato puree (I used canned)
1/4 cup almond milk  (or other non dairy milk)
1 Tbsp flax seed meal
1 Tbsp molasses
1 tsp apple cider vinegar
2/3 cup ground raw sugar (1-2 Tbsp more for sweeter)
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 cup oil (I use organic canola)
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/3 cup mini chocolate chips (or add chopped walnuts/pecans )

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 360 degrees F / 160c. In a bowl, whisk all the dry ingredients.
In another bowl, add all the ingredients under wet and mix well. Let sit for 2 minutes.
Combine wet with dry and mix until well combined. Fold in the chocolate chips or nuts if using. Or add both.
The batter will be thick and stiff-ish and it will continue to get stiff if it sits. Once chocolate chips are mixed in, drop the batter on parchment lined or greased pan. Using a spatula flatten it out.
Bake for 40-50 minutes until a toothpick from the center comes out almost clean. You will know when it is ready as the house will start smelling delicious.
Remove pan from oven. Let cool for 10-15 minutes before removing from pan. The blondie crust softens and also gets easier to cut into squares as it cools. Cut into squares and serve with vanilla ice cream or salted caramel or whipped coconut cream, or all of them.
Variations: use Pumpkin instead of sweet potato puree. Add a Tablespoon more almond milk and oil.
