Ingredients:
1/4 cup full fat coconut milk
1/2 tsp cornstarch (optional)
2-3 Tbsp ground sugar
1/2 cup vegan dark chocolate  (or vegan semi sweet chocolate)
3/4 cup smooth almond butter
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1/4 tsp cinnamon
1  cup Coco whip or coconut cream

Instructions:
Mix coconut milk with cornstarch and sugar and heat in a pan over medium heat until just about a boil. Take off heat and mix well so the sugar is well dissolved. Let it sit for 1 minute. Add the chocolate and let it sit for 1 more minute. Whisk until melted. Wait for the mixture to be warm to touch as some nut butters might separate when mixed in a hot mixture. Add in the almond butter and whisk and whisk until smooth using a hand mixer or whisk.
Add vanilla extract and cinnamon. Fold in the coconut cream and whisk and whip. Add more coconut cream and whip longer for a lighter mousse. Pour the mixture into ramekins. Let them chill for a few hours (this gives a great texture) before serving with a dollop of coco whip or vanilla ice cream.
