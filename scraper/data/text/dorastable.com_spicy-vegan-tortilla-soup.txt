Ingredients:
8  Corn tortillas (cut into ½ in. strips)
(12 oz.) or 1 block Extra firm tofu, pressed, cut into ½ inch cubes
2  Roma tomatoes, (large)
¼  White Onion, (rough chopped)
1-2  Chile chipotle peppers in adobo
1  Dried Chile morita, (de-seeded, crumbled)
8 ½ cups Vegetable stock
1 cup Diced tomates, canned, fire roasted
2  Garlic cloves, (peeled)
1 tsp. Soy sauce or braggs liquid aminos ((see notes))
1 sprig Epazote (fresh)
2  Avocadoes, (cut in half, pitted, diced)
3  Dried chile pasilla
Almond crema ((optional))
1  Lime, cut into quarters

Instructions:
Pre-heat oven to 350°F.
Place the tofu and tortilla strips on a sheet tray lined with parchment paper. Bake for approximately 20 min. or until the tortillas are crispy and the tofu is slightly browned. Remove from oven and set aside.
In the meantime, bring water to a boil in a small pot and add whole tomatoes. Reduce heat and gently simmer for 3-4 min., or until tomatoes are soft and the skin begin to fall off them. Set tomatoes aside.
In a blender, puree cooked tomatoes, onion, chile morita, chipotle chiles, 2 ½ cups of HOT vegetable stock, tomato puree, garlic, and soy sauce until smooth.
Heat a large pot to medium heat and add the tomato-chile puree to it. Let it simmer for 1-2 minutes, until it slightly thickens and changes color. Add&nbsp;the rest of the vegetable stock, epazote spring, and baked tofu to the pot and bring to a simmer. Let simmer for 15 min. and season to taste.
