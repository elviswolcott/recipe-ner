Ingredients:
150 grams wheat noodles
2 tablespoons Taiwanese sesame paste (see notes for substitutes)
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 teaspoon brown sugar (or regular sugar)
1 teaspoon black vinegar (or rice vinegar)
2 teaspoons light soy sauce
4 tablespoons room temperature water
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 tablespoon white sesame seeds
thinly sliced cucumbers

Instructions:
Make the Cold Noodles. Cook noodles according to package instructions. Drain noodles and soak in ice water while you prepare the sauce.
Make the Sauce. Simply whisk together sesame paste (or peanut butter), sesame oil, brown sugar, black vinegar, soy sauce, and water. Note: most people only regard sesame paste as traditional, but actually peanut butter is traditional too. Peanut butter is a popular choice especially in Southern Taiwan.
To Finish. Drain noodles from the ice bath and toss together with sauce. Top with minced garlic, sesame seeds, and thinly sliced cucumbers. Enjoy immediately.
