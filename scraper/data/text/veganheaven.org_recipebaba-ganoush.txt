Ingredients:
2 medium eggplants
3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
2  cloves of garlic
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup tahini
3 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons chopped parsley

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 F.
With a sharp knife, cut the eggplant into half lengthwise. Line a baking tray with parchment paper and place the eggplant halves on top with the flesh-side facing up.
Brush with olive oil (I used about one tablespoon in total).
Bake them for 40 minutes. Cover them with aluminium foil for the last 10-15 minutes, so they don't become too brown.
Let the eggplants cool down for about 10 minutes, so they are easier to handle. In the meanwhile place the remaining ingredients into a food processor.
Scrape out the flesh of the eggplant with a spoon and add it to the tahini mixture. Process until smooth.
Sprinkle with freshly chopped parsley, some more olive oil, and red pepper flakes. Serve with warm pita bread. Enjoy!
