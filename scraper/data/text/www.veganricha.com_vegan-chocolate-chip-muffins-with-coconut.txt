Ingredients:
1 cup non dairy milk such as almond or coconut
1/2 cup maple syrup ((add 1 tbsp sugar for sweeter))
3/4 cup coconut flakes
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 tsp cinnamon or other spices (, optional)
1/2 tsp vinegar ((apple cider vinegar or white))
1 1/4 cup flour ((I use half whole wheat pastry/spelt and half all purpose))
1.5 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/3 tsp salt
2/3 cup vegan chocolate chips  (and 2 tbsp for topping)

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a muffin tin with liners. In a blender, combine all the wet ingredients and blend for a minute to break down most of the coconut.
In a bowl mix all the dry ingredients well. Add the blended wet mixture. Mix to just about combine. (Add 1 tbsp oil if you plan to store these for longer).
Fold in the chocolate chips. Spoon the batter into muffin pan.&nbsp;
Bake at 375 degrees F for 20 to 25 mins.&nbsp;To make a loaf, bake for 45 minutes or until a toothpick from the center comes out clean.
