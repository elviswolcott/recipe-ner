Ingredients:
4  Bolillos or French rolls
1 can (15.5 oz.) Black beans
2  Avocadoes
1  Onion (white, sliced thinly)
2  Tomatoes (large, sliced)
½ - 1 lb. Homemade vegan chorizo (see note)

Instructions:
Heat a large sauté pan to medium heat. Add 1 tbsp. of oil or water (if you are oil-free). Add chorizo and cook for 5-6 minutes or until it begins to slightly brown. Remove from heat and set aside.
Cut the avocadoes in half, remove the pits, and scoop out the flesh with a spoon into a bowl. Mash with a fork and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.
Drain the black beans, but reserve 2-3 tbsp. of the liquid. Mash the beans with a fork or a potato masher until they reach the consistency of refried beans. (You can, of course, use real refried beans instead.) I like to add 2 tbsp. of salsa instead of the canned bean liquid.
Slice the rolls in half, lengthwise and scoop out some of the soft interior. Spread 2 tbsp. or more of the avocado on the top half of the bread, and top with 2 slices of onion.
Spread 2 tbsp. or more of the beans on the bottom half of the bread. Divide the chorizo mixture between the bottom half of the 4 rolls. Top with 2-3 slices of tomato, and cover with top half of bread.
Heat a griddle or cast iron pan over medium heat. Once hot, place the tortas on it and cook for about 5 min, on each side. You can place a heavy sauté pan on top of the tortas while they are cooking to give it a panini effect, or just use a panini press.
Serve with pickled jalapeños.
