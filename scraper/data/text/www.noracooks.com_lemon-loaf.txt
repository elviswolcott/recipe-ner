Ingredients:
6 ounces silken tofu (1/2 package)
1/4 cup canola oil
1 cup non-dairy milk
1 cup granulated sugar
zest from 1 lemon
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons  baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup powdered sugar
1 tablespoon non-dairy milk
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice

Instructions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and lightly grease a standard loaf pan.
Blend all of the wet ingredients in a blender until smooth.
In a large bowl, whisk together all the dry ingredients. Now pour the wet mixture into the dry and mix with a large spoon until just combined. Do not over mix.&nbsp;
Pour into the prepared pan and bake for 35-45 minutes, until golden brown and a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Let the loaf cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then move to a cooling rack.
While the loaf cools, add the icing ingredients to a medium sized bowl and whisk until smooth. Once the loaf is cooled, drizzle or pour the glaze on top of the loaf. Let the glaze harden, if desired, before slicing and serving. Enjoy!
