1/2 tsp nigella seeds
2  bay leaves
2  dried red chilies
1  small onion (chopped)
5 cloves of garlic  (chopped)

1 tsp coriander powder
1/2 tsp turmeric
1/4 tsp black pepper
2  medium tomatoes pureed (or 1.5 cups puree)
20 oz can green Jackfruit, drained, rinsed and squeezed to remove excess brine. Also chop into smaller pieces if too big.
1/2 to 3/4 tsp salt or to taste
1 to 1.5 cups water

Instructions:
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. When hot, add cumin, mustard and nigella seeds and let them start to sizzle or pop. 1 minute. Add bay leaves and red chilies and cook for a few seconds. Add in the onion, garlic and ginger and a pinch of salt. Cook until translucent. 5 to 6 minutes. Stir occasionally.
Add coriander, turmeric, black pepper and mix well. Add pureed tomato, salt and Jackfruit. Mix. Cover and cook for 15 minutes.
Uncover and cook for a few minutes to thicken the tomato puree. Also, shred the Jackfruit a bit if you like.
Add water, cover and cook for 15 minutes. Taste and adjust salt and spice. Reduce heat to medium low and cover and cook for another 10 minutes or longer until desired consistency. Garnish with cilantro and serve.
