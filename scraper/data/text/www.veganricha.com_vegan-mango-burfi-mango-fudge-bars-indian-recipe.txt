Ingredients:
1/4 cup finely ground oats  (or oat flour)
1/4 cup finely ground cashews
1/3 cup coconut flour (loaded)
a pinch of salt
1 to 2 Tbsp ground sugar (depends on the sweetness of the mango)
1/2 cup +2 Tbsp mango puree (ripe mango pureed , for best results use thick canned mango puree or pulp (sweetened or unsweetened))
a generous pinch of cardamom or saffron (or 1/2 tsp vanilla extract or omit)

Instructions:
Dry roast oat flour in a skillet, for 3 to 4 minutes on medium low heat.
Add cashews, coconut flour, salt and mix well for half a minute to incorporate all the flours.
Add sugar, mango puree, cardamom or saffron, and mix well. Keep mixing and the mixture will thicken considerably within a minute or 2. Taste carefully and add more sugar if needed. Mix and take off heat.
*If the mixture seems like it is too liquidy/sticky, add more coconut and oat flour a tsp at a time and mix in. If too thick, add more mango puree and mix in.
Drop the mixture on parchment and press down with a clean spatula. Shape into a square and chill for an hour. Slice and serve. The bars will very soft if the moisture content in the mango was too high and firm fudgy if the mango was ripe and the puree was thick. You can serve them as halwa in a bowl if too soft. Press almond or pistachio slivers on top of each bar. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for upto 4 days.
