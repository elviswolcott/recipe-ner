Ingredients:
4 cups watermelon cubes
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons sesame oil
2 tablespoons sesame seeds
3 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
1 cup cooked brown rice
1  large carrot
3/4 cup frozen edamame
1/2  cucumber
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
salt, to taste
red pepper flakes, to taste
1 cup store-bought seaweed salad
2 cups red cabbage, finely sliced
1  avocado
1/2 cup vegan mayonnaise
1 tablespoon sriracha
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
1 pinch salt

Instructions:
With a sharp knife slice the watermelon in 1 inch slices.
Then cut these slices into cubes. You will need about 4 cups of watermelon cubes.
In a bowl, combine the ingredients for the marinade (soy sauce, sesame oil, and rice vinegar). Pour the dressing over the watermelon cubes and carefully stir until well combined. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and green onions cut into rings.
Transfer everything into a ziploc bag and put it in the fridge. Allow to marinate overnight or for at least 12 hours.
Chop up all of the other ingredients. Start with the cucumber by cutting it into thin slices. In a small bowl, then combine 2 tablespoons of rice vinegar, salt, and chili flakes. Pour it over the cucumber and let it rest for about 10 minutes.
In the meanwhile prepare the other ingredients.&nbsp;Cook the edamame (I used frozen edamame). Spiralize the carrots, and cut the avocado and the cabbage into thin stripes.&nbsp;
For the sauce, combine vegan mayonnaise with sriracha sauce. Use more sriracha sauce for a spicier sauce. Serve everything in a big bowl over rice and sprinkle it with green onions and sesame seeds.
