Ingredients:
1 tbsp organic canola oil (or use organica safflower oil)
1 1/2 tbsp powdered/fine sugar
2 tsp brown sugar or coconut sugar
1 tsp maple syrup
1 tsp orange juice
1/4 tsp vanilla extract (3 to 4 drops)
1/4 tsp nutritional yeast (optional - it adds a deeper saltier flavor)
a good pinch of salt
2 1/2-3 tbsp unbleached white flour
a good pinch of baking soda (about a 1/16th tsp)
1 1/2 tbsp or more vegan chocolate chunks or chips (I use enjoy life brand, that uses cocoa butter, no palm oil)
sea salt or maldon salt for sprinkling.

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 deg F / 180ºc.
In a bowl, add the ingredients oil through salt. Mix well until well combined and you don't see big drops of oil floating around.
Add 2.5 tbsp flour and sprinkle baking soda on the flour and mix well. Add a tsp flour at a time to make a thick batter mixture. Usually 3 Tbsp works out perfectly. Depending on the measurement of the wet ingredients, you might need a tsp less or more. The mixture should be thick batter, or stiff batter.
Fold in the chocolate chunks. Drop mixture on parchment lined baking sheet and flatten slightly. Sprinkle salt on the cookie and press in.
Bake at 350 deg F / 180ºc for 11 to 13 minutes till the edges just about start to turn golden. Tap the baking sheet and let it cool. The cookies will be soft right out of the oven, but will cool to be fudgy within 5-10 mins. Cool completely before storing.
