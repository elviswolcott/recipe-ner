Ingredients:
1 pint fresh blueberries
Juice of one lemon
Zest of 1/4 Lemon
2 tbsp sugar (or maple or another sweetener of choice)
1 pinch  salt
2 tbsp water
1 Cup Old Fashioned Rolled Oats (, Certified gluten-free if needed)
2 tsp Chia Seeds
1 1/2 cups Warm Non-Dairy Milk (Such as almond, oat, soy, light coconut milk )
Zest of 1/4 Lemon
a drop of vanilla extract
1 tbsp sugar (or maple syrup or sweetener of choice)
blueberries (or other berries of choice)
chopped roasted nuts or seeds of choice

Instructions:
To make the Blueberry Compote,combine all the Blueberry Compote ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Mash the Blueberries, and continue to cook until tender and the mixture thickens a bit.
Let the mixture sit and cool.
In a separate bowl, combine the Oats, Chia Seeds, Warmed non Dairy Milk, Lemon Zest, Vanilla Extract, and 1 tbsp of sweetener of choice.
Mix and chill for 15 minutes. This will help thicken the mixture, so that it&#039;s easier to pour into your overnight jars. (If it hasnâ€™t thickened to preference, add in 1-3 tbsp more oats and a tsp or so more chia seeds and let sit again)
Pour your compote into 2 or 3 jars, depending on the size.
Distribute your oat mixture into the jars.
Top them with Blueberries, or other berries of choice, and some chopped roasted walnuts, pecans, pumpkin seeds, hemp seeds, or chia seeds.
Chill overnight, and serve!
