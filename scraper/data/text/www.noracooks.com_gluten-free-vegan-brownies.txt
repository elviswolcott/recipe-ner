Ingredients:
2 tablespoons ground flaxseeds
1/2 cup soy milk (*or almond/coconut milk)
1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce
3/4 cup granulated sugar  (*or coconut sugar)
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/2 cup almond flour
1/2 cup all purpose gluten free flour (*I used Bob&#039;s Red Mill 1:1 Flour)
1/2 cup cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup chopped walnuts or non-dairy chocolate chips, optional

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line an 8x8 inch pan with parchment paper for easy removal of the brownies.
In a medium mixing bowl, stir together the ground flaxseeds and soy milk. Let them sit for about 2 minutes to thicken slightly.
To the bowl with the flaxseed/milk mixture, add the applesauce, sugar and vanilla. Stir well to combine. Now add the almond flour, gluten free flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt and stir everything together until just combined.
Fold in the optional walnuts or chocolate chips (or a mixture of both), if desired.
Scoop the batter into the prepared pan and smooth out the top evenly. Bake for 25 minutes. Let the brownies cool for 15-30 minutes if possible before serving.
