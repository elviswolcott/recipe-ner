Ingredients:
3 cups whole wheat flour
1 cup all purpose flour
2 teaspoons active yeast
juice of one orange
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup maple syrup
2 teaspoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
2 teaspoons orange zest ((i added 1 teaspoon this time, and that wasn't enough))
1/2 cup non dairy milk
2 teaspoons oil
1 teaspoon vegan butter (melted)

Instructions:
Warm the milk and add yeast to it. Mix well and let stand for 10 minutes.
In a large pan ,add sugar, honey, salt, nutmeg and all purpose flour and mix well.
Add in the milk and mix well.
Add in the orange juice, raisins, zest and 1 cup whole wheat flour. Mix well.
Add in 1 cup flour at a time and knead into a soft dough. Use some water if necessary.
Place dough in a well oiled container, covered in a warm oven for about an hour.
Knead the dough again and make into a bread pan loaf.
Place dough in the bread pan.
Place bread pan in warm oven with a container of boiling water for about 30 minutes.
Remove the pan of water.
Cover the bread pan with a disposable lasagna pan deep enough to have a couple of inches above the pan. (I found this tip on another baking blog, to trap the steam and get a great crust)
Bake in pre-heated oven at 350 degrees F for about 25 minutes. Remove lasagna pan after the first 10 mins.
Brush melted butter on top.
Cool on rack before slicing.
