Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons neutral flavored oil, such as canola, melted refined coconut, or avocado oil
1 cup unsweetened soy milk
1 cup sparkling water OR regular water
2-4 tablespoons vegan butter, for the pan
2-3 lemons sliced, for serving
2-4 tablespoons powdered sugar
berries, optional for serving
maple syrup, for serving

Instructions:
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cornstarch, sugar and salt. Now add the oil, non-dairy milk and sparkling water OR regular water (sparkling water makes them even lighter, but is not necessary). Whisk well until smooth and well combined.
Heat a medium sized, non-stick pan to medium heat. Once hot, add a tablespoon or two of vegan butter to the pan. Once melted, add about 1/3 cup of the batter to the pan. Immediately pick up the pan and rotate it to move the batter into a thin circle.
Cook until the top looks fairly dry, about 2 minutes. Using a spatula, carefully flip the crepe over and cook for 30 seconds on the other side. Remove from pan and repeat with the rest of the batter.
Serve: My favorite way to serve crepes is by squirting a little lemon juice on the crepe, add some powdered sugar, and roll or fold. Dust with more powdered sugar and serve with fresh berries and maple syrup.
