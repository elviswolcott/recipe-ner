Ingredients:
1 cup non dairy milk such as almond, light coconut, oat or soy
1.5 tbsp applesauce or non dairy yogurt or more non dairy milk ((Yogurt work best))
1 tsp Apple cider or white vinegar
1/4 cup neutral oil (or use 3 tbsp applesauce to make oil-free)
1/3 cup sugar (1 tbsp more for sweeter)
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
a few drops of almond extract (optional but wonderful)
1.5 to 1.75 cups  flour (I use All purpose flour. see GF option in notes)
1.5 tbsp cornstarch
2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 to 3/4 cup Raspberry preserves
1 cup Coconut Whipped Cream

Instructions:
Line two 6 inch springform pans with parchment paper. Preheat the oven to 350 F (176 C). In a bowl, mix the wet ingredients until the sugar is fully combined.
In another bowl, whisk 1 1/2 cup flour,  cornstarch, baking powder, baking soda and salt. (Add spices of choice if you like. Add berries, or pineapple, or candied ginger if you like. Add 2 tbsp almond flour to the dry for additional texture (optional)).
Fold dry into the wet ingredients until just about combined. Add more flour if needed 1 tbsp at a time to make just slightly thick batter. Pour into the parchment lined pans.
Bake for 20 to 22 minutes or until a toothpick from the center comes out clean. Remove the pan from the oven and cool for 10 minutes then remove the cakes from the pan.
Let the cake cool completely. Then put in the fridge for half an hour. Use a serrated knife to slice off the domed top. **
Warm the preserves in the microwave so that they are easier to spread. Add the jam on one of the cakes layers and spread evenly using a butter knife or offset spatula. Place the other cake on top. Top of this layer cake with some whipped coconut cream and fruit of choice. Slice and enjoy. Baked cakes without frosting can be stored in a covered container in the fridge for upto 7 days.  If frosted, then Depending on the frosting they can be stored for 3-5 days.
