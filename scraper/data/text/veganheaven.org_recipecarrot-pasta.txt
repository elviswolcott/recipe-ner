Ingredients:
2 large carrots
1 small red onion
2  cloves of garlic
1/4 cup cashews
3/4 cup unsweetened almond milk
1/2 cup vegetable broth
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste
1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika powder
freshly chopped parsley to sprinkle (optional)
9 oz fettuccine or pasta of choice

Instructions:
Peel the carrots and cut them into sticks. Cut the red onion into strips. Peel the garlic but leave it whole.
Preheat the oven to 350 F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and place the carrots, the red onion, and the garlic on top. Bake for 10 minutes. In the meantime, cook the pasta according to the instructions on the package.
Carefully transfer the baked vegetables into a food processor or high speed blender. Add the cashews, the unsweetened almond milk, the vegetable broth, the smoked paprika powder, and salt and pepper. Process until smooth.
Pour the sauce into a pan and cook it for about 2-3 minutes until it thickens up and is completely warmed through. Serve it over pasta and sprinkle with freshly chopped parsley if you want.
