Ingredients:
1/2 cup chickpea flour  (or gram flour besan)
1 tsp oil
1/3 tsp or more cumin seeds
1/2 cup onion
3 cloves of garlic
1  green chile (finely chopped (optional))
1/2  green bell pepper
1/2  red bell pepper
1.5 to 2 cups chopped broccoli (small pieces)
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp turmeric powder
1/4-1/2 tsp cayenne (red chili powder)
2 tsp coriander powder
1/4 tsp fennel seeds
lemon juice and chopped cilantro for garnish

Instructions:
Dry roast the chickpea flour in a skillet over medium heat for 4 to 5 minutes or until toasty. (Stir occasionally to avoid burning) . Keep aside. I usually transfer the flour to a bowl and use the same skillet for the next step.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. when hot, add cumin seeds and roast them until they change color. 1 to 2 minutes.
Add onion, garlic, green chile and cook for 3 mins or until the garlic is translucent. Add peppers and mix and cook for 2 minutes. Add broccoli and a generous pinch of salt and mix in. Add a good splash of water, mix well, and cook for 5 to 7 minutes or until broccoli is cooked to al dente.
Mix the spices and salt into the roasted chickpea flour and add to the skillet. Mix well. Cover and cook a minute. .
Sprinkle 2 to 3 tbsp of water and mix in. Add water as needed so there is no dry flour and the flour clumps up around all the broccoli and vegetables. Cover and cook for 3 or more minutes.
Garnish wiih cilantro and dash of lemon. Serve with dals as a side, or fill up tacos/rotis or serve over toast with slices radish or cucumber or as breakfast scramble.
