Ingredients:
1  large sweet potato
toppings of your choice ((you can find many suggestions above in the text) )

Instructions:
Vertically slice your sweet potatoes into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Don't make them too thick as they won't get cooked all through then.
You can either peel the sweet potatoes or just leave the skin on. I usually don't mind the skin, but that's totally up to you. It works both ways.
Turn the toaster all the way up to high and toast the sweet potato slices for 2-3 rounds or about 5 minutes. Spread the sweet potato toasts with the toppings of your choice. You can find many suggestions in the text above.
You can keep extra slices in an air-tight container in the fridge for up to one week. Just heat them up again in the toaster.
