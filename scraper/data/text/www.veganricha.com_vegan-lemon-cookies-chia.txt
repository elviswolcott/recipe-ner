Ingredients:
Zest of a lemon
2 tbsp lemon juice
2 tbsp non dairy yogurt ( or applesauce)
2 tbsp chia seeds
3 tbsp semi solid coconut oil
1/3 cup sugar (, unrefined raw or other)
1/4 cup almond flour (or use more flour)
1 cup flour ((unbleached all purpose or white whole wheat flour), see notes below for Glutenfree )
1 tsp baking powder
1/8 tsp salt
sugar and salt for coating

Instructions:
Add all the wet ingredients to a bowl and mix well until the sugar dissolves. Let it sit for a minute. (Donâ€™t wait for too long else chia seeds absorb all the moisture. )
Add flours and baking powder and salt and mix in until it is a soft dough. Add a good pinch of turmeric for color if you wish. If the dough is too sticky, add a tbsp more flour. If too dry, sprinkle in a few drops of water or oil and mix in. Smooth out the dough and Chill for 10-15 mins. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
Take small portions of the dough and roll into a ball. Mix 1 tbsp sugar and a good pinch of salt in a small bowl. Roll the ball in the sugar bowl, then press the ball to a flat cookie on a parchment lined baking sheet. Bake for 10 to 11 mins. Cool for 5 minutes and serve.
