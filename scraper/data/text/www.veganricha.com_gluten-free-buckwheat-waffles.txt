Ingredients:
1/2 cup buckwheat flour
3/4 cup oat flour
1.5 tsp baking powder
1 tbsp cornstarch  (or tapioca starch)
3 tbsp cocoa powder (a 1/2 to 1 tbsp more for more chocolately)
1/2 tsp cinnamon or spices of choice.
1/8 tsp salt
3-5 tbsp sugar
2 tsp oil
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 cup almond milk or oat milk
1/4 cup plus 2-3 tbsp carbonated water (,club soda, ginger ale, or something similar. From a fresh bottle.)

Instructions:
In a bowl, combine all the dry ingredients until well mixed.
Add in the oil, vanilla, almond milk, and  lightly mix.
Add in the 1/4 cup of club soda and mix. Add more one tbsp at a time until the mixture is a thick batter. Wait for 2 minutes to see if the consistency of the batter gets thinner by itself. If not, add another tbsp of the carbonated water and mix in.The batter will initially feel sludgy and less But will increase in volume and become light after 5 minutes.Â 
Heat your waffle iron, grease it a bit. Pour the thick sticky batter into the waffle iron to cook. These waffles rise a lot, so you&#039;ll want to use just a bit of batter and see how much of your waffle iron gets filled up when it rises.
Cook them until they are nice and crispy and done on all the edges and the center.
Remove the waffle from the waffle iron, and serve with a dollop of butter or whipped coconut cream, and a good drizzle of maple syrup.
