Ingredients:
3 lbs starchy potatoes  ((for example Russet or Yukon Gold))
1  onion, thinly sliced
2  cloves of garlic, minced
3/4 cup cashews ((unroasted and not salted))
2 cups unsweetened almond or soy milk
1/2 cup vegetable broth
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 cup nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
black pepper, to taste
1/2 - 3/4 cup vegan shredded cheese
chopped chives, to serve

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 375 F. Peel the potatoes and thinly slice them. Generously grease a baking dish with vegan butter or margarine. 
Now make the sauce. Combine all of the ingredients for the sauce in a high speed blender and blend until smooth. Spread about half of the potato slices into the bottom of the prepared baking dish.
Top with about half of the sauce. 
Cut the onion into thin slices. Heat some oil in a pan and sauté the onion for about 3 minutes. After 2 minutes add the garlic. Equally divide the onion and the garlic on the first layer of potatoes. 
Add a second layer of potatoes with the remaining potatoes. Top with the remaining sauce. 
Generously top with vegan shredded cheese. 
Bake for 50 minutes. Cover with aluminium foil towards the end of the baking time if the top gets too dark. Sprinkle with freshly chopped chives and serve immediately.
