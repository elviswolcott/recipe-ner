Ingredients:
2 cups pitted frozen cherries
3-4  soft medjool dates, pitted
2-3 tablespoons cocoa powder
3/4-1 cup cup almond milk

Instructions:
Add all ingredients to a high powered blender.&nbsp;Blend on high for a few minutes, using the tamper to push the ingredients down into the blades, until smooth. Use less dates if you want it less sweet, or more. Use just enough almond milk, using too much will make your ice cream runny.
Serve and enjoy!
