Ingredients:
1/2 cup warm water
1 Tablespoon raw sugar  (or 2 Tablespoons maple/agave)
1 Tablespoon active yeast
1/2 cup warm almond milk  (or other non dairy milk)
2 Tablespoons oil
3 cups organic bread flour (or all purpose flour or unbleached white flour (See notes section for 100% whole wheat bread))
1 1/4 teaspoon salt

Instructions:
In a bowl, proof the yeast by mixing warm water, sugar and yeast. Let sit for 5 minutes or until frothy.
In another bowl, add the dry ingredients and mix well.
Add the yeast mixture, oil and warm almond milk and knead for 8 minutes into a soft smooth non sticky dough.
Use more water or flour if needed. I added another Tablespoon water. It will depend on the consistency of the non dairy milk and if you used sugar or maple syrup.
Spray water on top.
Cover the bowl with a towel and let rise for 1.5 hours or until doubled.
Take the dough out, punch it down and shape into a loaf, by rolling into a jelly roll or pulling on all sides.
Place in a greased or parchment lined bread pan. Spray water on top and then spray oil or dust with flour.
Cover lightly with a towel and let rise until doubled. 30-40 minutes.
Bake in pre-heated 370 degrees F / 190Âºc for 35-40 minutes.
Remove the bread from pan. Cool completely before slicing.
