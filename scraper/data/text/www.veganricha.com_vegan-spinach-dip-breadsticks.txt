Ingredients:
1 tsp oil
1/2  onion (chopped)
6 cloves of garlic (finely chopped)
6 to 8 oz spinach (frozen or chopped)
1/2 cup corn (frozen)
1/4 tsp pepper flakes
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 cup cashews (soaked for 15 minutes)
1 1/3 cup non dairy milk or water
4 tsp tapioca starch
1 tbsp flour or  use rice flour to make it gluten-free
1 tsp lime or lemon juice
1 tsp apple cider vinegar or white vinegar
1 tsp extra virgin olive oil
1/2 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp miso or 1 tbsp nutritional yeast for cheesier flavor
a dash of black pepper
1 tbsp fresh dill or 1 tsp dried
1 tbsp chives or parsley or both or 1/2 tsp dried parsley
1  Recipe Easy Pizza crust  (or 2 puff pastry sheets.)

Instructions:
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and cook for 4 minutes, stirring occasionally until translucent.
Add spinach, corn and pepper flakes and mix in. Cook for 4 to 6 minutes. (I use frozen spinach directly from the freezer, fresh will cook faster).
Meanwhile, blend cashews with all the ingredients from non dairy milk to black pepper. Blend until smooth. (For thick and creamier dip, use 1/2 cup cashews and 1 tsp starch)
Add the mixture to the skillet. Sprinkle in the dill, chives/parsley and black pepper and mix in. Bring to a boil to thicken. Taste and adjust flavor. Cook for another minute stirring continuously then take off heat. At this point this dip can be served as is. Or transfer to a bread bowl and serve warm-hot with a sprinkle of vegan parm on top.
To make breadsticks, Prep your pizza crust and roll it out into somewhat rectangle or use thawed puff pastry sheets.  Spread the warm/cool (not hot) dip over the crust. Add jalapeno or other sliced veggies or veggie sausage or other toppings.
Bake at 425 degress F(220 deg C) for 17 minutes. Remove from the oven and let it sit for half a minute. Slice into breadsticks and serve!
