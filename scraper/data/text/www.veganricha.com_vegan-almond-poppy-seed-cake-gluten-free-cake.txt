Ingredients:
1/4 cup non dairy milk (or 2 tbsp non dairy milk + 2 tbsp non dairy yogurt)
2 tbsp flax seed meal
2 tbsp maple syrup
3 tbsp sugar (raw or other)
1 tsp vinegar (white or apple cider vinegar)
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/4 tsp almond extract (optional)
1 cup almond flour (I use Bob's Red Mill)
1/4 cup starch (I use 3 tbsp potato starch + 1 Tbsp tapioca/corn)
1/8 tsp salt
1 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
2 to 3 tsp poppy seeds

Instructions:
Prepare a 6 inch cake pan by greasing or lining with parchment.
In a bowl, mix the flax in the non dairy milk and let it sit for 5 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 deg F / 170c.
Add the maple, sugar, vanilla, vinegar. Add 1/4 tsp almond extract for stronger almond flavor or add lemon zest for lemon poppy seed cake. Mix well until sugar is mixed in.
In another bowl, mix the almond flour, starches, salt, baking powder and soda, poppy seeds. Break the almond flour lumps if there are any, with your hand or a spatula..
Add to the wet and mix well until smooth.* Transfer the batter to a greased 6 inch pan.
Bake at 350 degrees F / 170c for 30 minutes or until a toothpick from the center comes out clean.
Cool for 15 mins, then remove from the pan. Cool completely before slicing. Preferably refrigerate for 15 to 20 mins and then slice. Use an icing of choice. A simple lemon sugar icing works really well.
