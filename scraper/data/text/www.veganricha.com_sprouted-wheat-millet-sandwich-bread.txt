Ingredients:
1/4 cup wheat berries  (or other grains like spelt, or rye)
1/4 cup millet
3/4 cup water
2.25 cups bread flour  (or unbleached flour)
1.25 cups whole wheat flour
1.5 tsp salt
1/2 cup water
1 Tbsp active yeast
1 Tbsp sugar
1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1/4 cup non dairy yogurt  (or coconut milk)

Instructions:
Sprout the grains: Soak the wheat berries and millet in water overnight. Drain, wash and let sit in the bowl covered with a damp paper towel and a lid. Depending on the ambient temperature, it might take a day or more to sprout.
Blend the sprouted grains with 3/4 cup water 2 to 3 cycles so the grains break down and are not too large to inhibit gluten formation. (each blending cycle is a minute long)
Mix the salt into the bread + wheat flours and keep ready.
Mix the yeast and sugar in a 1/2 cup of warm water and let sit for 5 minutes or until frothy.
In a stand mixer or by hand, add the flours, yeast mixture, blended sprouted grains, warmed yogurt and oil and knead into a soft dough. Let sit for 1.5 hours. Punch down, use a Tbsp or so flour to shape into a loaf. Spray water on the loaf and sprinkle sesame seeds or oats. Cover with a towel and let rise until doubled. 40-45 mins.
Bake for 40-45 minutes at pre-heated 365 degrees F / 180c. Cool completely before slicing. Store refrigerated for upto a week. This Sandwich bread can be made into burger buns or dinner rolls as well and can be anywhere you use bread slices.
