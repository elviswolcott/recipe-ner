Ingredients:
1/2 cup rice flakes ((thick Poha))
3/4 cup old fashioned Oats
oil
1/2 tsp mustard seeds
3-4 tbsp onion (diced )
1/2 tsp chopped green chilies or chili flakes to taste (chopped )
nuts such as cashews/peanuts (chopped )
1/3 cup potatoes ((cooked/boiled and baked))
1/4 tsp turmeric powder
1/2 cup other veggies like small carrots, peas, zucchini ( chopped )
1 tbsp cilantro (chopped)
lemon juice

Instructions:
Soak the rice flakes and old fashioned Oats in hot water, for 5 mins( just enough water to cover all).
Or you can make this with only Oats. Add enough hot water to dampen them and let sit for 2 minutes. A bit of rice flakes in the mixture help the oats stay separate and not clump up)
Meanwhile, heat oil in a pan on medium heat. Spread oil to evenly coat pan.
Add the mustard seeds when the oil is hot. As soon as they start to sputter, add a few curry leaves and give it mix. Add 3-4 Tablespoons diced onion and chopped green chilies or chili flakes to taste. Cook until onions are translucent.
Add nuts and cook for half a minute. Add the chopped cooked(boiled/baked) potatoes and turmeric powder, mix and cook for a minute. If you don't have cooked potatoes, chop uncooked ones into smaller pieces, microwave them a minute at a time till almost cooked, and then add to pan, or you can skip potatoes.
Add other veggies like small chopped carrots, peas or zucchini. Mix and cook for 2 minutes.
Add soaked oats and rice flakes, salt and mix well. Cook covered on low-medium heat for 3-4 minutes. Open, mix well and cover and cook for another 2 minutes.
Sprinkle with fresh chopped cilantro and lemon juice and serve hot!
