Ingredients:
7-8  strawberries
1/2 cup blueberries
3-4  basil leaves or to taste (or 8-9 mint leaves)
2-3 cups of water
2 tablespoons raw sugar or jaggery or sweetener of choice (or no sweetener for a mildly sweet smoothie)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon rock salt ((kala namak or 1 Tablespoon lemon juice))
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon powder ((I usually use cumin, which goes very well with sour fruits))

Instructions:
In a deep pan, add the strawberries and blueberries, mint or basil leaves, salt, sugar, rock salt or lemon juice, cinnamon powder, and water enough to cover the fruit.
Boil for 10 minutes or till fruits soften.
Blend the mixture when cool and adjust salt, sugar and rock salt(rock salt adds a sour flavor).
Add more or less water according to preference. Keep it thick and smoothie like for a filling breakfast or add more water for a light drink.
Serve chilled topped with fresh mint leaves! Or add a splash of your favorite liquor in the evening!
