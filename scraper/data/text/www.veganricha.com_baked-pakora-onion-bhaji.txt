Ingredients:
2 cups thinly sliced onion (red onion works best, separated out so that they don't clump together)
1/3 cup chickpea flour (, plus 1 tbsp if needed, if using besan, you will need 2-3 tbsp more )
2 tablespoons rice flour
1/2 teaspoon minced ginger
1-2  green chilies (finely chopped)
1/2 teaspoon turmeric
1/4 teaspoon Cayenne or Indian red chili powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
Generous pinch  baking soda
1 tablespoon oil
2 to 3 tablespoons water

Instructions:
Add onions to a large bowl and separate.
Add in all the spices, salt, chickpea flour and rice flour and baking soda .
Sprinkle in the oil and mix in.
Let the mixture sit for 5-10 minutes. The onion will leak some moisture and that will help you determine how much moisture you need.
Add in water, just a little bit at a time so that you get a pasty pakora mix. It&#039;s not going to be a bowl of batter, it&#039;s going to be like onion rings with the onions covered with a layer of batter. If you like more coverage, add in 1-2 tbsp more chickpea flour and a sprinkle in water.
Take spoonfuls of this mixture and place on a parchment lined baking sheet. You want to make small to medium sized pakoras and not too huge so that there aren’t too many thick clumps of onion. Then bake at 400 degrees F (205 C) for 20 to 25 minutes. You want to keep an eye on them and check after about 17-18 minutes to see that they&#039;re baking ok and not burning. Move the sheet around at that time that you check and then continue to bake. You can also brush some oil on the pakoras after the 18 minute mark.
Once the pakoras are cooked, let them cool for a few minutes. You can serve onion bhaji with ketchup, vegan cucumber raita, mint chutney  coconut chutney, tamarind chutney
