Ingredients:
1  Puff pastry sheet (defrosted)
1 recipe Macadamia nut cheese ((see notes))
1/2 cup Quince paste

Instructions:
Heat the oven to 400F.
Unfold the puff pastry sheet on a lightly floured surface.&nbsp;
Roll out the puff pastry to a square twice the size of the cheese.&nbsp;
Cut of the corners to make a sort of circle.&nbsp;
Place the quince paste in the center of the sheet, then place the cheese on top.&nbsp;
Brush the edge of the circle with water.
Fold the top and bottom sides over the cheese and trim edges
Press the side edges over the center of the cheese and press to seal.
Flip the wrapped cheese so it is seam-side down on the baking sheet.&nbsp;
Decorate with the pastry scraps, if desired. ( I did a flower)
Brush with water
Bake for 20 â€“ 30 minutes or until golden brown. Let rest for 10 minutes before serving. &nbsp;
