Ingredients:
12  mint leaves
a good pinch of salt

1.5 cups or more ice cubes

Instructions:
Distribute the mint leaves in 2 to 3 cocktail glasses.
Add a 1/4 tsp sugar, a pinch of salt and a thin slice of lime to each. Muddle the mixture to bruise the mint leaves. (use a wooden flat bottom muddler/stick or a pestle or back end of a spatula or use a spoon).
Distribute the juice of a lime in the glasses. Fill the glasses with ice cubes.
Add mango puree, rum and water. Add more sugar if desired.
Garnish with mint leaves or lime slices and serve.
