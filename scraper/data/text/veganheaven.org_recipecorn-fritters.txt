Ingredients:
3 cups corn ((either canned or frozen))
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons corn meal
2  flax eggs ((2 tablespoons of ground flaxseed meal plus 6 tablespoons of water))
1 teaspoon salt
cayenne pepper, to taste
3/4 cup finely diced red and green bell peppers
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon regular paprika powder
1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika powder
3/4 cup unsweetened almond milk
1/2 teaspoon cumin
2  green onions, chopped
4 tablespoons vegan mayonnaise
2 tablespoons vegan sour cream
1 teaspoon paprika powder
1 teaspoon tomato paste
1 pinch of  salt
tabasco sauce, to taste

Instructions:
Make the flax egg: Combine two tablespoons of ground flaxseed meal with six tablespoons of water. Let it sit on the counter until you&#x27;re done with the rest of the ingredients. It will thicken up during this time.
Finely dice the bell peppers. Set aside. 
In a large bowl, combine all of the ingredients for the fritters and stir until well combined. Make sure not to overmix the batter. 
In a large frying pan, heat some oil. Place a scoop of the corn fritter batter (about a 1/4 cup)  into the hot oil.  Cook the fritters for 3 minutes, then carefully flip them. Cook them an additional 3 minutes until they’re golden brown and cooked through.  
Transfer the fritters to a plate lined with paper towel and repeat the cooking process with the remaining batter.
While the fritters are cooking, make the spicy mayonnaise dip. Combine all of the ingredients in a bowl and stir until well combined. 
Serve the fritters with the spicy mayonnaise and garnish with chopped green onions.
