Ingredients:
3/4 cup water
1.5-2 tsps favorite good quality tea (we use loose leaf tea like Jivraj)
1.5 Tbsps raw Sugar or to taste or use any other sweetener of choice
1/2 tsp Chai spice blend
1-2 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
1.5-3 Tablespoons non dairy creamer (We use plain SoDelicious Coconut milk creamer.)
1/2 cup almond milk

Instructions:
Mix the following and bring to a boil on medium heat; water, tea, sugar, chai spice, ginger
Once it comes to a boil, reduce to a low simmer.
Add a few drops of cold or room temp water to reduce the temperature of the boiling water, then add 1.5-3 Tablespoons non dairy creamer(We use plain SoDelicious Coconut milk creamer).
Then add 1/2 cup almond milk. Let the tea get heated on low to a temperature that you like your tea at, then take off heat(We usually keep it on low for about 2 minutes).
Do not boil ! The almond milk consistency and taste changes a bit at high heat.
Strain and Serve immediately.
