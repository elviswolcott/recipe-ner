Ingredients:
4.4 oz brown rice
3  large zucchini
2 tablespoons olive oil
one block smoked tofu (7 oz), cut into cubes
1  onion, chopped
1  clove of garlic, minced
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 cup kidney beans
1 cup corn
1/2 cup water
1 teaspoon paprika powder
1 teaspoon oregano
1 teaspoon basil
1/2 teaspoon cumin
red pepper flakes
1 pinch salt
1 pinch black pepper
1/2 cup cashews, soaked for 30 minutes
1  clove of garlic
1/2  cup unsweetened almond milk (If necessary add more water.)
1 tablespoon nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon paprika powder
1/2 teaspoon white miso paste (optional)
salt
black pepper

Instructions:
Cook the rice according to the instructions on the package.
Cut the zucchini lengthwise into halves and scoop out the insides of the zucchini halves with a small spoon. Grease them with olive oil (one tablespoon).
In a medium pan, heat about one tablespoon of olive oil and stir-fry the tofu cubes for about 4 minutes until they're golden and crispy. Add the onions and sautée for 3 more minutes until translucent. Then add the garlic and sautée for another minute.
Stir in the cooked rice, the tomato paste, and the water. Add the kidney beans, the corn, and the spices.
Line a baking tray with parchment paper and put the zucchini shells on top. Fill the Mexican rice into the zucchini shells.
Then make the cashew cheese: Drain the cashews and place them into a food processor together with the rest of the ingredients. Process until smooth.
Put the cheese sauce on top of the stuffed zucchini and bake them at 350 F for 20 minutes.&nbsp;
