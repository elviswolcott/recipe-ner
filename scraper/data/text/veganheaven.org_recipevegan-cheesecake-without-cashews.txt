Ingredients:
2 cups + 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 cup plant-based margarine (It should be soft, so put it out of the fridge about 1 hour before using.)
1/4 cup agave
1 1/2 tablespoons baking powder
2 tablespoons water
35 oz vanilla soy yogurt ((1 kg) )
2 bags vanilla pudding powder or custard powder (make sure it's vegan) ((2.8 oz or 80 g in total))
1/2 cup melted margarine
1/4 cup agave
1/2 cup  pureed raspberries
fresh raspberries
fresh mint leaves

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 Â°F. Prepare the crust: Combine all ingredients in a mixing bowl and use your hands to knead it into a soft dough.
Rub the pan with margarine all over the bottom and sides of the pan.
Press the dough into the bottom and up the sides of the pan, making a thicker layer on the bottom than on the sides.
In a large mixing bowl combine all the ingredients for the cheesecake filling. Beat with a hand-held electric mixer until well combined.
Pour in the filling and bake for about 1 hour. Don't worry if the filling is still soft and a bit runny. It will harden once the cake has cooled down. Let it cool down for an hour. Then place it in the fridge for at least 4 hours.
Top it with the raspberry sauce, some fresh raspberries, and some mint leaves. Enjoy!
