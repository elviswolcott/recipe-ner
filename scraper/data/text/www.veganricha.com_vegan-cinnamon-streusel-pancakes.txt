Ingredients:
1 cup flour ((I use all purpose for soft pancakes), see Notes for glutenfree)
1.75 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
1 tsp cinnamon
3 tbsp sugar
1 cup non dairy milk
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 tsp vinegar
1 tbsp oil
2 tbsp flour
2 tbsp brown sugar
1/4 tsp salt
1 tsp cinnamon
1 tbsp oil or melted vegan butter

Instructions:
In a bowl, whisk the dry ingredients for pancakes until well combined.
In another small bowl, mix 3/4 cup non dairy milk, vanilla and vinegar. Add to the dry. Add oil and mix. Add more milk 2 tbsp at a time. Depending on the flours you will need 2 to 6 tbsp more. Whisk to make a pancake batter that is not too stiff and also not too thin.&nbsp;
Mix the flour, sugar,salt and cinnamon for the streusel in a bowl. Add oil and mix to make a crumbly mixture.
Heat a skillet over medium heat. Brush oil. If making regular pancakes: Pour batter on the hot skillet. Top with some streusel. Cover the pan and cook for 3 to 4 mins. Then flip and cook for another 2 mins.
If making cookie cutter pancakes,&nbsp;Once the skillet is hot, place the cookie cutters on the skillet. Spray oil on the cutter. Pour pancake batter to reach a 1/3 to 1/2 of the height of the cookie cutter. Then sprinkle streusel. Cover the pan with a lid and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook for 5 to 7 minutes, then flip the pancake with the cookie cutter and cook for 2 mins. Remove from pan. Let cool for a minute then&nbsp; carefully loosen the cookie cutter.
Drizzle with maple, icing or top with some cream cheese frosting or whipped coconut cream and fruits!
