1 Tablespoon active yeast
1 Tablespoon raw sugar (coconut sugar)

1/4 cup Spelt or Wheat flour
1/4 cup Rye flour
1/4 cup Kamut flour
1/4 cup Sorghum flour
2 Tablespoons Barley flour
1 Tablespoon vital wheat gluten
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 Tablespoon Extra Virgin Olive oil (Use 2 Tablespoons non dairy yogurt to make Oil free)
Variations: To make sweeter version (add 3 Tablespoons more raw sugar and spices of choice like cinnamon, chai spice.)

Instructions:
In a bowl, add warm water, yeast and sugar. Mix well and let sit for 10 minutes or until frothy.
(To make sugar free, add a Tablespoon of bread flour to the water. Add pureed date, maple, stevia or other sweetener of choice when you add the flours, so the bread is not bland.)
Add all the flours, salt, wheat gluten and oil/yogurt.
Mix with a spoon until well combined, then knead for 2-3 minutes. Use more bread flour if needed to make a soft, not too sticky dough.
Or add everything to stand mixer and knead at bread dough speed for 5-6 minutes.
Spray water on top, cover with towel and let sit for 1.5 hours or until doubled.
Using 2 or more Tablespoons bread flour on your hand and on the dough, punch it down and knead for half a minute.
Divide into 6-7 equal portions and roll into balls.
You can shape by making small rectangles of the divided dough and rolling them up like jelly roll, or pulling on all sides and tucking under. Place seam side down.
Place balls half an inch away from each other on parchment lined baking sheet.
Spray water on top.
Sprinkle Sesame seeds or other seeds of choice on top.
