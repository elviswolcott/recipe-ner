Ingredients:
8 oz green asparagus
1/2 tablespoon olive oil
1  small onion, finely chopped
4 cups mushrooms, sliced
2  cloves of garlic, miced
1 cup risotto rice
3/4 cup white wine
1 3/4 cup  asparagus broth (the water you cooked the asparagus in)
1 1/2 cup vegetable broth
10-15  cherry tomatoes, cut into halves
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
1 tablespoon chopped parsley
1 teaspoon white miso paste
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste
2 tablespoons soy cuisine/ vegan cream (optional)

Instructions:
Cut the asparagus into 2-inch-long pieces. Bring a large pot of salted water to boil and cook the asparagus for about 6-8 minutes depending on their size. When draining the asparagus, keep 1 3/4 cups of the water you cooked it in, as you will need it later on.
In a large pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté for about 3 minutes, until it's translucent. Stir in the mushrooms and the garlic and stir-fry for another 3 minutes. Then add the rice and sauté for 2 more minutes.
Deglaze with white wine and allow the wine to evaporate. Once the wine has cooked into the rice, add half of the asparagus broth. Turn down the heat to a simmer and slowly keep adding the rest of the asparagus broth and the vegetable broth, allowing each amount to be absorbed before you add the next. This will take about 15-20 minutes, depending on the rice you use. If needed add more vegetable broth.
Stir in the asparagus, the cherry tomatoes, the nutritional yeast, the white miso paste and (if using) the vegan soy cream.
Cook for a few more minutes, or until heated through. If necessary add more vegetable broth.
Season with salt and pepper and sprinkle with chopped parsley.
