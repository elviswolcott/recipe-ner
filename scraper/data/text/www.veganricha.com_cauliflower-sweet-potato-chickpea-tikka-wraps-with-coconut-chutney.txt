Spread the vegetables and chickpeas on a large parchment lined baking sheet. Drizzle any &nbsp;remaining marinade over the veggies lightly. Bake at 425 deg F for 25 to 30 mins.
Let the veggies cool for 2 minutes, then carefully remove from sheet and place in warm tortillas or in a bowl. Add some crunchy greens, lettuce if desired. Add a generous drizzle of the coconut chutney or use other chutneys like Mint Cilantro Chutney
