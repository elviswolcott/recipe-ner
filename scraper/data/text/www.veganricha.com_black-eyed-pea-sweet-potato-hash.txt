Ingredients:
1 tsp oil
1/2  medium onion (chopped)
3 cloves of garlic (finely chopped)
1  sweet potato (peeled and cubed small (1.5 to 2 cups cubed))
1/2  green bell pepper (chopped small)
1/2 tsp or more salt (depends on if the black eyed peas are salted)
1/2 tsp thyme
1 tsp harissa spice blend  (or 2 to 3 tsp paste)
1.5 cups cooked black eyed peas

1/4 to 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
1 tsp olive oil
ground cumin (black pepper, or more harissa spice blend for garnish)
cilantro/scallions and lemon juice for garnish

Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat, Add onion and garlic and a pinch of salt and cook until translucent. 5 to 6 minutes. Stir occasionally.

Add a splash of water (2 to 3 tbsp) and mix. Cover and cook for 8 to 10 minutes undisturbed. Stir and check if the sweet potatoes are done. Cover and cook for 2 minutes or so longer if not done.
