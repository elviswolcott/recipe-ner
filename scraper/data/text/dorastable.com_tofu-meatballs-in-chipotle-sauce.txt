Ingredients:
½ lb. Tofu (extra-firm, drained)
2 cups Cremini mushrooms, stems removed ((6 oz.) )
½  Onion (grated, squeeze excess liquid out)
1 clove Garlic (minced)
1 ¼ cups Panko breadcrumbs
2 tbsp. Almond milk (unsweetened)
2 tbsp. Soy sauce
1 tsp. Vegan Worcestershire
1 tbsp. Flaxseed (ground)
5  Roma tomates (large, chopped)
½  Onion (chopped)
2  Garlic cloves (peeled)
1 - 2  Chipotle chiles in adobo
½ cup Vegetable stock or water
¼ cup Cilantro (chopped)

Instructions:
Preheat oven to 375°F.
Press tofu between two plates and place a couple of cans on top to drain excess liquid for 20 minutes.
In the meantime chop the mushrooms very finely and place in a large bowl.
Add the garlic, onion, breadcrumbs, almond milk, soy sauce, vegan Worcestershire, and flaxseed to the bowl.
Use your hands to crumble the pressed tofu into the bowl, season with salt and pepper, and mix well.
Roll the mixture into 15- 18 balls and place on a sheet tray covered with parchment paper. (You can add a little bit of oil on the parchment paper so the meatballs don’t stick, but this is optional if you are oil-free.)
Bake for 30 minutes, turning them halfway through.
