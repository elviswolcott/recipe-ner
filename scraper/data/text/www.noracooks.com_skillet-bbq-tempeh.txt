Ingredients:
2 (8-oz) packages tempeh
1 cup water
2-3 tablespoons olive oil
18 oz barbecue sauce (*I used Trader Joe&#x27;s Kansas City Style)
1 Recipe Vegan Mashed Potatoes
1 Recipe Roasted Brussels Sprouts

Instructions:
Remove the tempeh from packaging and cut into cubes.
Place in a large skillet and add about 1 cup of water, so the tempeh is about half covered. Cover and cook on high heat, steaming the tempeh for about 5 minutes until nearly all of the water has evaporated. Watch closely so it doesn&#x27;t burn. Steaming the tempeh takes away any bitter flavors.
Once the water is nearly evaporated, turn the heat down to medium add 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil. Fry the tempeh in the oil for a few minutes, stirring frequently, until golden.
Now add the entire jar of barbecue sauce and stir to coat. If the tempeh sticks to the pan, use a quality spatula to carefully scrape the pieces off the bottom.
Serve immediately with mashed potatoes and brussels sprouts, rice, or in a sandwich or wrap. Enjoy!
