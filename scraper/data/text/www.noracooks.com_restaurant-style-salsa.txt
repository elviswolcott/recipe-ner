Ingredients:
(2) 14 ounce cans diced fire roasted tomatoes* (see Note)
2 cloves garlic
3/4 cup red onion, roughly chopped
1/2 cup packed cilantro
1-2  fresh jalapenos, seeds removed and roughly chopped
3 tablespoons fresh lime juice, from about 2 small limes
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste

Instructions:
Add all ingredients to a blender (food processor would work as well). Pulse and blend a few times or until you reach desired consistency. It won't take long, maybe 30 seconds to 1 minute.
Taste the salsa, and based on your personal preference, adjust ingredients as necessary. Add more salt, cilantro, or perhaps more jalapeno if desired.
Transfer to an airtight container and store in the fridge until serving. Serve with tortilla chips, in burritos, Mexican bowls or anywhere else you enjoy salsa.
