Ingredients:
9 oz whole wheat penne
1 tablespoon olive oil
1  small onion, chopped
3 cups  pumpkin (about 17 oz), cut into cubes
2  cloves of garlic, minced
1/2 cup white wine (I used Chardonnay)
1/2 cup vegetable broth
1 cup cherry tomatoes, cut into halves
about 30  basil leaves, cut into stripes
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste
2 tablespoons pumpkin seeds

Instructions:
Cook the whole wheat penne according to the instructions on the package. Set aside.
I a large pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Sauté the onion for about one minute. Then add the pumpkin cubes and cook for 6 minutes. Add the minced garlic and sauté for another minute. Then deglaze with white wine and vegetable broth and allow it to evaporate. This will take about 10 minutes.
Add the cherry tomatoes and simmer for 2 minutes. Then stir in the cooked penne and the basil leaves. Season with salt and pepper and cook until the pasta is heated through. Sprinkle with pumpkin seeds.
