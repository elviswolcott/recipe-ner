Ingredients:
1  head of cauliflower (mine was small-medium-ish size)
1 cup water
3/4 cup + 2 Tbsp flour ((I used half whole wheat + half white , (use 1/2 cup chickpea flour + 1/4 cup or more rice flour to make gf))
3/4 to 1 tsp salt  (or to taste)
1 tsp each of garlic powder and onion powder
1/2 tsp each of smoked paprika, chili powder/cayenne
a very generous dash of black pepper
2 tsp oil (optional)
1 cup mango jam or preserves (or use orange marmalade or grape jelly for variations)
1/4 cup Sriracha sauce  (or to taste :))
1 Tbsp or more hot sauce or to taste (I used Frank's red hot)
1/4 cup Orange juice or apple juice (more juice if you like a thinner glaze)
a generous pinch of garlic powder
1/4 tsp ginger powder

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F / 230c. Chop the cauliflower into 1.5-2 inch pieces. Mix everything under batter in a bowl until smooth and thick enough batter that can coat the cauliflower pieces well.(add more flour if needed). Dip cauliflower in the batter and place on parchment lined baking sheet. Line the sheet with parchment or grease very well. Bake for 20 minutes.
