Ingredients:
1/3 cup uncooked brown lentils (sabut masoor)
1 tsp oil
4 cloves of garlic (minced)
1 inch ginger (minced)
1  hot green chile (chopped)
2  large tomatoes (chopped)
1/2 tsp garam masala
1/4 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp cardamom
1/2 tsp turmeric
2  medium potatoes (cubed)
1/2 tsp salt
1 cup water
5 to 6 oz Spinach or a combination of greens.

Instructions:
Soak the lentils for at least an hour else they will not cook within the time and the potatoes will get over cooked in the more time needed to cook lentils.
In saute mode over medium, add oil, ginger, garlic, chile and cook until translucent. Add tomato and spices and cook until tomatoes are tender. Mash the larger pieces. 4 to 5 minutes.
Add the potatoes, drained lentils, water, salt and mix in. Add in the spinach or greens and mix in. Close the lid and cook on Manual (high pressure) for 7 to 8 minutes. Let the pressure release naturally.
Open, taste and adjust salt and spice. Add more spices or garam masala if needed. Garnish with cilantro, pepper flakes and lemon and serve over rice or with roti/flatbread.
