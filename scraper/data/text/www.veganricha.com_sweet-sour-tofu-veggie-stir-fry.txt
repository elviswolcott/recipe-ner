Ingredients:
14 oz  extra firm (or firm tofu, pressed for 15 minutes, then cubed)
2 tsp soy sauce
1 tsp oil (or use sesame oil)
2 tbsp cornstarch
1 tsp rice flour
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp oil
1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
1/2 cup sliced red or white onion (sliced into 3/4-1 inch pieces)
1 cup sliced red bell pepper (sliced into 3/4-1 inch pieces)
1/2 cup sliced green bell pepper (also sliced into 3/4-1 inch pieces)
1/2 cup chopped celery
3 cloves minced garlic
4 tbsp apple cider vinegar
1/4 cup maple syrup
1-2 tbsp sugar (optional, add if you like your sauce to be sweeter)
2 tbsp soy sauce
2 tbsp ketchup
1 tsp cornstarch mixed in 1/2 cup of water

Instructions:
Add the pressed and cubed tofu to a bowl, add in the soy sauce and oil and mix well, and let it sit for a minute, then add in the corn starch, rice flour, and garlic powder, and toss well to coat. You can bake this tofu or pan fry it.
To bake, transfer the tofu to a parchment lined baking sheet, and bake at 400 degrees F (200c) for 20-25 minutes.
To pan fry, transfer this tofu to a skillet over medium high heat, add in 2 tsp oil, and add in the tofu, and cook until crisp and golden on most of the edges, then set aside.
