Ingredients:
1/2 cup Oats
1/2 cup brown rice krispies
1/4 cup Almond slivers
1/4 cup chopped Walnuts
1/4 cup cranberries
1/4 cup raisins/dried blueberries/goji berries
1/4 cup Watermelon Seeds (Magaj or sunflower seeds)
2 Tablespoons sesame seeds
1/4 teaspoon spices of choice (I added a pinch of cinnamon and ginger)
a few drops of stevia or a Tablespoon of raw sugar powdered (optional, for sweeter)
a generous pinch of salt
1 Tablespoon Agave syrup
1 teaspoon virgin coconut oil (melted)
1/3 cup berry puree
1/4 cup Oats flour
Berry Puree as needed (1/4+ cup)

Instructions:
Puree a cup of berries of choice, without water and keep aside. I used Blueberries and Strawberries.
In a large bowl, add all the dry ingredients and mix for a few seconds.
In a saucepan, heat 1/3 cup berry puree and combine coconut oil, agave, sugar and salt.
Heat till just about a boil.
Add this to the dry. Mix well. Add more berry puree if needed.(It depends on the berries and the moisture content.)
Spread the mixture on parchment lined tray.
Bake in preheated 350 degrees F for 10 minutes.
Mix it up bit, rotate the baking tray, and bake for another 5 minutes.
Remove from oven, and press lightly with spatula to get the granola to stick.
Cool completely before storing.
