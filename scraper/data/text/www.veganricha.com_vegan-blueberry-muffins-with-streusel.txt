Ingredients:
1 cup non dairy milk (, such as almond or soy or lite coconut milk)
3 tbsp non dairy yogurt,  or use 2 tbsp applesauce or non dairy milk
1 tsp apple cider vinegar or other vinegar
1/3 cup unrefined sugar (, use 1 tbsp more for sweeter)
1/4 cup oil (neutral such as organic safflower or canola   (, see note for oilfree)
1 tsp vanilla extract
a few drops of almond extract (, optional but wonderful)
2 cups of flour ((I use a mix of unbleached all purpose (1.25 cup) and wheat (3/4 cup)))
2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
Zest of a lime
2 cups fresh blueberries
1/4 cup flour
1/4 cup coconut sugar or brown sugar
2 tbsp vegan butter (softened, or oil)

Instructions:
Line a muffin pan. Preheat the oven to 400 deg F (204 deg C). In a bowl, mix in the wet ingredients until the sugar is fully combined.Â In another bowl, whisk 1 3/4 cup flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Add spices of choice if you like. See GF option in Notes below. (Optional: Add 2 tbsp almond flour to the dry for additional texture).
Fold the dry into the wet until just about combined. Add more flour if needed 1 tbsp at a time to make just slightly thick batter (you might not need any depending on the flours used).
Add lime zest. Add 1 tbsp flour to the blueberries and toss lightly then add to the batter. Drop spoonfuls of the batter into the lined muffin pan, not more than 2/3 full.
Make the streusel: Mix the flour and sugar in a bowl. Add the vegan butter/ oil and mix in to make fat crumbs
Sprinkle generous streusel on the batter. Bake at 400 deg F (204 C) for 16 mins, reduce temp to 375 (190 C) and bake for another 7 to 8 mins.
Cool for 10 mins, then remove from the pan, Cool completely and store on the counter for the day or refrigerated for upto 4 days, Freeze for upto a month.
