Ingredients:
1  8 oz package tempeh (thinly sliced)
3 to 4 tbsp bbq sauce
1 tbsp ketchup
2 tbsp or more sriracha or other spicy chili sauce
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp oil
2 tbsp water
1 cup or more chopped cabbage
1/2 cup chopped or grated carrots
1/4 cup chopped or grated apples or other crunchy fruit or veggie
2 tablespoons tahini
2 tablespoons water
1 teaspoon dijon mustard
2 tsp or more maple syrup
1/2 to 1 tsp lemon juice
1/4 tsp cumin powder
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
chopped juicy fruit like mango or watermelon
cilantro
avocado
flat breads

Instructions:
1. Mix all the ingredients except tempeh in a shallow bowl. Add tempeh strips and mix and flip to coat. Let them sit for 15 minutes to an hour refrigerated. Longer the better. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the Tempeh strips, 1/2 inch away from each other, in a shallow parchment lined baking sheet or pan. Brush any leftover sauce on the strips. Bake at for 18 to 22 minutes or until the center strips are dry to touch. Cool for a few minutes before removing from the sheet.
2. In a bowl mix the tahini, water, mustard, maple, and lemon juice. Taste and adjust sweet and tang. Add cabbage, carrots and apples and mix well. Add salt and black pepper to taste. Add sesame seeds for crunch (optional).
3. Warm the flatbread, add a good helping of the slaw and warm tempeh strips. Garnish with cilantro, fruits or avocado, serve.
