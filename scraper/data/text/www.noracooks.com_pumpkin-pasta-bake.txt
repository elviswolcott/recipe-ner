Ingredients:
12 ounces rotini pasta (*gluten free if needed)
1 Recipe Vegan Ricotta
1-2 tablespoons olive oil
1 small onion, diced
2-3 cloves garlic, minced
15 ounce can pumpkin puree
13.5 ounce can full fat coconut milk
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon salt
few shakes black pepper
2 cups baby spinach, sliced into ribbons
1 bag vegan mozzarella cheese shreds  (*I used Violife)

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly spray a large casserole dish with oil.
Cook pasta according to package instructions, then drain and set aside.
Prepare the Vegan Ricotta, and set aside.
Make the pumpkin sauce: Warm a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the olive oil, onion and garlic and saut√© for 3-4 minutes until translucent. Stir in the pumpkin, coconut milk, nutmeg, salt and pepper. Remove from heat.
To the prepared casserole dish, add the pasta and pumpkin cream sauce. Stir to mix well, then stir in the spinach.
Add spoonfuls of the vegan ricotta to the dish, and mix slightly but leave chunks of cheese intact. Cover with vegan mozzarella, if using, and bake for 15-20 minutes until warm and the cheese has melted. Serve and enjoy!
