Ingredients:
2 cups 8 oz rotini pasta  ((*use gluten-free pasta))
 cup mushrooms, chopped small
 cup shredded carrots
 cup minced eggplant
2 cups 18 oz vegan marinara sauce or Mushroom Red Pepper Pasta Sauce (page 85)
2 cups plain nondairy milk, unsweetened
1 tablespoon 15 ml vodka (optional)
2 teaspoons tomato paste
2 teaspoons nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon basil
 teaspoon oregano
 teaspoon pepper flakes
 teaspoon onion powder
Salt (to taste)

Instructions:
Add everything but the salt to a deep skillet and push the pasta underneath the liquid. Bring to a boil, then turn the heat down to medium-low and simmer until the pasta is al dente, about 10 minutes.
Stir every few minutes so everything doesnâ€™t stick to the bottom of the pan. Cook for about 9 minutes or until the pasta is tender. The timing will vary depending on the shape and kind of pasta you use. Taste and add salt if needed.
