Ingredients:
2  cups Whole wheat flour
 cup Wheat bran
 cup Oat flour
1 tbsp. Active dry yeast (1 pkg)
1 tsp. Salt (kosher)
1 tbsp. Oil (canola)
1/8 cup Honey
1  cups Water (warm)

Instructions:
In a large bowl combine the oil, active dry yeast, water, and honey. Stir and set aside for 5 to 6 minutes or until the mixture bubbles and foams.
Spray 1- 85 loaf pan with cooking spray.
In a medium bowl combine the flours and the salt. Add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients 1 cup at a time, mixing with a wooden spoon until all flour is incorporated.
Turn the dough out into a lightly floured surface and knead for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and elastic. To test if the dough, insert your thumb into the dough for 5 seconds. If your thumb comes out clean the dough is ready.
Preheat oven to 350F. Shape the dough into a loaf and place in the pan. Cover with a dish towel and let rise until it doubles in size, for about 1 hour.
Bake bread on the center rack of the oven for about 40 min. or until the crust is golden brown and the bread sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.
Cool completely on a rack before slicing.
