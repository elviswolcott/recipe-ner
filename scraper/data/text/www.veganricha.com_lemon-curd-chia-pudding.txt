Ingredients:
Zest of a large lemon (or 2 small lemons)
Juice of 2 large lemons
13.5 or 15 oz can full fat coconut milk (about 1.5 cups)
1/4 cup water (optional)
3 tbsp or more sweetener (I use raw sugar)
a good pinch of salt
1/4 tsp or more turmeric
3 tbsp or more chia seeds (5 to 6 tbsp for well set pudding)

Instructions:
Blend the lemon zest, juice, coconut milk, water, sweetener, salt and turmeric until well combined. Add chia seeds and pulse once or twice to distribute the chia seeds well.
Taste and adjust sweet and tang. Add more lemon juice or zest to taste and mix/blend in.
Pour the mixture into glasses. Chill overnight in the refrigerator. Stir once after an hour or so to distribute the chia seeds if needed.
Garnish with whipped coconut cream and lemon zest and serve.
