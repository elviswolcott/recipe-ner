Ingredients:
21 oz very firm tofu
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup unsweetened almond or soy milk
1/4 cup water
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons paprika powder
1 cup panko bread crumbs
1 cup Frank&#x27;s Red Hot Buffalo Wings sauce
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 cup vegan mayonnaise
1 teaspoon dried or freshly chopped dill
1 teaspoon dried or freshly chopped parsley
black pepper, to taste

Instructions:
Drain the tofu and pat it dry with a paper towel. Cut it into sticks. 
In a large bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, the plant-based milk, the water, the garlic power, the paprika powder, the salt, and the black pepper. Stir until well combined.
Dip the tofu sticks into the batter, so they’re completely coated.
Then roll them in the panko breadcrumbs.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and lay the tofu fingers on the baking sheet. Don’t put them on top of each other. Bake for 25 minutes at 350 °F.
Combine Frank’s Red Hot Buffalo Wings sauce with a tablespoon of olive oil and pour it over the baked tofu fingers. Evenly coat them from all sides by carefully stirring them a few times.
Put the coated sticks back on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake again for 20 minutes at 350 °F.
For the vegan ranch dip, combine the vegan mayonnaise with fresh or dried dill and parsley and stir until well combined. Serve the freshly baked vegan tofu sticks with the vegan ranch and enjoy! Also sprinkle some chopped green onions and freshly chopped parsley on top if you want.
