Ingredients:
1/2 cup sundried tomato (,dry pack, not packed in olive oil)
1/2 cup almond flour
1 tsp dried basil
1/2 tsp oregano
1/2 tsp pepper flakes
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp garlic powder
1/8 tsp onion powder
2-3 tsp nutritional yeast
1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil (, see note for oilfree)

Instructions:
Add the sundried tomato and almond flour to a food processor and process until the sundried tomatoes are a coarse meal.
Add the rest of dry ingredients and pulse a few times to combine.
The mixture should now be like well moistened crumbs that should hold together when you press them. If not add a bit more olive oil. If too crumbly (if using almond meal) you might need to add a tsp or so regular flour. **Transfer the mix to a bowl and refrigerate for 15 minutes. Remove the bowl from the refrigerator and press and roll into balls. Place the balls on parchment baking sheet and bake at 300F(150 c) for 12 minutes.
After baking, let them cool completely and store in the refrigerator up to 2 weeks.
