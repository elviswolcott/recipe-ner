Ingredients:
1/2  red onion (chopped)
1 cup packed cilantro
1  green chili
1/2 inch knob of ginger
3-4 cloves of garlic
1/4 tsp fennel seeds
1/4 tsp cumin seeds
3-4  black peppercorns
a generous pinch of cinnamon powder (cardamom powder, cloves powder)
1/2 tsp garam masala
1 tsp oil
1/2  head of cauliflower  (or 1.5-2 cups grated)
1/2 cup frozen green peas
1  red bell pepper sliced thin
1/2 tsp salt or to taste
1/2 tsp lemon juice or vinegar
1/2 cup water or non dairy milk
a generous dash of cayenne or chili powder

Instructions:
Blend the onion, cilantro, chili, garlic, ginger, spices into a smooth puree(use 1/2 cup or more water). In a pan, add a teaspoon of oil and heat on medium heat. Add the puree and cook uncovered for 15-18 minutes or until it gets dry and clumpy. Reduce heat to low-medium after 10 minutes. Stir occasionally to avoid burning.
Meanwhile, chop up the cauliflower and rice(chop) it in a blender or food processor or grate. Slice the red bell peppers and other veggies if adding.
Add the grated cauliflower and red bell pepper to the dry onion cilantro curry. Mix well to evenly distribute and cook for 2 minutes on medium heat. Add peas and a 1/2 cup of water(add almond milk for creamier version), lemon juice and salt. Cover and cook for 6-8 minutes. Mix and adjust salt and spice/cayenne. Cook uncovered to dry the curry a bit to preference or until the cauliflower is tender to preference. 3-5 minutes. Serve hot with Naan/flatbread or rice or grains or fill up tacos or lettuce leaves.
