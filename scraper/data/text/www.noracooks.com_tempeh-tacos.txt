Ingredients:
(2) 8-ounce packages tempeh
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2  yellow onion, diced small
1/3 cup low sodium soy sauce
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 tablespoon garlic powder
tiny pinch cayenne pepper (1/8th teaspoon)
4 tablespoons tomato paste
1/2 cup water
corn or flour tortillas
chopped lettuce
diced tomatoes
avocado slices
salsa
Vegan Nacho Cheese (or vegan shredded cheese)
Vegan Sour Cream

Instructions:
Remove the tempeh from the packages, and cut into a few rough pieces. Place in a food processor, and pulse several times until it&#039;s a bit crumbly. Don&#039;t over process into a paste! Alternatively, you can grate it or chop it small.
In a large sauté pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté for 3-4 minutes, until translucent.
Add the tempeh and sauté for about 5 minutes, until the tempeh is golden.
Now add the soy sauce, cumin, smoked paprika, chili powder, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, tomato paste and water. Stir well and bring to simmer. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring constantly. If the mixture gets too dry, add a little bit of water until the consistency is just right.
Serve in warm tortillas with desired toppings. Enjoy!
