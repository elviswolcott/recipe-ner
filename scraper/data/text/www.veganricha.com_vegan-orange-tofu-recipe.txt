Ingredients:
14 oz firm tofu (, pressed for 15 mins, then cubed)
2 tbsp cornstarch, divided
1 tsp flour ((rice flour for crispier or all purpose))
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp garlic powder
a good dash of white or black pepper
4  garlic cloves (, finely chopped)
1 inch ginger (, minced or 1 tbsp grated)
2 tbsp soy sauce  (or use tamari to make gluten-free)
2 tbsp white or rice vinegar
1 cup preferably fresh orange juice
3 tbsp maple syrup (, or use sugar)
1/4 cup water/broth
1.5 tbsp cornstarch (, 2 tbsp for thicker sauce)
1 tsp sriracha or other hot sauce
1/8 tsp salt

Instructions:
Line a stoneware baking dish with parchment or grease. Preheat the oven to 400 deg F(205 C).&nbsp;
Add cubed tofu to a large bowl. Sprinkle 1 tbsp cornstarch, flour, salt, garlic, and pepper. Close the top of the bowl with a plate or lid and shake to coat. Add more cornstarch and shake again.
Spread in the stoneware dish. Bake at 400 deg F for 25 to 35 mins. Give the tofu a shake at the 20-minute mark.
Blanch the broccoli if using. (Tip: I put it in a deep baking dish with water in the oven for 15 -20 mins. Take it out when moving the tofu around).
Combine all the ingredients for Orange Sauce, except water and cornstarch in a saucepan. Cook over medium heat to bring to a boil. Mix cornstarch in the water well and add into the simmering sauce. Mix and Cook for another 2 mins to thicken. Stir well for even thickening. Taste and adjust salt, sweet, flavor.
Add the baked tofu to the sauce and toss to coat. Take off heat.&nbsp;Serve with the broccoli, garnished with scallions, pepper flakes, over rice or grains.
