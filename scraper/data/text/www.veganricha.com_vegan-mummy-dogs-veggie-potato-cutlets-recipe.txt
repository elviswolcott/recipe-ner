Ingredients:
1 tsp oil
1/2 cup finely chopped onion
4 cloves of garlic (minced)
1 inch ginger (minced)
2 cups chopped potatoes (2 large potatoes)
1/4 cup water
1/2 cup chopped carrots
1/2 cup chopped veggies like green beans (cauliflower or other veggies chopped small)
1/3 cup peas (fresh or thawed of frozen)
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp garam masala
1 tsp chaat masala ( or amchur powder (mango powder))
1 tsp coriander powder
1 tsp cumin powder
1/4 to 1/2 tsp cayenne/red chili powder
1/2 to 1 cup bread crumbs
1  Whole wheat Pizza dough (use more flour to roll out gf dough as they are sticky or use puff pastry)

Instructions:
Heat oil in a skillet at medium heat. Add onions and cook for 5 minutes or until translucent. Add garlic and ginger and cook for 2 minutes. Stir frequently so the garlic doesn't stick.
Add the potatoes and water, mix well to combine. Cover and cook for 12 minutes. Stir well. Add the other vegetables, peas, salt. Mix well. Add another Tbsp or water if the potatoes are beginning to stick. Cover and cook at medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes or until potatoes and the vegetables are very tender.
Transfer the veggies to a bowl. Let them cool slightly. Mash well with a potato masher. Add the spices(garam masala through cayenne) and mix well. Taste and add more salt if needed. Add in the breadcrumbs and mix in so the mixture can be easily shaped.
Shape the mixture into 3 to 4 inch long dogs.
Prep the pizza dough. No need to let the pizza dough rise, mix, knead and roll out. Use flour to roll out the dough into a thin rectangle. Using a pizza cutter, cut the dough into thin 1/4 inch or thinner strips. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F / 200Âºc.
Wrap the veggie cutlet dogs in the Pizza dough strips as you like. Use peas or olives to make eyes. Spray or brush oil (optional).
Bake for 11-12 minutes or until the dough is golden. Serve with marinara or ketchup or chutneys
