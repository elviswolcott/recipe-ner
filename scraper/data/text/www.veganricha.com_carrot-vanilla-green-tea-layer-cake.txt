Ingredients:
2/3 cup whole wheat pastry flour
3/4 cup self rising flour (or all purpose flour + 1/4 teaspoon baking powder)
1 tablespoon flax seed meal
4 tablespoons Oats
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon white vinegar
3 tablespoons high fat oil ((I use 2 coconut oil and 1 organic canola))
1 tablespoons roasted Cashew butter ((Homemade nut butter recipes))
6 tablespoons raw granulated sugar or equivalent jaggery or other sweetener. ((a couple of tbsps more for a sweeter cake))
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice powder
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2/3 cup warm water or non dairy milk
1/2 cup shredded carrot for carrot layer
1 teaspoon matcha green tea powder
a couple of blueberries

Instructions:
In a large bowl, add flax meal, vinegar, sugar, oil, cashew butter and 1/2 cup (120ml) almost hot water.
Mix it well till the mixture is well combined and a little light. Add in the oats, mix well and keep aside for a few minutes.
In a bowl, mix the flours, pumpkin pie spice, salt, baking powder.
Add in the wet mixture and mix. If the mixture doesnt become like a batter, add more water/almond milk. Mix until just about combined.
Divide batter into 3 parts.
Add shredded carrots to one part and mix gently in. Add green tea powder to the second part and mix until well combined. Add in the vanilla extract to the third and mix.
Grease a mini loaf well. Add the green tea layer. Spread and let settle.The batter starts to thicken with time, so even it out using a greased spoon/spatula.
Add the vanilla layer. and spread again.
Add in the carrot layer. Spread it evenly and top with some blueberries and a little sugar.
Bake in preheated oven at 350 degrees F for 30-40 minutes or until the toothpick inserted in the Middle comes out clean.
Let cool a little before removing from pan and slicing! The spices get richer after a few hours, if you can wait that is..:)
