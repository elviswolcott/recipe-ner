Ingredients:
1/2 cup vegan butter, melted
1 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 tablespoon ground flaxseeds
1/4 cup soy milk
1 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1/2 cup dutch processed cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup fresh raspberries
1/2 cup non-dairy chocolate chips

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a 8x8 inch pan with parchment paper, with some overhang for easy removal of the brownies.
Melt the vegan butter in a small bowl or measuring cup (I used my microwave), then add it to a large bowl along with the sugar.Â  Mix well with a large spoon. Now stir in the vanilla, flaxseeds and soy milk until well combined.
Over the bowl with the wet ingredients, sift in the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt. Stir until just combined. The dough will be quite thick, so use your hands if needed.
Add most of the raspberries, saving about 10 for the top, and the chocolate chips to the batter. Carefully fold them in, using a spatula or your hands, doing the best you can. The raspberries will break, that is okay, they don&#039;t have to stay whole.
Dump the brownie batter into the pan, and smush it around evenly to all the edges. It&#039;s very thick so it won&#039;t pour in. Make several little indents in the batter and stick some whole raspberries into them.
Place the pan in the center rack of the oven and bake for 30 minutes. For fudgier brownies, only bake for 25 minutes. For more cake-like brownies, bake for 35 minutes.
Remove from oven and let cool for 20 minutes in the pan, then pull them out using the parchment paper and place on a cooling rack to cool for another 15-20 minutes if possible, before slicing and serving. Enjoy!
