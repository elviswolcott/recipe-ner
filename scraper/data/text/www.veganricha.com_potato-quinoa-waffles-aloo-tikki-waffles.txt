Ingredients:
2 medium potatoes (Russett or Yukon gold )
1/4 cup quinoa (uncooked , or use 3/4 cup cooked )
1  hot green chili (such as serrano pepper, finely chopped)
1/3 cup finely chopped onion
2 tsp minced ginger
1/2 cup chopped cilantro
1/2 tsp cumin seeds (or a heaping 1/4 tsp carom seeds)
1/2 tsp cayenne (use less for less heat)
1/2 tsp ground coriander
1/8 tsp baking soda
3/4 tsp salt
1 tsp oil plus more as needed for making the waffles

Instructions:
Peel the potatoes and cut into small pieces. Rinse the quinoa and drain.
Add the potatoes and quinoa to a pressure cooker with 3 cups of water. Pressure Cook in the pressure cooker for 3 minutes, then quick release after 5 minutes.If cooking in a saucepan, cook over medium heat for 15-20 minutes, or until the potatoes are cooked to preference.
Once cooked, drain the potatoes and quinoa, let them drain really well, and cool down a bit. Meanwhile, prep the rest of the ingredients. You can also use pre-cooked potatoes and quinoa instead of cooking them together.
Add the potato and quinoa to a large bowl and mash, add the rest of the ingredients and mix well. Taste and adjust salt if needed. You can add other flavors here as you wish.
Heat your waffle iron, drizzle a bit of oil on the waffle iron, then place a 1/4 cup or more of the mixture, depending on the size of the waffle iron. Close the iron and cook until the waffles are golden brown on both sides. This can take quite a bit of time depending on the waffle iron, and potatoes.
If you want these to be sturdier, and more crispy, you can add in a 1/4 cup of flour or breadcrumbs into the mixture, and then waffle it.Serve with chutneys, ketchup or topped with chickpea curry or other bean curries and salsa/Pico de Gallo
