Ingredients:
2/3 cup whole wheat pastry flour
1/4 cup all purpose flour
1 Tablespoons flax seed meal
1 teaspoon baking powder
2 teaspoons white vinegar
1/2  medium ripe apple
4 tablespoons high fat oil ((I used 2 Tbsp organic canola oil and 2 Tbsp Coconut oil))
5-6 tablespoons raw sugar or equivalent jaggery or other sweetener.
3 tablespoons cocoa powder ((I have organic fair trade unsweetened non alkaline, reduce cocoa powder if you like less dark cake))
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon powder
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
6-8 Tablespoons warm water or non dairy milk
vegan chocolate chips ((optional, I dint use any, you can add some to the batter for melted chips in the cake!))

Instructions:
In a blender, add chopped apple, flax meal, vinegar, sugar, vanilla extract, oil and 6 Tablespoons warm water.
Blend into a smooth puree and keep aside.
In a bowl, mix the flours, cinnamon, salt, baking powder and cocoa powder.
Add in the apple puree and mix till just about combined. If the mixture doesnt become moist and pasty , add more water. The water content need depends on the water content of the apple. The batter does not need to be smooth and runny.
Grease a mini loaf and pour the batter in it.
Top with some oats and bake in preheated oven at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until the toothpick inserted in the Middle comes out clean.
Or top it off with some chocolate cream.. Blend some avocado, a couple of teaspoons of cocoa powder and maple syrup to get a cream. Adjust sweetness and layer it on the cake!
