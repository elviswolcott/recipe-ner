Ingredients:
9 oz whole wheat spaghetti
1 tablespoon olive oil
1  onion, chopped
1  clove of garlic, minced
1  large carrot, cut into small pieces
2 stalks of celery, cut into small pieces
3/4 cup red lentils
3 tablespoons tomato paste
1/3 cup dry red wine (use a vegan brand)
1 can  diced tomatoes (14,5 oz)
2 cups vegetable broth
1 teaspoon soy sauce ((optional, leave it out for a soy-free version))
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
salt
pepper
fresh basil to sprinkle

Instructions:
Cook the spaghetti according to the instructions on the package. Set aside.
In a large sauce pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Saut√© the onion for about 2 minutes. Then add the garlic and cook it for another minute.
Add the carrots and celery and cook for a further 3 minutes. Then stir in the red lentils and the tomato paste. After another minute, deglaze with red wine and allow to evaporate (this will take about 1 minute).
Add the diced tomatoes and vegetable broth and simmer for about 15-20 minutes until the sauce is thick and the lentils are fairly soft and good to eat (they shouldn't be too soft).
Season with the Italian spices, salt, and pepper and - if using - soy sauce. Serve together with the spaghetti and sprinkle with some fresh basil leaves.
