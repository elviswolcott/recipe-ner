Ingredients:
10 to 12 oz pasta
2 tsp oil
1/4 tsp each of cumin seeds (coriander seeds, nigella seeds)
1/8 tsp each of fenugreek seeds (fennel seeds)
1/4 cup finely chopped red onion
3 cloves of garlic (chopped)
1/2 inch piece of ginger (chopped)
1/4 tsp cayenne
1/4 tsp garam masala
1/4 tsp cinnamon
1  medium tomato chopped
1/3 cup raw cashews
1/2 cup water (use 1 cup water for thinner sauce, the sauce thickens quite a bit)
3/4 to 1 tsp salt
1 tsp lime juice
2 tbsp nutritional yeast
1 1/4 cup non dairy milk
1/4 tsp black pepper
1/4 tsp onion granules

Instructions:
Cook the pasta according to instructions.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add all the whole spices/seeds and cook for 2 minutes or until they change color and get fragrant. Add the onion, garlic, ginger and a pinch of salt. Cook until translucent. 3 to 4 minutes. Add cayenne, garam masala and cinnamon. Give it a quick mix. Add tomatoes, cashews, water, salt and lime juice, bring to a boil and cook for a few minutes. Total 6 to 7 minutes.
Cool slightly and blend with nutritional yeast and non dairy milk in a high speed blender, until smooth. Return the sauce to the skillet. Add cooked pasta and black pepper, onion granules cover and cook over low-medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes,or until it thickens. At this point I usually add some chopped broccoli or baby greens and fold in.
Stir, taste and adjust salt, spice and tang. Add prepared mustard for additional tang if needed. Cover and let it sit for 5 minutes. Serve garnished with cilantro and paprika. Add a side of grilled Spiced Tofu and a small salad on the side to make a meal.
