Ingredients:
16 ounces uncooked farfalle or rotini pasta
1 cup halved cherry tomatoes
1 small red onion, sliced (2/3 cup)
1 cup diced cucumber
1/2 large red bell pepper, seeded and sliced
1/4 cup sliced pepperoncini
1 cup sliced black olives
1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley
1 block vegan cheddar cheese, cut into cubes (I used Violife brand)
Vegan Parmesan (optional)
1/2 cup red wine vinegar
1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
1 1/2 teaspoons granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon dried oregano
3 tablespoons juice from pepperoncini jar

Instructions:
Cook the pasta according to package instructions, then drain and rinse in cold water. Add cooked pasta to a large bowl and toss in a few teaspoons of olive oil, so it doesn&#039;t stick together.
While the pasta cooks, chop and slice all the vegetables and cheese. Set aside.
Whisk all dressing ingredients in a medium bowl until well combined. You can also simply add all the dressing ingredients to a jar with a lid, and shake until combined.
To the bowl with the pasta, add the vegetables, cheese and dressing. Stir to combine.
Cover the bowl and chill for at least 30 minutes if possible before serving. It will stay good for up to 5 days. Right before serving, sprinkle with Vegan Parmesan, if desired. Enjoy!
