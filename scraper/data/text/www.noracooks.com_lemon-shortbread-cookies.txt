Ingredients:
1 Recipe Vegan Lemon Curd
1 1/4 cups all purpose flour
1/2 cup powdered sugar
1/2 cup (8 Tbs) vegan butter, softened
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 tablespoon almond milk, as needed (*other non-dairy milks work as well)
1/2 cup powdered sugar
1-2 tablespoons almond milk

Instructions:
First, prepare Vegan Lemon Curd. You will want to make this a few hours before the cookies so it has time to cool and thicken, or make it a day or two before the cookies. You won&#039;t use all of it.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and lightly grease a baking sheet (or line with parchment paper).
In a large bowl, whisk the flour and powdered sugar together. Now add the vegan butter (softened) and vanilla and mix with a hand mixer (or stand mixer) on low-medium speed until mixed well. If the mixture is too crumbly to form into cookies, add a tablespoon of almond milk and mix in.
The dough might look a little crumbly but should smush together when squeezed in your hands. If not, add a touch more almond milk, but not too much or the cookies will spread when baking.
Shape the dough into small balls, about 1 tablespoon each. Gently indent the center of each cookie dough ball, making a place for the lemon curd to go. Place the cookies on the prepared pan.
Fill the cookies with cooled lemon curd, then bake for 10-12 minutes. The bottom of the cookies will be slightly golden, but otherwise they will appear underdone. They firm up as they cool.
Make the glaze: In a small bowl, whisk the powdered sugar and almond milk together until smooth. If too runny, add more powdered sugar until it&#039;s quite thick for drizzling. If too thick, add a tiny bit of almond milk and whisk.
Once the cookies have cooled completely, drizzle the glaze over the tops and allow the glaze to set for several minutes. Serve and enjoy!
