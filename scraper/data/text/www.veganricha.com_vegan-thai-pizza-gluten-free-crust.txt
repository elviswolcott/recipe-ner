Ingredients:
1/2 recipe Peanut butter sauce
1/2  red onion sliced
1/2  bell pepper sliced (green or red)
1/2  cup Sliced carrots
sliced jalapenos
1 tablespoon crushed peanuts
Mung Bean Sprouts (home sprouted or store bought or other sprouts)
vegan cheese shreds of choice  (optional)
salt (pepper, lemon juice, cilantro and scallions for garnish)
For the Gluten-free Crust (or use any of my regular crusts)

Instructions:
Make the crust: Instructions below for the gluten-free crust
In a bowl whisk all the dry ingredients for the crust and keep aside.
In another bowl, combine water, yeast and sugar and let it sit until frothy. about 5 minutes. Add the flax seed meal and mix in. Let it sit for a minute.
Add the dry to the wet. Add in the yogurt and oil and mix well. Let the sticky dough sit for 10 minutes.
Using flour or oil on your hands shape the dough into a flat ball. Place ball on parchment lined pie pan.
Spray water or oil, press with your hands and shape the dough to fit the pan with atleast 1/2 inch edge going up the sides. You can also use flour and roll the dough out between parchment sheets and then place in the pie pan.
Even out the edges and let it sit for 15 minutes in a warm place. I usually put it near the oven when the over pre-heats.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F / 200c.
Place another parchment on top of the pie pan. Bake for 10 minutes. Prep the veggies and peanut butter sauce.
Uncover and remove the pie pan from the oven. Pour the peanut sauce on the crust. Reserve a tablespoon or two sauce for garnish before serving. Layer the onions, bell peppers, crushed peanuts, carrots, jalapenos.
Layer the sprouts, salt, pepper, lemon juice and vegan cheese shreds. Spray water on the crust edges.
Bake for 14 minutes. Broil for 1 to 2 minutes to brown the edges.
Take the pizza out, Let it sit for 2 minutes before removing from parchment.
Drizzle with the remaining peanut sauce. Garnish with pepper flakes, cilantro and scallions.
Slice and serve.
