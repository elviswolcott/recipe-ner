Ingredients:
9 oz pasta (rotini or farfalle)
2 cups cherry tomatoes, cut into halves
3/4  English cucumber, cut into quartered pieces
6  artichoke hearts in brine, drained and roughly chopped ((1 14 oz can))
1  red onion, cut into stripes
20  black olives
1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
8 oz very firm tofu
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk
1 teaspoon dried thyme
3  cloves of garlic, minced
1 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoons olive oil
2  cloves of garlic, minced
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar or red wine vinegar
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried thyme
salt
pepper

Instructions:
First, make the vegan feta cheese: The night before making the salad, cut the tofu into small cubes. In a small bowl, combine all of the ingredients for the marinade. Fill the tofu and the marinade into a ziploc bag and store it overnight in the fridge. If you don't have much time, you could also get away with marinating it for about 4 hours. But it's definitely better if you marinate it for a longer time. Also make sure that you got a very firm tofu. It makes the best texture!
Cook the pasta according to the instructions on the package. Set aside and let it cool down a bit (not completely). Chop the remaining ingredients and make the dressing.
In a large bowl, combine all ingredients for the pasta salad including the vegan feta. Add the dressing and toss.
Refrigerate for at least 2-3 hours before serving.
