Ingredients:
12 ounce package impossible ground meat (see notes for options)
1 medium onion, chopped small
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon salt
10 small corn tortillas or 4-5 medium flour tortillas, cut into strips
15- ounce can black beans, drained and rinsed
1 cup corn (I used frozen)
19 ounces enchilada sauce (vegan friendly)
1-2 cups shredded vegan cheese
Vegan Sour Cream
chopped green onions
sliced black olives

Instructions:
Heat a large cast iron pan or other skillet over medium-high heat.
Add the vegan beef and diced onion and cook for about 10 minutes, breaking it into pieces and stirring frequently.
Now add the garlic and salt, and stir for about a minute.
Add the cut up corn tortilla pieces, black beans, corn and enchilada sauce. Stir it up, then cover and reduce the heat to low for about 10 minutes.
Uncover, sprinkle on the cheese, then cover again and remove from heat. Let it sit for a few minutes so the cheese can melt.
Serve with Vegan Sour Cream, chopped green onions and sliced black olives, if desired.
