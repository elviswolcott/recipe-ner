Ingredients:
1 lb. Purple sweet potatoes (peeled and cut into cubes)
2 3/4 cup Almond milk (unsweetened)
2/3 cup Sugar (granulated)
1/4 cup Maple syrup
1 tsp. Vanilla extract
1 tsp. Lime juice (fresh)
2 tsp. Vodka or tequila reposado (optional)
1/4 cup Pecans (toasted)
1/2 cup Pineapple (chopped)

Instructions:
Place sweet potatoes in a medium saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes or until potatoes are tender.
Let cool to room temperature.
In a blender, combine the sweet potatoes, almond milk, sugar, maple syrup, vanilla, lime juice, and tequila. Process until smooth. The mixture should have the thickness of a heavy cream.
Chill for at least an hour in the refrigerator, then pour into your ice cream maker according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.
You can mix in the pecans and pineapple in to the ice cream after the machine has finished spinning or you can add them to the machine when the ice cream is about to be done.
Eat right away or freeze up to 5 hours to let the ice cream harden a bit.
