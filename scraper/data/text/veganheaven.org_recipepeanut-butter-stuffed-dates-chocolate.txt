Ingredients:
10  Medjool dates
2-3 tablespoons peanut butter
1/4 cup peanuts
1/2 cup (about 4 oz) vegan dark chocolate

Instructions:
Cut the dates open to remove the pit. It's best to cut down lengthwise into the dates.
Then fill them with some peanut butter, add two or three peanut halves and put them back together.
Next, melt the dark chocolate. You can either do this in a microwave or in a small sauce pot on the stove. Then dip the dates in the chocolate. Allow the chocolate to harden (this will take about 5 minutes) and you got healthy vegan snickers with just four ingredients!
