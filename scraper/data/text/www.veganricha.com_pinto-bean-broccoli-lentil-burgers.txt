Wash the lentils. Drain and add to pan. Add the tomato, garlic, salt and water, partially cover and cook over medium heat for 10 minutes.
Add broccoli and mix in. Cook uncovered for 10 to 12 minutes or until the lentils are tender and all the liquid is gone. Stir once or twice in between to avoid sticking. Cool slightly. Drain if there is excess water.
Add the cooked lentils, pinto beans, spices to a bowl and mix well. Mash so that most pinto beans are well mashed and mix. Add onion and lemon juice and mix in. Taste and add more salt if needed (depends on if the pinto beans were salted, you might need 1/4 to 1/2 tsp more). The mixture will be soft. Chill in the freezer for 15 minutes (or 25 minutes in the refrigerator).
Add flour or breadcrumbs. Mix in. Add more if needed. Shape into patties by pressing into a cookie cutter and pan fry 3 to 4 minutes on each side with a little oil. Or Bake at pre-heated 400 degrees F / 200c for 20 minutes, then flip and bake for 5 to 10 minutes.
