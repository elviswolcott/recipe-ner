Ingredients:
3 cups Vegetable broth (hot)
1 tsp. No-chicken bouillon
1 pack Soy curls ((8 oz. ))
1 tsp. Primal Kitchen Extra Virgin Olive Oil ((optional))
1  Yellow onion (thinly sliced)
1 bottle  Primal Kitchen Mango Jalapeño BBQ sauce ((9 oz))
12  Slider buns
2 cups Coleslaw
½ cup Sliced dill pickles

Instructions:
Pour 2 cups of the vegetable broth in a medium saucepot and add the no-chicken bouillon. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Place the soy curls in a heat-proof bowl and pour the broth over the soy curls. Use a fork to press the soy curls down so they can absorb all of the liquid, and let soak for 10 min.
In the meantime, set your smoker to 250°F. I (a.k.a my husband) likes to use oak but you can also use pecan, apple, mesquite or hickory.
Place 1/3 third of the soaked soy curls in the blender and pulse several times to shred them to resemble pulled meat. This will not work in the food processor. Repeat this with the remaining soy curls.
Place a sheet of parchment paper on top of an oven-safe wire rick. Place the shredded soy curls on top of the parchment paper and smoke for 25 minutes at 250°F. Remove from the smoker and set aside.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion and sauté until they start to turn golden brown, 8 minutes. Stir in soy curls, lower heat and add bbq sauce. Pour the remaining broth in the pan. (I like to pour some in the barbecue bottle and shake it to get the last bit of sauce out). Simmer until all the liquid evaporates, 4 minutes.
Serve on buns with coleslaw and pickles. Enjoy!!
