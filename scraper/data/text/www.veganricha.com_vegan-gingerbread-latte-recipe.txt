Ingredients:
1/3 to 1/2 cup espresso coffee or prepared coffee (or use 1/3 cup water/decaf for caffeine free)
1/2 tsp minced ginger
1/2 tsp gingerbread spice
1 tbsp dark brown sugar, or use plain sugar/maple syrup and 2 tsp molasses
1.5 cups non dairy milk (, I like almond, soy or coconut milk)

Instructions:
Add the first 4 ingredients to a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, and simmer for 2 mins. (This is the simple ginger syrup. Strain and refrigerate to use later)
Add blended or frothed non dairy milk to the saucepan and mix in. (Blend the milk in a blender for a minute to froth). Bring to just about a boil. Taste and adjust flavor(add more spice or sugar if needed)
Pour into cups (strain if you havent at step 1). Add whipped coconut cream if desired and a sprinkle of gingerbread spice.
