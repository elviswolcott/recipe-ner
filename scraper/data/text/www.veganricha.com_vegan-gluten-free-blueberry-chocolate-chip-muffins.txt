Ingredients:
1/2 cup oat flour  (or use other gf flours or gf blend)
1/4 cup coconut flour
1/4 cup almond flour (ground raw almonds)
1/4 cup starch such as corn starch or arrowroot
1 1/4 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/2 cup non dairy milk
1 Tbsp flax seed meal
1/4 cup non dairy yogurt (I used So delicious cultured coconut milk plain)
1 tsp apple cider vinegar
1 tsp vanilla extract
2 Tbsp oil  (or melted vegan butter)
1/2 cup powdered sugar of choice (2 Tablespoons more for sweeter)
1/2  loaded cup blueberries (I used frozen)
1/3 to 1/2 cup vegan chocolate chips

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F / 220c. In a large bowl, mix all the dry ingredients and keep aside. In another bowl, mix the almond milk, flax meal, yogurt and vinegar and let sit for 2 minutes. Add the rest of the wet ingredients and mix well until the sugar is combined.
Add the wet to the dry and and mix till just about combined. Do not let the mixture sit too long at this point as it keeps thickening. Toss the blueberries in 1 tbsp oat flour to coat and then add to batter. Add the chocolate chips. Fold in to just combine. Spoon the batter into lined or greased muffin pan.
Bake for 21 to 22 minutes or until a toothpick from the center comes out clean. (frozen berries will need a minute or 2 longer - 22 to 23 minutes). Remove the muffins from the pan, cover with parchment or towel while they cool for 10 minutes. (important to cover the muffins so they dont dry out). Serve.
