Ingredients:
1 tablespoon ground flaxseeds
1/2 cup almond milk
1/3 cup maple syrup
1/4 cup unsweetened apple sauce
1 teaspoon natural vanilla extract
1/2 cup cocoa powder
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon oil
1 cup powdered sugar
1/3 cup vegan butter
3 tablespoons strawberry preserve
1 teaspoon natural vanilla extract
coconut flakes
strawberries
chopped dark chocolate

Instructions:
Combine the ground flaxseeds with 3 tablespoons of water and let them soak for about 5 minutes. In a medium bowl, combine all ingredients (including the flaxseed water mixture) for the chocolate donuts and stir well with a wooden spoon. Spray the donut pan with cooking spray or grease it with vegan margarine. Either use a spoon to fill each donut or fill the batter into a Ziploc bag and cut off one edge.
Preheat the oven to 350 Â°F and bake the vegan chocolate donuts for 12 minutes. Allow to cool down in the pan for a couple of minutes, then move them to a cooling rack.
In the meantime, make the strawberry frosting. Combine all ingredients in a bowl and beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy.
Evenly spread the frosting on the donuts and sprinkle with coconut flakes, chopped chocolate, and strawberries. Store them in the fridge!
