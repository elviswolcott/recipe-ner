Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1/4 cup cocoa powder (dutch processed works best here)
1/2 cup sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
2 1/2 cups soy milk (or other non-dairy milk)
2/3 cup water
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/4 cup canola oil (may also use melted coconut oil or vegan butter)
Optional: Vegan Chocolate Ganache, for serving
3/4-1 cup non-dairy chocolate chips, for serving

Instructions:
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder and salt.
Now pour in the soy milk, water, vanilla and oil and stir with a large spoon until combined but be careful not to over mix or the pancakes won&#039;t be as fluffy. A few lumps are okay.
Heat a large pan over medium-high heat. Spray with oil or add a little vegan butter if needed (I have a non-stick griddle that does not require oiling). Drop about 1/3 cup of the batter onto the pan. Cook until bubbles form, then flip and cook 1-2 minutes on the other side. Repeat with all the remaining batter.
Serve immediately with vegan chocolate ganache, chocolate chips and vegan whipped cream if desired. Vegan butter, maple syrup and chocolate chips is also a tasty serving option.
