Ingredients:
1 cup quinoa
1 can black beans
1 1/2 cups corn
2 cups cherry tomatoes
1  red bell pepper
1  green bell pepper
1  yellow bell pepper
1/2 cup cilantro
1  red onion
2  green onions
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
juice of 1/2 lime
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon paprika powder
1 splash maple syrup
2 tablespoons water
2  cloves of garlic, minced
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste

Instructions:
Cook your quinoa. I usually make mine in the Instant Pot and it turns out perfect and fluffy every time. I cook it with one cup of water for 1 minute on high pressure and let the pressure release naturally for 12 minutes. 
Rinse and drain the black beans and the corn. Cut the cherry tomatoes into halves and the bell pepper into medium-sized pieces. Finely chop the cilantro. Chop the red onion. Cut the green onion into rings.
Combine all ingredients in a large bowl. 
Make the dressing. Combine all ingredients in a small bowl and stir until combined. 
In a large bowl, combine the cooked quinoa, the vegetables and beans, and the dressing. Store the salad in the fridge until you serve it.
