Ingredients:
2  bananas
2 handful spinach
1 cup pineapple
1 teaspoon chlorella
3  dates
1  kiwi
2  peaches
1 1/2 cups water
1  kiwi

Instructions:
Put all ingredients into a food processor or blender and blend until smooth.
Cut the kiwi into very thin slices and put them on the inside of the popsicles molds. They will only stick if the slices are really thin.
Carefully fill the smoothie into the popsicle molds, add a popsicle stick, and freeze them for about 12 hours. To get the homemade popsicles out of the mold, just put the popsicles molds under hot running water for a few seconds. Enjoy!
