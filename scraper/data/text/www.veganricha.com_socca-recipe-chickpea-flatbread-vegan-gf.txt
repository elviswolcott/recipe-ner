Ingredients:
1 cup chickpea flour ((garbanzo bean flour))
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper flakes ( or to taste)
1/2 tsp rosemary
1 tsp oil (, plus more for cooking.(I use olive oil in the batter and a neutral oil for cooking))
1 cup water

Instructions:
Mix all the dry ingredients in a bowl until well mixed.
Add the oil and 3/4 cup water and mix(use a whisk for faster mixing), add more water to make a thick smooth batter. (Depending on measuring and how packed the flour was, you will need 1 tbsp less than a cup or whole 1 cup. Make a Thick batter for thicker pancakes and thin batter for crispy crepe like result.**). Cover and let it rest for at least half an hour to overnight. If keeping overnight, cover the bowl and refrigerate.
Stove top: Heat a cast iron skillet over medium heat. When hot add a few drops of oil and spread well. Add a ladle-full of the batter. Cook for 4 to 6 minutes then use a spatula to loosen the flatbread. If it is still sticking, let the bread cook longer and then try again. Flip and cook for another 2 to 3 mins. Cooking time will depend on the pan, stove and thickness of the batter.
Bake: Preheat the oven to 450 deg F(230 C). Place the cast iron skillet in the oven for 20 mins. Remove the skillet carefully, drizzle oil and spread the batter on it.Â Bake for 8 to 12 minutes depending on the batter thickness. You can add some toppings now and bake for another 3-5 mins, Or flip the socca carefully and continue to bake for another 3 to 5 mins depending on preferred crispyness.
Store on the counter covered lightly with a towel before serving. You can serve the socca as is or sliced as a flatbread with dips, or with soups.Refrigerate cooked socca for upto 3 days. Refrigerate the batter for upto 2 days and make socca as needed.
