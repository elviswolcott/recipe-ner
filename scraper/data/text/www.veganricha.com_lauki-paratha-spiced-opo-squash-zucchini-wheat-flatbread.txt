Ingredients:
2 cups grated lauki (Opo Squash/ bottle gourd or Zucchini or other squash of choice)
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 to 1/2 tsp cayenne /red chili powder
1/3 tsp carom seeds (ajwain/ajowan or 1/2 tsp roasted cumin seeds)
1/2 tsp dry mango powder
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup unbleached white flour  (or more wheat flour)
1 tbsp tahini (loaded) (sesame seed butter, or use other seed butter or nut butter or use oil)
3 to 4 tbsp aquafaba or use water (aquafaba - water from a can of chickpeas, keeps flatbreads soft)
1/2 cup wheat flour for dusting
oil for cooking (optional)

Instructions:
Grate the squash using a large grater or use a food processor. Transfer to a large bowl.
Add salt, spices, flour and tahini and mix in. Let it sit for 3 to 4 minutes.
Add 2 to 3 tbsp of water and knead into a dough. Press with your hands to help the squash release moisture into the dough. The dough will come together within a minute or so. Add more water if needed (depends on the squash or veggie used). Do not add too much, as the squash will keep leaking moisture as it sits.
Once the dough is somewhat formed. Let it sit for 5 minutes.
Oil your hands and knead again for a few seconds. Add more flour if needed as there may be more moisture leaking from the squash.
Divide into 8 to 9 equal balls. Roll out each ball using ample flour into round flatbreads.
Heat a skillet over medium high heat and cook the flatbread until brown spots appear on both sides. Depending on your skillet and stove, this can take 3 to 6 minutes. Flip after after 2 minutes. Brush oil or vegan butter if needed towards the end.
Take off heat. Serve warm with vegan butter, Indian pickles, or as side with curries, Dals, soups. or slice the flatbread and serve with a dip of choice.
Store in a kitchen towel for a few hours over the counter. Refrigerate if storing for longer.
