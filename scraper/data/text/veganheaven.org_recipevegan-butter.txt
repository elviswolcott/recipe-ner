Ingredients:
1/4 cup cashews
1 cup coconut oil, melted
2 teaspoons nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup unsweetened soy or almond milk
1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
1 pinch turmeric
3 tablespoons canola oil

Instructions:
Place the cashews in a blender and process until they resemble a fine flour. This should take about a minute. 
Add the remaining ingredients and process until everything is well combined.
Transfer the mixture into a small glass dish and place it in the fridge for at least 2 hours.
