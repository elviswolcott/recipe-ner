Ingredients:
1  prebaked pie crust. I use a gf graham cracker style crust (, See notes for crust recipes and refined sugar free option)
1 1/4 cup dairy-free yogurt ((such as kite hill almond plain yogurt, vanilla will work as well))
1/2 cup smooth cashew butter ((almond or peanut butter can be used, peanut adds a stronger flavor))
6 oz vegan cream cheese ((such as kite hill plain almond cream cheese))
1 tsp vanilla extract
2 - 3 tsp lime juice ((or lemon juice))
2 tbsp cornstarch ((1.5 tbsp for a less set cheesecake))
1/4 tsp salt
11  soft dates (, pitted )
2 - 3 tbsp coconut sugar ((or other sugar/sweetener))
optional flavor additions: 1 tsp lime or lemon zest , a few drops of almond extract

Instructions:
Prep and par bake the crust of choice if you havent already. Preheat the oven to 350 deg F (180 C).
Blend all the ingredients under cheesecake. Taste and adjust sweet and tang. The tang gets stronger with baking. Add a few tablespoons&nbsp;sugar if needed. Add 2-3 tablespoons water if needed for blending.&nbsp;
Pour into prepared crust and spread with a spatula to even it out.&nbsp;
Bake for 35 to 45 minutes(depends on the cream cheese brand, moisture content in the filling, choice of ingredients. The top should be set and center should not be liquid).&nbsp;Cool completely. Chill for 4 to 6 hours. Slice and serve with whipped coconut cream or vegan ice cream of choice with fresh berries or a berry compote.&nbsp;
