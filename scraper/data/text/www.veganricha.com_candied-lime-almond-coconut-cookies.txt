Ingredients:
1/2  medium lime ((sliced into 1-2mm slices))
3/4 cup water
4 Tablespoon raw sugar or jaggery or any sweetener that can caramelize a bit
2 teaspoons flax meal
2 Tablespoon hot water
2 Tablespoons Raw turbinado sugar or coconut sugar or jaggery or sweetener of choice ((I used 1 Tbsp for mild sweetness))
3 -4 Tablespoons sweet syrup ((from the candied lime))
1 Tablespoon vegan butter or organic canola oil
1 Tablespoon virgin coconut oil
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
2 Tablespoons dried coconut flakes
2 Tablespoons oat flour ((Bobâ€™s Red Mill Organic Old Fashioned))
2 Tablespoons Almond meal
1/2 - 2/3 cup self rising flour or all purpose + 1/4 tsp baking powder

Instructions:
In a pan, add a cup (235ml) of water and bring to a boil. Add the sugar, and mix well. Simmer for 2 minutes.
Add in the sliced lime and cook on low heat for 30-40 minutes or until the syrup thickens and starts to bubble up.
I got about 5-6 Tablespoons of thick syrup with lime slices in it. You can remove the lime slices and coat them with powdered sugar and keep refrigerated for a few weeks. I chopped up the slices into small pieces and left them in the syrup, since I was going to use them within the next few days.
I used 3-4 Tablespoons of the syrup in the cookies and The remaining syrup went in some multigrain pancakes, which turned out an amazing. fluffy and limey! My multigrain pancake recipe here.
