Ingredients:
12 cloves Garlic (not peeled)
1  Red onion (thinly sliced)
4  Serrano peppers
6  Avocadoes (medium-large, pitted, flesh scooped)
2  Oranges (large, cut into segments)
To taste Lime juice (fresh)
Â¼ cup Cilantro (chopped)

Instructions:
Set your oven broiler on high.
Line a sheet tray with foil or parchment paper and place the garlic, sliced onion, and Serrano peppers on it.
Place under broiler for 7 min. Remove the garlic from the oven and set aside. Flip the peppers and toss the onion so it chars evenly. Return to oven for 5 -7 more minutes or until the peppers and onion are charred, but not burnt. Chop the onion and peppers and set aside.
Peel garlic and place in a molcajete, mortar and pestle or you can use your knife to turn the garlic into a paste.
Place the garlic paste in a large bowl and add the chopped pepper and onion, avocado, and chopped cilantro. Mash with a potato masher to the desired consistency (I like mine chunky).
Season with salt and pepper and lime juice to taste.
Cut the orange supremes in half and fold them into the guacamole. Serve with your favorite chips.
