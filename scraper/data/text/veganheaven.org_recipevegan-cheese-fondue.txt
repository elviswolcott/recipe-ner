Ingredients:
3/4 cup white wine
3/4 cup nutritional yeast
1/2 cup vegetable broth
3/4 cup unsweetend almond or soy milk
1 tablespoon white miso paste
1  clove of garlic, minced
1-2 tablespoons mustard
1 teaspoon tahini
1 pinch pepper
1 pinch salt
1 pinch nutmeg
4 tablespoons flour
French baguette
mushrooms
grapes

Instructions:
Put all ingredients (except for the flour) in a pot and cook for about 5 minutes.
Then stir in the flour and wait until it all thickens up. If it's too thick add some more plant-based milk. If it's too thin add more flour. When it's ready, you can either transfer it to a caquelon or just use a regular bowl instead. However, it's better to use a real fondue pot, a so-called caquelon, as it keeps the cheese sauce hot.
