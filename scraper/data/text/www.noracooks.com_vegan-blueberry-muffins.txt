Ingredients:
1 1/4 cup unsweetened soy milk
1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
2 cups all purpose flour (see notes for substitutions)
1 cup granulated sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/3 cup canola oil
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups fresh blueberries
1-2 tablespoons coarse sugar, optional, for sprinkling the tops

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a standard muffin pan with liners and spray them lightly with oil.&nbsp;
Combine the soy milk and apple cider vinegar in a measuring cup and set aside to curdle. This is your "buttermilk".
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together all the dry ingredients: flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and cornstarch.&nbsp;
Pour in the soy milk/vinegar mixture, canola oil and vanilla. Stir with a large spoon to combine, but do not over mix. Some small lumps are fine.
Fold in the blueberries, gently. Using a small measuring cup or ice cream scoop, add batter to the liners in the pan 3/4 of the way full. Top with a few extra blueberries and a sprinkle of coarse sugar, if desired.
Bake for 22-26 minutes, until golden brown on top and a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Let cool 5 minutes in the pan, then move to a cooling rack. Eat and enjoy!
Store leftover muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for about 3 days. You can also freeze them by wrapping them in plastic wrap and placing them in a large freezer bag.
