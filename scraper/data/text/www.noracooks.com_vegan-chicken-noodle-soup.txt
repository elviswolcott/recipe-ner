Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large  onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
3 stalks celery, sliced
3 medium carrots, peeled and sliced
8 cups vegan &quot;chicken&quot; broth (or vegetable broth)
2 cups vegan &quot;chicken&quot; pieces, chopped small*
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
12 ounces small shaped pasta*
salt + pepper, to taste
fresh chopped parsley, for serving
crackers or french bread, for serving

Instructions:
Add the olive oil to a large pot and warm over medium-high heat. Now add the onion, garlic and celery and saute for 5 minutes, until softened and the onions are translucent.
Add the carrots, broth, chopped vegan chicken pieces, basil and thyme. Bring to a boil, then simmer for 10 minutes.
While the soup simmers, cook the pasta in a separate pot according to package instructions but 1 minute less than called for. You don&#x27;t want to overcook the noodles. Drain and set aside.
Taste the soup and make any necessary seasoning adjustments, such as more herbs, salt + pepper.
Serve the soup in bowls with a handful of cooked noodles. Sprinkle with fresh parsley if desired and serve with crackers or bread. Keep the pasta noodles separate when storing so they don&#x27;t get mushy and soak up all the broth.
