Ingredients:
1  flax egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 2.5 tablespoons water)
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoon coconut oil, melted
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
2 cups almond flour
1/2 cup dairy free chocolate chips

Instructions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Make the flax egg: In a small bowl, combine 1 tablespoon ground flax with 2.5 tablespoons warm water. Let sit for a few minutes.
Cream together brown sugar and coconut oil with a wooden spoon in a large bowl.
Add baking soda, salt, vanilla and the flax egg. Mix well.
Add the almond flour to the bowl and mix until combined.
Fold in the chocolate chips.
Scoop the dough by heaping tablespoons and roll into about 12 balls. Place onto prepared baking sheet and flatten slightly with your hand.
Bake for 10-12 minutes. Let cool for at least 10 minutes before moving to cooling rack or eating. They will firm up a bit as they sit. Store in a covered container for 3-4 days at room temperature, or longer in the refrigerator.
