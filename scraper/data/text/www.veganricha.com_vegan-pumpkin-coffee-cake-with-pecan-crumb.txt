Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups flour ((I generally use a mix of Spelt/Wheat and unbleached all purpose))
 cup powdered vegan sugar ((Use 2 tbsp more for sweeter))
2 tsp baking powder
 tsp baking soda
 teaspoon salt
2 to 4 tsp  pumpkin pie spice  (( or 11/2 tsp cinnamon,  tsp ginger,  to  tsp nutmeg,  tsp cloves))
3 to 4 tbsp chopped walnuts or pecans
1 cup pureed pumpkin (,not pumpkin pie mix)
 cup non dairy milk ( (almond or soy or lite coconut))
3 to 4 Tbsp oil
1 tsp lemon juice
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
6 tablespoons flour
1/3 cup coconut sugar
1 tbsp granulated sugar (, optional)
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon or chai spice or a mix of cardamom and cinnamon
1/3 tsp salt
2.5 tbsp refined coconut oil

Instructions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a brownie pan with parchment. In a bowl, add all the dry ingredients and whisk well.
Add the wet ingredients to the bowl and mix to just about combine. Let it sit for 2 minutes, then mix again to ensure there are no dry flour streaks. Pour the thick batter into the brownie pan. Even it out using a spatula.
Make the Streusel by mixing everything in a bowl with your fingers or a spoon until crumbly, Add a tsp or so more oil if needed.
Sprinkle all over the cake and evenly spread. Bake the cake for 40 to 45 minutes. Test with a toothpick from the center.
Cool completely before slicing. Serve with turmeric pumpkin spice latte.. For a decadent dessert, add a light drizzle of plain sugar icing.
