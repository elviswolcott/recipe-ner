Ingredients:
8 ounce bag soy curls
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 pound broccoli florets
1-3 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons kitchen bouquet, optional for browning
1/2 cup low sodium soy sauce (*use tamari for gluten free)
2 tablespoons kitchen bouquet, optional
3 tablespoons brown sugar
1/3 cup water
1 teaspoon red chili flakes
1 tablespoon grated ginger
5 cloves minced garlic
2 tablespoons cornstarch
cooked brown or white rice, about 4-5 cups cooked
chopped green onions
sesame seeds
additional chili flakes or hot sauce

Instructions:
In a large bowl, add the dehydrated soy curls, then cover with about 4 cups of hot water. Let them rehydrate for about 10 minutes until they have grown in size and softened. Drain in a colander and squeeze any excess water from the pieces.
Using the same bowl (once empty), add the soy curls back to it, along with the cornstarch and stir to coat. I use my hands to really coat the pieces as much as possible. Set aside.
Make the sauce: In a small-medium bowl, add all sauce ingredients and whisk until the cornstarch has dissolved. Set aside.
In a large sauté pan or wok, add the broccoli and 1/2 cup water. Turn the heat to high, cover and steam the broccoli for about 2 minutes until bright green and slightly softened. Then remove the broccoli to a plate nearby.
To the empty pan, add 1-3 tablespoons of oil, then add the soy curls and fry, stirring frequently for 4-5 minutes until a bit golden and crisp. I also like to add a few tablespoons of kitchen bouquet while frying, which helps make the soy curls nice and brown. Remove from the pan and set on a plate. You may omit the oil if you have a very good non-stick pan, otherwise the soy curls will stick. Turn the heat down to medium.
Whisk the sauce once more, then add to the pan with the soy curls. Stir constantly for a minute or two, until the sauce thickens, then add the broccoli back in and stir. Serve immediately over rice topped with sesame seeds and green onions. Enjoy!
