Ingredients:
3 cups canned chickpeas
1  clove of garlic
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 handfull fresh parsley ((blended together with the chickpeas))
1/2 cup fresh parsley, chopped ((added later on))
1/2 heaped cup walnuts, chopped
2 tablespoons spelt or whole wheat flour
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste
1 cup cranberries
2  pears, cut into medium-sized pieces
2 tablespoons brown sugar or coconut sugar
3/4 cup water

Instructions:
Put the chickpeas together with the garlic, the cumin, cilantro, and one handful of fresh parsley in a food processor and blend until you got a smooth mixture.
Put it in a bowl and stir in the chopped parsley, the walnuts, and the flour and season it with salt and black pepper. Stir with a wooden spoon until well combined.
Form about 15 balls and set aside.
Then make the cranberry pear dip. Put all ingredients into a small sauce pan and cook for about 15 minutes. The sauce is supposed to thicken to a jam-like consistency. Once it's ready, pour it into a blender and process until smooth.
While the cranberry sauce is cooking, heat some olive oil in a large frying pan. Make sure to use enough oil, so the falafel get crispy on the outside. Pan-fry them for about 5 minutes, flipping them over several times.
Serve the falafel together with the cranberry dip.
