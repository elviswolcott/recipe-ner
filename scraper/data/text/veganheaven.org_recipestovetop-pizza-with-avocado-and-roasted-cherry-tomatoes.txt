Ingredients:
2 1/2  cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon olive oil
2/3 cup lukewarm water
2  avocados, peeled and pitted
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon salt
12  cherry tomatoes, halved
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 splash of balsamic vinegar
freshly ground pepper to taste

Instructions:
For a quick yeast-free pizza dough, combine the all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Add the olive oil and water (little by little) and knead until a smooth dough forms. Note that you may not need all the water, or you may have to add a bit more to get a smooth, non-sticky dough. If the dough becomes too sticky, add a bit more flour. You can either knead it by hand or in a stand mixer.
Divide the dough into two pieces and roll them out on a floured surface. Put one pizza dough in a really hot flat pan for 1 to 2 minutes until golden on the bottom. Then, flip and let the other side get golden as well. Repeat for the other pizza.
Mash the avocados and mix them will lemon juice and salt in a bowl.
Roast the cherry tomato halves in a pan with olive oil on medium to high heat for a couple of minutes until warm, soft, and with a few brown spots. Add a splash of balsamic vinegar.
Spread the avocado mash on the pizza and top with the roasted cherry tomatoes. Add freshly ground pepper on top and enjoy!
