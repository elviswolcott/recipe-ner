Ingredients:
3  large tomatoes, diced
2  cloves of garlic, finely chopped
1/2  red onion, finely chopped
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1 cup fresh basil
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste
10 slices ciabatta bread, rustic bread, or baguette
1  clove of garlic
1/4 cup pine nuts

Instructions:
Wash and dice the tomatoes. Place them in a medium-sized bowl. Finely chop the red onion and add them to the tomatoes. 
Finely chop the garlic and add it as well. Either tear or chop the basil and add it to the mixture. 
Toast the pine nuts in a small skillet without oil. Cook them for about 3 minutes over medium heat, until fragrant and lightly browned. Add the olive oil to the tomato basil mixture and stir. Season with salt and pepper. 
Cut your bread into 1/2-inch thick slices. Heat a bit of olive oil in a pan (about 1-2 teaspoons) and cook it until crispy and golden. Alternatively, you could put the slices of bread on a grill.
