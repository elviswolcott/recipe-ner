Ingredients:
2 tsp oil (divided)
1/2  onion (thinly sliced)
4 cloves of garlic (finely chopped, or 1 tbsp mined)
1 tbsp finely chopped ginger
1 tbsp flour ((use rice flour for glutenfree))
2Â to 3 tsp garam masala (or 1.5 to 2 Tbsp Japanese Curry powder (omit turmeric if using))
3/4 tsp turmeric
1 1/4 cup chopped carrots
1  large potato cubed
15  oz can chickpeas (drained, or 1.5 cups cooked)
2 tsp tomato paste or ketchup
2 tsp vegan Worcestershire sauce or use soy(tamari for glutenfree) sauce ( or use coconut aminos for soyfree)
2 cups water
3/4 tsp salt
3 tbsp applesauce (or grated apple)
1/3 cup peas
scallions (pickled radish, pickled ginger and rice for serving)

Instructions:
Put the Instant pot on Saute. Add oil, when the oil is hot, add onion and pinch of salt and cook until translucent.
Add the garlic and ginger and mix in. Cook for half a minute.
Move the onions to the side. Add 1 tsp more oil to the pot, add the flour and mix into the oil. Then mix with the onion, ginger, garlic and cook for half a minute stirring frequently as the flour will tend to stick and burn if left too long. Add the spices and mix them in.&nbsp;
Add the veggies, chickpeas, sauces, salt and water. Mix really well to pick up the roasted flour from the bottom, so that none of the flour is sticking. Cancel Saute
Close the lid (sealing). Pressure Cook for 6 to 7 minutes (manual hi). (a minute longer if your veggies are chopped larger). Once the time is up. Click cancel and&nbsp;Let the pressure release naturally.&nbsp;
Open the lid. Put the pot on saute, add the applesauce and peas and bring to a boil. Taste and adjust salt, spice and flavor carefully. Add more spices to taste.&nbsp; Add some sweetener and good dash of black pepper or pepper flakes for heat if needed.&nbsp;Serve with rice and garnished with sesame seeds, pickled radish/ginger and scallions.
