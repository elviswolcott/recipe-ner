Ingredients:
1/4 cup quinoa (uncooked)
3/4 cup water
2 Tablespoons warm water
1.5 teaspoon active yeast
3/4  medium pear (chopped (about 3/4 cup))
1/4 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup bread flour
2/3 teaspoon salt
2 Tablespoons raw sugar
1/2 teaspoon chai spice (My chai spice blend recipe here)
1/2 teaspoon ginger powder

Instructions:
In a large bowl, add 2 Tablespoons warm water, yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar. Mix well and wait to get frothy(8-10 minutes)
Cook the Quinoa in 3/4 cup water, covered on low for 15 minutes or until tender. Or use scant 1 cup cooked quinoa.
Let the quinoa cool a little, then blend cooked quinoa, pear, spices, salt and rest of the sugar.
Add whole wheat flour, bread flour and this puree to the yeast mix and knead for 5-7 minutes. Add more bread flour or water if needed to get a soft dough. The dough might be slightly sticky.
Let dough sit in a well greased container, covered in a warm place until doubled(1.5 hours)
Take dough out and using a little bread flour, shape into a loaf or a jelly roll.
Place loaf or roll with seam side down in a greased or parchment lined regular size bread pan.
Spritz top with water and then with a little oil.
Cover with towel and let sit until doubled. (45 minutes)
Bake at 365 degrees F for 35-40 minutes until golden and a tap on the top sounds hollow.
Cool completely before slicing.
