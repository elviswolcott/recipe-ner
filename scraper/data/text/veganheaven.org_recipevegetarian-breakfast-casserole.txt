Ingredients:
5 medium potatoes (about 22 oz.) (If you want it to be faster, you can also use store-bought southern style hash browns instead.)
1 medium onion, chopped
salt, to taste
black pepper, to taste
1 teaspoon paprika powder
10 oz silken tofu
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon paprika powder
1 pinch kala namak
1 teaspoon turmeric
1 tablespoon corn starch
1 tablespoon fresh or frozen chives, cut into rings
1/2 cup vegan cheese
5 oz tempeh
1 tablespoon BBQ-sauce
1 teaspoon paprika powder
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon liquid smoke ((optional))
more vegan cheese to sprinkle on top
fresh chives
cherry tomatoes
green onions

Instructions:
Boil the unpeeled potatoes for about 15-20 minutes or until they're tender. Peel and cut them into cubes.
While the potatoes are boiling, make the BBQ tempeh "bacon": Cut the tempeh into small cubes. Heat some more oil in the pan you used for the potatoes and cook the remaining onions for about a minute. Add the tempeh and stir in the BBQ sauce, the paprika powder, the soy sauce, and if using the liquid smoke. Season with salt and pepper and cook for about 5 minutes. Set aside.
Heat some oil in a large pan and cook about half of the chopped onions for about 2 minutes or until translucent. Add the potatoes and season with paprika powder, salt, and pepper. Cook for about 5 minutes or until crispy and lightly brown. Set aside. If you want the recipe to be a bit quicker, you can also use store-bought southern style hash browns.
In a medium bowl, combine the silken tofu, the oil, the starch, the turmeric, the paprika powder and the kala namak. Whisk until smooth. Stir in the vegan cheese and the chives.
Fill the potatoes and the BBQ tempeh into a casserole dish and stir in the vegan egg-cheese mixture. Sprinkle with some more vegan cheese and bake for 15-20 minutes at 350 Â°F.
Serve with fresh chives, parsley, and cherry tomatoes.
