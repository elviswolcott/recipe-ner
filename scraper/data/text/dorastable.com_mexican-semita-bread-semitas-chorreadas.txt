Ingredients:
3 ½ cup Bread flour
½ cup Dark brown sugar
1 tsp. Ground anise seed
1 tsp Freshly ground cinnamon ((Ceylon))
1/3 cup Coconut butter, (about 3 oz)
1 ½ cups Warm water
½ cup Chopped pecans
½ cup Raisins, (soaked in the juice of one orange)
1 tsp. Orange zest
1 tsp. Active dry yeast
3.5 oz Piloncillo ((about ½ cup))
½ tsp. Salt

Instructions:
In a large bowl, mix all the dry ingredients flour, sugar, anise, cinnamon, yeast, and salt
Add the warm water and coconut butter to the bowl and knead.
I use the hook attachment on my mixer at medium-low speed for 4-6 minutes or until the dough has come off the sides of the bowl and is stretchy but not sticky.
If you don’t have a mixer you can knead by hand for 10 minutes or until you reach the desired consistency.
Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a kitchen towel and let rise for an hour.
To prepare your piloncillo, place it in a plastic bag, and crush it with the help of a hammer until finely ground.
Separate the crushed piloncillo un half. Place half of the piloncillo in a small bowl and mix with 1 tsp. Flour. This will be used to top the semitas before baking.
Once the dough is done rising, add the reaming half of the piloncillo, pecans, and orange zest and knead until all the ingredients are mixed evenly throughout.
Preheat oven to 350°F.
Divide the dough in four, roll the pieces tightly into rounds, and place on a sheet tray lined with parchment. Press down on the rounds lightly. Brush the rounds with your favorite plant milk, and top with the piloncillo and flour mixture. Press down slightly on the piloncillo topping with your hands.
Cover the sheet tray with a kitchen towel and let the dough rise for 20 minutes.
Bake for 20 minutes at 350°F.
