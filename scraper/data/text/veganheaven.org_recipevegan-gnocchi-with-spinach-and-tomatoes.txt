Ingredients:
1 17.6 OZ (500 g) package store-bought gnocchi (make sure to choose a vegan brand)
4 handful  fresh spinach
2  tomatoes, diced
1/2 cup cashews (unsalted and not roasted)
2 large  cloves of garlic
3 tablespoons nutritional yeast
2 teaspoons white miso paste
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon tapioca starch
1 cup unsweetened almond milk
black pepper

Instructions:
Prepare the gnocchi according to the instructions on the package. Place the spinach in a colander and drain the gnocchi over it (this is an easy trick to wilt fresh spinach).
Make the sauce: place all ingredients in a high speed blender and process until smooth.
Pour the sauce into a large pot and heat until it thickens up. Add the gnocchi, the spinach, and the diced tomatoes. Cook for another minute.
