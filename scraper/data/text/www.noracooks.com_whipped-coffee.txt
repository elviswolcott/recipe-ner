Ingredients:
4 tablespoons instant coffee
4 tablespoons granulated sugar
4 tablespoons boiling hot water
2 cups milk of choice, warm or cold

Instructions:
Add the instant coffee granules, sugar and hot water to a medium sized mixing bowl.
Using a hand mixer, start mixing the ingredients on low speed. After a minute or so, it will grow in size and begin to get fluffy. At this point, increase the speed to medium and beat in a zig-zag motion until very fluffy with peaks.
For iced whipped coffee: In a glass, add a few cubes of ice and fill about 2/3 of the way full with milk of choice (I like oat milk). Add some whipped coffee on top of the milk, stir and enjoy immediately.
For warm whipped coffee: Steam or simply warm about 1 cup of milk (microwave works fine), then add a good serving of the whipped coffee on top and stir it into the milk. Enjoy.
*Some recipes don&#39;t make it clear that you should stir the whipped coffee mixture into milk, but that is exactly what you should do for best results. It&#39;s quite strong on it&#39;s own, but tastes perfect once you stir it in. It will maintain the fluffiness even once stirred in, making it a delicious and unusual drink.
