Ingredients:
14 ounces firm or extra firm tofu pressed for at least 15 minutes and cubed
1 teaspoon soy sauce or use tamari for gluten-free
1 teaspoon oil
2 teaspoons smoked paprika
2 teaspoons onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon cayenne or chili powder blend
1/2 teaspoon of salt
1/2 teaspoon of black pepper
1 teaspoon oil

A good pinch of salt and pepper
1 tablespoon BBQ sauce

lime juice as needed
2 cups of chopped lettuce or cabbage as needed

tortillas as needed (Glutenfree as desired )

Instructions:
Press and cube the tofu if you haven&#39;t already. Then add to a bowl. Add the soy sauce and 1 teaspoon oil and toss well to coat.
In another small shallow bowl, mix all the spices then sprinkle the spices over the tofu and toss well to coat.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat.Add 2 teaspoons of oil and let the oil heat up then add in your spiced tofu.
Cook for 7-10 minutes or until the tofu is golden, is crispy on most of the edges.
You might want to be careful with the end of cooking so as to not burn the spices.
Make the BBQ onions: Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and a pinch of salt and pepper and cook until the onion is golden. 7-8 mins. Stir occasionally.
Then add in your BBQ sauce and hot sauce and toss well to coat then take off heat.
To assemble tacos, warm your tortillas on a gas stove or a pan then layer a layer of lettuce. Add a good helping of the tofu.
Squeeze some lime juice over the tofu then top it with the BBQ onions, more lettuce, and vegan ranch, or sour cream as needed.
Repeat for all your tacos and serve immediately.
