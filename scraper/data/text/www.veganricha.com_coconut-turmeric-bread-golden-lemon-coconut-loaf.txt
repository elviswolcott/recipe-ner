Ingredients:
1 cup non dairy milk  (, such as almond or lite coconut)
1/2 cup maple syrup
2 tbsp sugar ((for sweeter cake))
1 cup coconut flakes
1 tsp vanilla extract
juice of 1 lime (2 to 3 tbsp lime or lemon juice)
1.5 cups flour ((I use 1 cup unbleached all purpose and 1/2 cup whole grain wheat or spelt or more of unbleached flour))
2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/3 tsp salt
1 tsp turmeric
1/8 to 1/4 tsp black pepper
1/4  tsp cinnamon or nutmeg  ((optional))

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a loaf pan with parchment or grease well.
Blend all ingredients under wet so that coconut flakes breaks down a bit. to very small flakes.&nbsp;
In a bowl mix all the dry ingredients really well,
Combine wet and dry and mix to form a batter. Transfer the thick batter to a loaf pan. Sprinkle a tbsp or so coconut on top and Bake for 45 mins or until a toothpick from the center comes out clean.&nbsp;
Cool for 10 mins then remove from loaf and cool completely. I usually cool the loaf, then refrigerate for an hour or so then slice.
