Ingredients:
2 cups whole wheat flour
2 cups bread flour
1/2 cup multigrain cereal
2 teaspoon raw sugar
1.5 teaspoons active yeast
2/3 cup of water
1/2 cup blueberry compote
1/2 cup orange juice
1 tablespoon vegan butter
1  flax egg
1/2 teaspoon salt

Instructions:
Boil the water and add cereal to it. Cook for 5 minutes then cool to a warm 110. Add the yeast and mix well. Let stand for 10 minutes or until frothy.
In the mixer bowl add the flours, salt and mix well
Add in the yeast mixture, softened butter, egg, blueberry compote and half of the orange juice.
Knead the dough for 8-10 minutes, scraping sides every 2-3 minutes. add more flour or orange juice in little quantities if needed.
Place dough in a covered container in a warm place for 1.5-2 hours. Spritz the top of dough with some oil spray.
Punch it lightly and shape into a loaf by pulling on all sides, or by rolling it out into a rectangle and rolling the rectangle from one side and tucking the edges under.
Place loaf in greased bread pan. Spritz the top with a little oil spray and cover with damp towel.
Place it in a warm place or warm oven for about an hour.
Remove towel, spritz top with some water and bake at 375 degrees F for 40-45 minutes.
Remove bread from pan and let cool for atleast an hour.
I usually refrigerate it for another hour before slicing. The breads are usually quite fluffy and soft and refrigeration makes them a bit firm for nice and clean slices!
