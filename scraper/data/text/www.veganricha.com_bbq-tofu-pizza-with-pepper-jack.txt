Ingredients:
1/4 cup + 2 Tbsp warm hot water
1 tsp maple syrup
2 tsp active yeast
3/4 cup spelt flour
1 Tbsp cornstarch  (or arrow root starch)
1/3 tsp salt
2 tsp extra virgin olive oil
2 Tbsp BBQ sauce. Use my soy free BBQ sauce recipe and Chickpea Tofu to make the pizza soy-free.
2 -3 tsp sriracha or other chili sauce
1/2 tsp garlic powder or garlic paste
1 cup cubed firm or super firm tofu (pressed)
sliced onions
sliced red bell peppers
pasta/marinara sauce or use more bbq sauce as base
Use my Almond Milk Pepper Jack (or other vegan cheese shreds)

Instructions:
Marinate the bbq Tofu: Press the tofu in paper towels well by hand or keep pressed in kitchen towel under a 10 lb weight for 15 mins. Add the sauces, garlic and pressed tofu in a bowl and let sit until ready to use.
Make the Pizza dough: In a bowl, add water, yeast, maple. Mix and let sit for 5 minutes or until frothy. in another bowl, add the dry ingredients. Mix well and add to the yeast mixture. Add oil if using, mix and knead for 2 minutes or until smooth. Roll the dough out on parchment using a little flour if needed into a 12 to 13 inch oval. (roll it out using a rolling pin. Spelt dough does not work well with stretching like a regular pizza dough). Let rest near the oven (for at least 10 mins) while you preheat it to 450 degrees F / 230ºc
Prep the veggies and get the sauce and other ingredients ready. Spread marinara on the shaped dough. Layer the onions, peppers, other veggies. Sprinkle salt and pepper. Add marinated tofu. Drizzle any leftover sriracha bbq sauce over the tofu. Add enough shredded Pepper Jack.
Bake at pre-heated 450 deg F / 230ºc for 12 to 14 mins. Take the pizza out. Sprinkle chopped cilantro, slice and serve!
Variations: bake the marinated tofu for 20 minutes until crispy and then add to the pizza.
