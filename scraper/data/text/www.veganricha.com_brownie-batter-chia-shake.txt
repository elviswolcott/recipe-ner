Ingredients:
1 cup non dairy milk (I use almond milk)
1 to 1.5 tbsp chia seeds
1 tbsp cocoa powder
2 tbsp vegan chocolate chips
1/4 tsp vanilla extract
1/4 tsp or more orange zest
1/8 tsp salt
2 tsp or more sugar  (or coconut sugar or maple if using unsweetened non dairy milk)
melted vegan chocolate  (or chocolate syrup)
vegan chocolate chips for garnish

Instructions:
Blend the first 7 ingredients until smooth. I blended two one minute cycles. Taste and adjust sweet and flavor and blend again. You might need any sugar or sweetener. Add 1 to 2 tsp flour of choice for a more batter like flavor.
Melt 1 tbsp vegan chocolate on a double boiler with 2 tsp of non dairy milk. whisk until smooth. Drizzle on the inside of the serving glass. Or use a chocolate syrup of choice.
Chill the glass for a few minutes. Add the blended shake. Chill for 15 minutes or overnight and serve topped with chocolate chips, vanilla ice cream or other toppings.
