Ingredients:
3 oz. Almond butter ((1/3 cup))
1 oz Apple sauce ((2 tbsp.))
4 oz All-purpose flour ((1 cup))
2 oz Whole wheat flour ((½ cup))
1/2 tsp. Salt
1/2 tbsp. Sugar
4 tbsp. Water (ice cold)
2 cups Sweet Potato puree
8 oz Silken tofu ((1 cup))
1/2 cup Soy milk (unsweetened)
1/2 cup Coconut sugar or brown sugar
½ cup Maple syrup
3 tbsp. Corn starch
1/4 tsp. Ground nutmeg
1 tsp. Ground Cinnamon
1/4 tsp. Ground clove
1/4 tsp Ground ginger
1 tsp. Vanilla extract

Instructions:
In a small bowl, combine the apple sauce and almond butter. Spread this mixture on a paper plate or similar container, and place in the freezer until it hardens. In a large bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, salt, and sugar. Mix to combine.
Add the frozen almond butter to the flour mixture, and using a pastry cutter or your hands cut the almond butter into the flour, until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Slowly add the water, and using a spatula work it into the flour mixture. Knead the dough briefly until it comes together and forms into a ball. Place in the fridge for 30 min.
Preheat oven to 350°F.
In the blender, place the sweet potato puree, tofu, soy milk, coconut sugar, maple syrup, cornstarch, nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, ginger, vanilla, and process until smooth. Set aside.
On a lightly floured surface roll out the pie dough to form a 12 inch circle ¼ inch thick. Place the rolled out dough in the pie pan carefully and smooth it out. With a small knife, trim the extra overhang of the crust. Crimp the edges with a fork or flute the edges with your fingers,
Pour in the sweet potato mixture and using a spatula smooth it out to make it as even as possible. Tent the edges of the pie with foil to prevent excess browning.
Bake for 35 – 40 minutes or until the center of the pie is almost set. Remove from the oven and let cool completely for at least 3 hours. Store pie in refrigerator.
