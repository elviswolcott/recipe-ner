["Ingredients:\n1/2 cup vegan cream cheese ((I use kite hill almond plain) Or Use cashew cream or vegan yogurt)\n1/2 cup + 2 tbsp non dairy milk\n3 tbsp oil (or use more non dairy milk)\n2 tbsp maple syrup (or use 2 tbsp sugar + 1 tbsp non dairy milk)\n1/3 cup vegan sugar\n1 tsp vanilla extract\n1.5 cups flour ((I use a combination of unbleached all purpose and whole wheat))\n2 tsp baking powder\n1/8 tsp salt\n1/2 cup wild blueberries ((frozen or fresh))\n1/2 cup chopped pineapple (or use 1/4 cup more berries)\n\nInstructions:\nLine a muffin pan. Preheat the oven to 365 degrees F(185 C). Blend the wet ingredients in a blender with 1/2 cup non dairy milk. Add to a bowl. Use 2 tbsp more dairy milk to rinse out the blender and add to the bowl. (or add all the wet ingredients to a bowl, mix with a spoon until smooth and well combined)\nAdd 1 cup flour, salt, baking powder to a bowl, mix well. (You can add spices/flavors at this point like cinnamon, nutmeg or some lemon zest). Add to the wet.\nIn the same dry bowl, add 1/2 cup flour, blueberries and pineapple and toss to coat. Add to the wet bowl and mix in. The batter should be thick and stiff. If it is too stiff, add a tbsp of non dairy milk and mix in.&nbsp;\nDrop the thick batter onto lined muffin pan. Bake at 365 degrees F for 22 to 25 mins. (To bake a loaf, bake for 40 to 50 mins)\nCool completely and frost or glaze. I use this cashew vanilla frosting. A simple vanilla or lemon icing will work well too. Store on the counter for a few hours and refrigerate for upto 3 days. This muffin also does well with a cinnamon streusel topping. The muffin tastes more cheesecakey after sitting for a day.&nbsp;", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 39, "INGREDIENT"], [79, 94, "INGREDIENT"], [101, 107, "INGREDIENT"], [109, 116, "QUANTITY"], [117, 140, "INGREDIENT"], [141, 147, "QUANTITY"], [148, 151, "INGREDIENT"], [165, 179, "INGREDIENT"], [181, 187, "QUANTITY"], [188, 199, "INGREDIENT"], [208, 214, "QUANTITY"], [215, 220, "INGREDIENT"], [221, 244, "INGREDIENT"], [246, 253, "QUANTITY"], [254, 265, "INGREDIENT"], [266, 271, "QUANTITY"], [272, 287, "INGREDIENT"], [297, 302, "INGREDIENT"], [355, 366, "INGREDIENT"], [369, 374, "QUANTITY"], [375, 388, "INGREDIENT"], [389, 396, "QUANTITY"], [397, 401, "INGREDIENT"], [402, 409, "QUANTITY"], [410, 426, "INGREDIENT"], [429, 435, "INGREDIENT"], [439, 444, "INGREDIENT"], [447, 454, "QUANTITY"], [455, 472, "INGREDIENT"], [481, 488, "QUANTITY"], [623, 630, "QUANTITY"], [631, 645, "INGREDIENT"], [666, 672, "QUANTITY"], [684, 688, "INGREDIENT"], [718, 721, "PROCESS"], [739, 742, "PROCESS"], [778, 781, "PROCESS"], [831, 836, "QUANTITY"], [837, 842, "INGREDIENT"], [844, 848, "INGREDIENT"], [850, 863, "INGREDIENT"], [875, 878, "PROCESS"], [890, 893, "INGREDIENT"], [894, 897, "PROCESS"], [932, 940, "INGREDIENT"], [942, 948, "INGREDIENT"], [957, 967, "INGREDIENT"], [1008, 1011, "PROCESS"], [1012, 1019, "QUANTITY"], [1020, 1025, "INGREDIENT"], [1027, 1038, "INGREDIENT"], [1043, 1052, "INGREDIENT"], [1095, 1098, "PROCESS"], [1161, 1164, "PROCESS"], [1175, 1189, "INGREDIENT"], [1194, 1197, "PROCESS"], [1298, 1302, "PROCESS"], [1311, 1315, "PROCESS"], [1389, 1396, "INGREDIENT"], [1416, 1423, "INGREDIENT"], [1563, 1571, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
