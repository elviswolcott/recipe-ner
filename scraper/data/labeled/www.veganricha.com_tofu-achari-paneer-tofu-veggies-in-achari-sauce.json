Mix in the pepper flakes and take off heat. Pulse once in a blender or use a mortar and pestle to break some of the spices. Reserve 1/2 tsp of the mix for garnish.\nPrep the tofu. You can use just pressed tofu, or&nbsp;crisped in oil for a few mins, or baked with spices like my Butter tofu.\nHeat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and a pinch of salt and cook until golden. Pulse the garlic, ginger and chile in a blender with a tbsp of water to make a paste. Add the paste to the onion skillet. Alternatively, mince them and add to the onion.\nCook for a minute. Add the Achari spice mix(from step 1), coriander, turmeric&nbsp; and mix in.

[Add some garam masala for added flavor if needed or add 1-2 tsp mango pickle minus the mango at this point add some esp if omitting some of the spices or for some more flavor burst)]. Add broccoli and mix in. Reduce heat to medium low, Cover and cook for 3 minutes so broccoli is well steamed but not mushy. Uncover and cook for another minute to reduce sauce if needed. Take off heat.&nbsp;\nGarnish with the reserved achari spices, more nigella seeds (and some cayenne for additional heat) and cilantro. Serve with flatbread or with rice or grains.", {"entities": [[13, 18, "QUANTITY"], [19, 30, "INGREDIENT"], [31, 38, "QUANTITY"], [39, 60, "INGREDIENT"], [61, 68, "QUANTITY"], [69, 86, "INGREDIENT"], [87, 91, "QUANTITY"], [92, 96, "INGREDIENT"], [100, 107, "PROCESS"], [112, 117, "INGREDIENT"], [119, 124, "QUANTITY"], [125, 128, "INGREDIENT"], [138, 158, "INGREDIENT"], [161, 167, "INGREDIENT"], [171, 177, "INGREDIENT"], [188, 194, "INGREDIENT"], [200, 206, "QUANTITY"], [207, 213, "INGREDIENT"], [237, 242, "INGREDIENT"], [279, 296, "INGREDIENT"], [298, 303, "QUANTITY"], [304, 320, "INGREDIENT"], [321, 328, "QUANTITY"], [329, 336, "INGREDIENT"], [337, 344, "QUANTITY"], [345, 353, "INGREDIENT"], [363, 371, "INGREDIENT"], [384, 390, "INGREDIENT"], [391, 398, "QUANTITY"], [399, 403, "INGREDIENT"], [404, 409, "QUANTITY"], [410, 424, "INGREDIENT"], [425, 432, "QUANTITY"], [433, 449, "INGREDIENT"], [459, 475, "INGREDIENT"], [479, 491, "INGREDIENT"], [502, 509, "QUANTITY"], [510, 517, "INGREDIENT"], [531, 538, "QUANTITY"], [539, 544, "INGREDIENT"], [546, 553, "QUANTITY"], [554, 559, "INGREDIENT"], [560, 566, "QUANTITY"], [567, 611, "INGREDIENT"], [615, 623, "INGREDIENT"], [631, 638, "INGREDIENT"], [641, 645, "INGREDIENT"], [657, 664, "QUANTITY"], [665, 678, "INGREDIENT"], [702, 722, "INGREDIENT"], [763, 780, "INGREDIENT"], [835, 847, "INGREDIENT"], [882, 895, "INGREDIENT"], [1003, 1010, "QUANTITY"], [1018, 1021, "PROCESS"], [1044, 1048, "INGREDIENT"], [1054, 1057, "INGREDIENT"], [1067, 1074, "PROCESS"], [1075, 1079, "INGREDIENT"], [1100, 1103, "INGREDIENT"], [1123, 1128, "PROCESS"], [1156, 1160, "INGREDIENT"], [1167, 1170, "INGREDIENT"], [1206, 1211, "INGREDIENT"], [1218, 1231, "INGREDIENT"], [1236, 1240, "PROCESS"], [1265, 1271, "INGREDIENT"], [1273, 1279, "INGREDIENT"], [1315, 1323, "INGREDIENT"], [1334, 1339, "INGREDIENT"], [1349, 1354, "INGREDIENT"], [1362, 1367, "INGREDIENT"], [1407, 1410, "PROCESS"], [1418, 1423, "INGREDIENT"], [1459, 1464, "INGREDIENT"], [1483, 1492, "INGREDIENT"], [1513, 1516, "PROCESS"], [1576, 1584, "INGREDIENT"], [1602, 1605, "PROCESS"], [1640, 1656, "INGREDIENT"], [1673, 1679, "INGREDIENT"], [1696, 1703, "PROCESS"], [1709, 1713, "INGREDIENT"], [1715, 1720, "INGREDIENT"], [1725, 1741, "INGREDIENT"], [1746, 1749, "PROCESS"], [1758, 1763, "INGREDIENT"], [1765, 1769, "INGREDIENT"], [1771, 1778, "INGREDIENT"], [1787, 1795, "INGREDIENT"], [1801, 1804, "PROCESS"], [1819, 1823, "PROCESS"], [1857, 1861, "INGREDIENT"], [1890, 1902, "INGREDIENT"], [1907, 1912, "PROCESS"], [1933, 1936, "PROCESS"], [1939, 1944, "QUANTITY"], [1988, 1991, "PROCESS"], [2069, 2077, "INGREDIENT"], [2082, 2085, "PROCESS"], [2127, 2131, "PROCESS"], [2149, 2157, "INGREDIENT"], [2166, 2173, "PROCESS"], [2201, 2205, "PROCESS"], [2319, 2332, "INGREDIENT"], [2343, 2350, "INGREDIENT"], [2376, 2384, "INGREDIENT"], [2415, 2419, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
