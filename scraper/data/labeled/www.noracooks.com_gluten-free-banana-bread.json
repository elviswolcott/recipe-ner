["Ingredients:\n3 large ripe bananas (1 1/2 cups mashed)\n1/2 cup melted vegan butter or coconut oil\n3/4 cup granulated sugar\n2 tablespoons soy milk  (or other plant milk)\n2 cups gluten free 1:1 flour* (I used Bob&#039;s Red Mill 1:1)\n1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n3/4 cup chopped walnuts or non-dairy chocolate chips, optional\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F and grease a standard loaf pan (8 1/2 x 4 1/2 inches or 9 x 5 inches.)\nIn a large bowl, mash the bananas with a fork until smooth. Scoop it into a measuring cup to make sure you have about 1 1/2 cups mashed, then return it to the bowl.\nNow add the melted vegan butter, sugar and soy milk. Stir with a large spoon until well combined.\nAdd the flour to the bowl with the wet ingredients, then sprinkle the baking powder, baking soda and salt on top of the flour. Stir gently until just combined, making sure you don&#039;t over mix. If you over mix, your bread will come out dense.\nGently fold in the walnuts or chocolate chips, if using. Pour into the prepared pan, place in the center rack of the oven and bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.\nLet it cool in the pan for a few minutes, then transfer the loaf to a cooling rack. Let the banana bread cool for at least 30 minutes if possible, as this will make it easier to slice. Serve and enjoy!\nCover leftover banana bread and store at room temperature for 1-2 days, or the refrigerator for up to 1 week. It also freezes well.", {"entities": [[35, 45, "QUANTITY"], [46, 52, "INGREDIENT"], [54, 61, "QUANTITY"], [62, 96, "INGREDIENT"], [97, 104, "QUANTITY"], [105, 121, "INGREDIENT"], [122, 135, "QUANTITY"], [136, 144, "INGREDIENT"], [156, 166, "INGREDIENT"], [168, 174, "QUANTITY"], [175, 197, "INGREDIENT"], [231, 246, "QUANTITY"], [247, 260, "INGREDIENT"], [261, 273, "QUANTITY"], [274, 285, "INGREDIENT"], [286, 298, "QUANTITY"], [299, 303, "INGREDIENT"], [304, 311, "QUANTITY"], [312, 366, "INGREDIENT"], [573, 576, "QUANTITY"], [605, 615, "QUANTITY"], [616, 622, "INGREDIENT"], [656, 659, "PROCESS"], [664, 683, "INGREDIENT"], [685, 690, "INGREDIENT"], [695, 703, "INGREDIENT"], [758, 763, "INGREDIENT"], [807, 815, "PROCESS"], [820, 833, "INGREDIENT"], [835, 846, "INGREDIENT"], [851, 855, "INGREDIENT"], [870, 875, "INGREDIENT"], [942, 945, "PROCESS"], [959, 962, "PROCESS"], [1015, 1022, "INGREDIENT"], [1026, 1041, "INGREDIENT"], [1081, 1086, "PROCESS"], [1122, 1126, "PROCESS"]]}]
