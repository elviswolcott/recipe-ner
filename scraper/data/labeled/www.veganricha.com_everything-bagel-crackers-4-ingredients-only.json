["Ingredients:\n1 cup whole wheat pastry flour (or use a mix of all-purpose and wheat flour)\n1/4 tsp salt\n2 tbsp everything but the bagel seasoning\n2 tbsp neutral oil (or softened vegan butter )\n3-5 tbsp cold water\n\nInstructions:\nIn a bowl, mix in the flour, salt, and seasoning. Combine well.\nAdd in the oil and mix in, so that it is evenly distributed in the dry mixture, and there are some crumbs of the flour.\nAdd in the water 1-2 tbsp at a time, and make a dough that is not too sticky. You don&#039;t want to add too much water and keep the dough on the slightly hard side.\nOnce the dough comes together, let it sit for 5 minutes, then knead again to make it a bit smooth, then roll it out between two parchment sheets to 1-2 millimeters thick.\nUsing a pizza cutter or sharp knife, score the rolled out dough, then transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet, bake at 300 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 minutes, then check. Move some of the crackers around and bake more if needed.\nI like to bake it with the fan on, but if you dont have fan that works as well.", {"entities": [[13, 18, "QUANTITY"], [19, 43, "INGREDIENT"], [54, 57, "PROCESS"], [77, 88, "INGREDIENT"], [90, 97, "QUANTITY"], [98, 102, "INGREDIENT"], [103, 109, "QUANTITY"], [110, 144, "INGREDIENT"], [145, 151, "QUANTITY"], [152, 163, "INGREDIENT"], [168, 189, "INGREDIENT"], [194, 200, "QUANTITY"], [201, 211, "INGREDIENT"], [238, 241, "PROCESS"], [249, 254, "INGREDIENT"], [256, 260, "INGREDIENT"], [302, 305, "INGREDIENT"], [310, 313, "PROCESS"], [404, 409, "INGREDIENT"], [422, 427, "INGREDIENT"], [430, 436, "QUANTITY"], [512, 515, "PROCESS"], [525, 530, "INGREDIENT"], [639, 644, "PROCESS"], [848, 854, "PROCESS"], [862, 866, "PROCESS"], [958, 962, "PROCESS"], [989, 993, "PROCESS"]]}]
