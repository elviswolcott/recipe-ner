["Ingredients:\n16 ounces extra-firm tofu\n4 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce\n3 tablespoons rice vinegar\n1 tablespoon pure maple syrup\n1 teaspoon sesame oil\n2  garlic cloves, minced\n1 tablespoon fresh grated ginger, OR 1/2 teaspoon dried ginger\n2-3 tablespoons neutral oil, such as canola\n\nInstructions:\nQuick press the tofu: Cut the tofu into cubes. Place them evenly on a flat surface such as a cutting board lined with paper towels or a clean towel. Cover with a layer of paper towels, set a baking sheet on top and then something heavy, like a large book or cast iron skillet. Press like this for 15 minutes while you make the marinade.&nbsp;\nMake the marinade: In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, rice vinegar, maple syrup, sesame oil, garlic and ginger.&nbsp;\nMarinate the tofu: Place the pressed tofu pieces in a shallow dish. (In the photos above I doubled the recipe, so I used a 9 x 13 inch dish, but for one batch you will need a smaller dish, such as an 8 x 8 inch.) Pour the marinade over the tofu. Let it marinate for at least 1 hour, covered, in the refrigerator. If you want to leave it overnight, it will be even more flavorful.\nCook the tofu: In a large skillet, cast iron preferred, add a few tablespoons of a neutral oil, such as canola oil and heat over medium-high heat. You can omit the oil if needed, but you will need a very good non-stick pan so the tofu pieces don't stick. Remove the tofu pieces from the marinade and add to the pan. Do not discard the marinade sauce. Fry the tofu until golden brown on each side.\nOnce the tofu pieces are browned, pour any leftover marinade sauce into the pan with the tofu, and stir to coat. This makes the tofu even more flavorful! The tofu will quickly absorb the sauce. Remove from heat, and serve with rice and stir fried vegetables such as baby bok choy, mushrooms and carrots.\nStore leftover tofu in a covered container in the refrigerator for 3-4 days. It's also good cold, as a high protein snack or in sandwiches and salads.", {"entities": [[13, 22, "QUANTITY"], [23, 38, "INGREDIENT"], [39, 52, "QUANTITY"], [53, 73, "INGREDIENT"], [74, 87, "QUANTITY"], [88, 100, "INGREDIENT"], [101, 113, "QUANTITY"], [114, 130, "INGREDIENT"], [131, 141, "QUANTITY"], [142, 152, "INGREDIENT"], [156, 162, "INGREDIENT"], [163, 169, "INGREDIENT"], [171, 177, "INGREDIENT"], [178, 190, "QUANTITY"], [191, 240, "INGREDIENT"], [243, 256, "QUANTITY"], [257, 284, "INGREDIENT"], [306, 311, "PROCESS"], [316, 320, "INGREDIENT"], [330, 334, "INGREDIENT"], [491, 497, "PROCESS"], [691, 701, "INGREDIENT"], [702, 714, "INGREDIENT"], [716, 727, "INGREDIENT"], [729, 739, "INGREDIENT"], [741, 747, "INGREDIENT"], [779, 783, "INGREDIENT"], [795, 802, "PROCESS"], [803, 807, "INGREDIENT"], [1006, 1010, "INGREDIENT"], [1155, 1159, "INGREDIENT"], [1202, 1205, "PROCESS"], [1229, 1256, "INGREDIENT"], [1257, 1260, "INGREDIENT"], [1297, 1300, "INGREDIENT"], [1310, 1313, "INGREDIENT"], [1376, 1380, "INGREDIENT"], [1412, 1416, "INGREDIENT"], [1446, 1449, "PROCESS"], [1505, 1509, "INGREDIENT"], [1532, 1536, "INGREDIENT"], [1552, 1556, "INGREDIENT"], [1632, 1636, "INGREDIENT"], [1642, 1646, "PROCESS"], [1671, 1675, "INGREDIENT"], [1701, 1705, "INGREDIENT"], [1770, 1774, "INGREDIENT"], [1779, 1783, "PROCESS"], [1784, 1789, "PROCESS"], [1790, 1800, "INGREDIENT"], [1814, 1822, "INGREDIENT"], [1824, 1833, "INGREDIENT"], [1838, 1845, "INGREDIENT"], [1862, 1866, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
