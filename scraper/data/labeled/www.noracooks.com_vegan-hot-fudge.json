["Ingredients:\n1 can (13.5 oz) coconut cream\n1/2 cup light corn syrup* (or brown rice syrup)\n1/3 cup brown sugar, packed\n1/8 teaspoon salt\n4 tablespoons vegan butter\n6 ounces vegan chocolate, finely chopped\n4 tablespoons natural cocoa powder, sifted\n2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract\n\nInstructions:\nIn a small pot (1 1/2 quarts), combine the coconut cream, corn syrup, brown sugar, salt and vegan butter. Warm over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the butter melts and the mixture begins to simmer.\nSimmer for 1 minute, then reduce the heat to low-medium and stir in the chocolate until it melts.\nRemove from heat and whisk the cocoa powder in until smooth.\nReturn the pot to heat (still low-medium) and cook for just about 30 seconds more, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and let cool. It will thicken as it cools so don&#39;t worry if it&#39;s not super thick right away.\nStore leftover fudge sauce in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. You can reheat it in the microwave for 20-30 seconds or until warm, or reheat on the stovetop in a small pan.", {"entities": [[15, 18, "INGREDIENT"], [29, 42, "INGREDIENT"], [43, 50, "QUANTITY"], [51, 68, "INGREDIENT"], [73, 89, "INGREDIENT"], [91, 98, "QUANTITY"], [99, 118, "INGREDIENT"], [119, 131, "QUANTITY"], [132, 136, "INGREDIENT"], [137, 150, "QUANTITY"], [151, 163, "INGREDIENT"], [164, 172, "QUANTITY"], [173, 204, "INGREDIENT"], [205, 218, "QUANTITY"], [219, 247, "INGREDIENT"], [248, 259, "QUANTITY"], [260, 280, "INGREDIENT"], [312, 324, "QUANTITY"], [339, 352, "INGREDIENT"], [354, 358, "INGREDIENT"], [366, 377, "INGREDIENT"], [379, 383, "INGREDIENT"], [388, 400, "INGREDIENT"], [425, 433, "PROCESS"], [456, 462, "INGREDIENT"], [563, 567, "PROCESS"], [575, 584, "INGREDIENT"], [622, 627, "PROCESS"], [632, 644, "INGREDIENT"], [708, 712, "PROCESS"], [745, 753, "PROCESS"], [979, 982, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
