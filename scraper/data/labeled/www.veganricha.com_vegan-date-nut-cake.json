Mix until well combined and the sugar is well dissolved.\nIn another bowl, add the flours, almond flour, nuts, baking powder, baking soda, salt and mix well.\nThen add in the dates and mix in.\nTransfer the dry to the wet mixture and mix until well combined.\nYou should get a somewhat thick, muffin-like batter. If it is too thin, you can add in 1-3 tablespoons of more flour. If it is too thick, you can add in a few teaspoons of non-dairy milk and mix in.\nLine an 8 x 8-inch brownie pan or a 9 x 5-inch loaf pan with parchment. Transfer the batter to the pan. Even on the batter first with a spatula. Then top the batter with pecans and sugar.\nBake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180c) for 30 minutes for the 8x8 inch brownie pan and 40 minutes or longer for a loaf fan.\nCheck with a toothpick from the middle. It should come out clean. Else bake 5-10 mins longer.\nCool in the pan for 10 minutes and remove from the pan.
