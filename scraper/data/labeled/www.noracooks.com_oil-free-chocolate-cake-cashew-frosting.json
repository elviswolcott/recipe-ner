["Ingredients:\n1 cup white whole wheat flour\n1/2 cup coconut sugar, or regular sugar\n1/4 cup cocoa powder\n1 teaspoon baking powder\n1/4 teaspoon baking soda\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/3 cup non-dairy chocolate chips, optional\n3/4 cup cooked and peeled sweet potato, see notes\n1/2 cup almond milk\n1/2 tablespoon apple cider vinegar\n2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract\n1/2 cup non-dairy yogurt, plain or vanilla\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly spray a 9 inch cake pan with oil, using as little as possible. You can also cut a circle of parchment paper to fit the bottom of the pan. This will make it easier to pop the cake out when it's done.\nAdd all dry ingredients, including chocolate chips, in a large bowl and stir to combine.\nIn a blender, add the cooked and cooled sweet potato, almond milk, apple cider vinegar and pure vanilla extract. Blend until very smooth.\nAdd the blended mixture to the dry ingredients, and also dump in the non-dairy yogurt. Stir with a wooden spoon until just combined, being careful not to over mix.\nAdd the cake batter to the pan, spreading it evenly with a spatula.\nBake for 25-30 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean.\nLet cool completely before frosting (recipe below.)", {"entities": [[13, 18, "QUANTITY"], [19, 42, "INGREDIENT"], [43, 50, "QUANTITY"], [51, 82, "INGREDIENT"], [83, 90, "QUANTITY"], [91, 103, "INGREDIENT"], [104, 114, "QUANTITY"], [115, 128, "INGREDIENT"], [129, 141, "QUANTITY"], [142, 153, "INGREDIENT"], [154, 166, "QUANTITY"], [167, 171, "INGREDIENT"], [172, 179, "QUANTITY"], [180, 215, "INGREDIENT"], [216, 223, "QUANTITY"], [224, 265, "INGREDIENT"], [270, 285, "INGREDIENT"], [286, 300, "QUANTITY"], [301, 320, "INGREDIENT"], [321, 332, "QUANTITY"], [333, 353, "INGREDIENT"], [354, 361, "QUANTITY"], [362, 396, "INGREDIENT"], [478, 481, "INGREDIENT"], [516, 519, "INGREDIENT"], [683, 698, "INGREDIENT"], [720, 724, "PROCESS"], [751, 754, "PROCESS"], [759, 765, "PROCESS"], [777, 789, "INGREDIENT"], [791, 803, "INGREDIENT"], [804, 823, "INGREDIENT"], [828, 848, "INGREDIENT"], [932, 936, "PROCESS"], [944, 960, "INGREDIENT"], [1034, 1037, "PROCESS"]]}]
