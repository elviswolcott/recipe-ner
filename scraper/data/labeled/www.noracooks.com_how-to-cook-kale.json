["Ingredients:\n10 ounce bag chopped kale (or 1 large bunch kale, washed and chopped)\n1 cup water\n\nInstructions:\nPour the water into the inner cooking pot of the Instant Pot.&nbsp;\nAdd the chopped kale. Don't worry if there are some stems, the Instant Pot will make them edible and not too chewy.&nbsp;\nPlace the lid on, set the valve to seal and cook on high, manual pressure for 3 minutes.\nOnce it beeps, you can either do a quick pressure release or let it naturally release (usually this takes about 10 minutes).\nServe in hearty rice and bean bowls, or on the side of any meal. Sprinkle with salt or balsamic vinegar. It's also particularly good with cashew cream.", {"entities": [[13, 21, "QUANTITY"], [22, 38, "INGREDIENT"], [57, 61, "INGREDIENT"], [74, 81, "INGREDIENT"], [83, 94, "INGREDIENT"], [119, 124, "INGREDIENT"], [140, 147, "PROCESS"], [186, 198, "INGREDIENT"], [344, 348, "PROCESS"], [408, 411, "INGREDIENT"], [530, 534, "INGREDIENT"], [593, 597, "INGREDIENT"], [601, 617, "INGREDIENT"], [652, 664, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
