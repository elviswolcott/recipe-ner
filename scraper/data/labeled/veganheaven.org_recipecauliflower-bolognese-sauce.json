["Ingredients:\n1  small head of cauliflower\n1  onion, chopped\n2  cloves of garlic, minced\n3 tablespoons tomato paste\n1 large can diced tomatoes (27 oz)\n2 teaspoons dried Italian herbs (I used thyme,basil, rosemary, and oregano)\n1 teaspoon dried oregano\n1/2  cup fresh basil, chopped\nsalt\npepper\n\nInstructions:\nBreak the cauliflower into medium-sized florets and put about 1/4 of the florets in a food processor. Pulse about 2-3 times until the cauliflower looks crumbly. If you don't have a pulse function, use the lowest setting. Add the remaining florets in several rounds. You don't want to add too much at once. Alternatively, you could also use a grater but this takes much longer.\nIn a large pan, heat some oil and saut\u00c3\u00a9 the onion for about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for another minute.\nStir in the cauliflower and the tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes. Then add the diced tomatoes and the herbs and cook for 6 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and serve with whole wheat spaghetti and chopped basil. If you want you can also add vegan Parmesan cheese.
