["Ingredients:\n200 grams wide rice noodles\n200 grams Chinese Broccoli (Gai Lan)\n3 tablespoons vegetable oil, for frying\n4 cloves garlic, finely minced\n2  Thai chiles, minced\n150 grams seitan \"chicken,\" sliced\n3 tablespoons vegan oyster sauce, I used Lee Kum Kee's\n2 teaspoons black bean sauce, I used Lee Kum Kee's\n2 tablespoons light soy sauce\n1 tablespoon dark soy sauce\n2 teaspoons brown sugar\n2 tablespoons water\n\nInstructions:\nPrepare Noodles. Prepare dried wide rice noodles according to packaged directions (usually this involves soaking or boiling). Note: taste the noodles to make sure they are just slightly underdone, as you will be frying them again in the wok/pan. If using fresh wide rice noodles, skip the soaking/boiling step. Once prepped, toss the noodles in about 1 tablespoon of oil. Set aside.\nPrepare the Sauce. Combine vegan oyster sauce, black bean sauce, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, brown sugar, and water.\nMake the Pad See Ew. Heat up a wok or a pan on high heat and swirl 2 tablespoons of oil around to even coat. Note: 2 tablespoons of oil seems like a lot, but ample oil is essential for the noodles to not stick together. Start by frying garlic and chiles until aromatic, about 30 seconds. Add Seitan \"Chicken\" and fry until lightly brown & charred, about 3-4 minutes. Add Chinese Broccoli (Gai Lan), followed by rice noodles and the prepared sauce. Note: drizzle the sauce down the sides of the wok for maximum flavor as it instantly boils. Gently toss and mix everything together by doing a scooping motion with your spatula. Continue to cook and allow everything to sit in the hot wok occasionally, so as to develop charred flavors. Once desired done-ness & flavor is reached, remove from the wok or pan.
