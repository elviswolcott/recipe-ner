Serve as part of meal with any lentil curry(Daal), or beans curry, or other soups/stews, Indian bread(Roti) and salad or any indian pickle.(my current favorite is the punjabi raw mango pickle)\nAnother way to make this, is with Boiled potatoes. Add the boiled potatoes to the pan at Step 4.\nMix well to coat. Add in the green onions as well along with the salt and turmeric and mix well. Cook on low heat for 6-8 minutes since the potatoes are already cooked. The green onions look fresher and retain their shape when cooked this way!
