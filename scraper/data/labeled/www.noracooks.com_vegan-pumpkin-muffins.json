["Ingredients:\n15  ounce can pumpkin puree\n1/3 cup melted vegan butter OR vegetable oil\n1/2 cup soy or almond milk, unsweetened\n1 1/4 cups brown sugar, lightly packed\n1 3/4 cups all purpose flour\n1  tablespoon baking powder\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n2 teaspoons ground cinnamon\n1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg\n1/2 teaspoon ground ginger\n1/4 teaspoon ground cloves\n1 cup non-dairy chocolate chips, raisins, cranberries or chopped walnuts\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees F and lightly grease a muffin pan. If you use paper liners, also make sure to spray the cups lightly with oil so the muffins don't get stuck to the paper.\nIn a large mixing bowl, add the pumpkin, melted vegan butter (or oil), non-dairy milk and brown sugar. Whisk until well combined and smooth.\nSift the flour, baking powder, salt and spices over the wet mixture (I use a fine mesh strainer for this or use a sifter).\nMix the dry ingredients into the wet gently using a large wooden spoon until just combined, being careful not to over mix.\nFold in any optional ingredients, if using, and fill the muffin cups full. Bake for 22-25 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean.
