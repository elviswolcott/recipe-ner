["Ingredients:\n3/4 cup all-purpose flour\n3/4 cup unsweetened almond milk\n3/4 cup panko bread crumbs\nsalt\nblack pepper\n1/2 head of cauliflower\n1 tablespoon sesame oil\n2 cloves of garlic, chopped\n1 teaspoon chopped ginger\n1 tablespoon tomato paste\n1/4 cup brown sugar\n1/4 cup rice vinegar\n1/4 cup soy sauce\n1/2 cup vegetable broth\n2 tablespoons corn starch\nsalt\nblack pepper\n2 tablespoons sesame seeds\n2  green onions\ncooked rice\n\nInstructions:\nHeat the oven to 350 F.\nIn a  bowl, combine the flour, the almond milk, and salt and pepper. Pour the panko bread crumbs on to a flate plate.\nCut the cauliflower into bite-sized florets. Dip the florets into the batter, so they're completely coated. Then roll them in the panko bread crumbs.\nLine a baking sheet with parchment paper and lay the cauliflower florets on the baking sheet. Don't put them on top of each other. Bake for 25 minutes.\nIn the meantime, make the general tso sauce. Add two tablespoons of water to the corn starch and stir well. Put aside. In a small sauce pan, heat the oil and saut\u00c3\u00a9 the garlic until it becomes lightly brown. Then add the ginger, the sugar, and the tomato paste. Cook for one minute. Then add the remaining ingredients (including the corn starch water mixture). Cook for 5 minutes. The sauce will thicken during this time.\nCoat the cauliflower florets with the sauce. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and green onions and enjoy immediately. I like serving the general tso's cauliflower with rice.", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 38, "INGREDIENT"], [39, 46, "QUANTITY"], [47, 70, "INGREDIENT"], [71, 78, "QUANTITY"], [79, 97, "INGREDIENT"], [98, 102, "INGREDIENT"], [103, 115, "INGREDIENT"], [128, 139, "INGREDIENT"], [140, 152, "QUANTITY"], [153, 163, "INGREDIENT"], [166, 172, "INGREDIENT"], [176, 182, "INGREDIENT"], [184, 191, "INGREDIENT"], [192, 202, "QUANTITY"], [203, 217, "INGREDIENT"], [218, 230, "QUANTITY"], [231, 243, "INGREDIENT"], [244, 251, "QUANTITY"], [252, 263, "INGREDIENT"], [264, 271, "QUANTITY"], [272, 284, "INGREDIENT"], [285, 292, "QUANTITY"], [293, 302, "INGREDIENT"], [303, 310, "QUANTITY"], [311, 326, "INGREDIENT"], [327, 340, "QUANTITY"], [341, 352, "INGREDIENT"], [353, 357, "INGREDIENT"], [358, 370, "INGREDIENT"], [371, 384, "QUANTITY"], [385, 397, "INGREDIENT"], [401, 413, "INGREDIENT"], [414, 425, "INGREDIENT"], [489, 494, "INGREDIENT"], [500, 512, "INGREDIENT"], [517, 521, "INGREDIENT"], [526, 532, "INGREDIENT"], [543, 561, "INGREDIENT"], [591, 602, "INGREDIENT"], [619, 626, "INGREDIENT"], [636, 643, "INGREDIENT"], [713, 731, "INGREDIENT"], [740, 746, "PROCESS"], [786, 805, "INGREDIENT"], [813, 819, "PROCESS"], [852, 856, "INGREDIENT"], [950, 958, "INGREDIENT"], [966, 977, "INGREDIENT"], [982, 986, "PROCESS"], [1035, 1038, "INGREDIENT"], [1054, 1060, "INGREDIENT"], [1098, 1101, "PROCESS"], [1106, 1112, "INGREDIENT"], [1118, 1123, "INGREDIENT"], [1133, 1145, "INGREDIENT"], [1173, 1176, "PROCESS"], [1218, 1229, "INGREDIENT"], [1230, 1235, "INGREDIENT"], [1316, 1335, "INGREDIENT"], [1366, 1378, "INGREDIENT"], [1383, 1395, "INGREDIENT"], [1452, 1463, "INGREDIENT"], [1469, 1473, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
