["Ingredients:\n1 recipe Chickpea Meatballs\n6-8  sandwich rolls (check ingredients to ensure vegan)\n1 jar your favorite pasta sauce (or make your own, about 3 cups)\n1  bag non-dairy mozzarella style cheese shreds* (OR use homemade vegan mozzarella)\n\nInstructions:\nMake the Chickpea Meatballs if you haven't already. I like to double the recipe and use 1 batch for spaghetti another night. Or make them ahead of time and freeze for easy weeknight meals.\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees F.\nAdd the chickpea meatballs to a large pot on the stove and cover them with the pasta sauce. Warm over low-medium heat, coating the meatballs with the sauce.\nFill a roll with meatballs (3-4, depending on the size of your balls). Top with a little more sauce from the pot. Place the rolls close together on a baking sheet and top with non-dairy cheese shreds or homemade mozzarella.\nBake for about 15-20 minutes, until the cheese is melted and hot. Remove from oven and serve.
