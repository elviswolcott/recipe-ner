["Ingredients:\n4 or 5   ears of corn/butta (preferably white)\n1  lime  (sliced into half and seeds removed)\n1 tsp or more cayenne/red chili powder\n1 1/2 tsp or more salt\n1/4 tsp cumin powder\n1/4 tsp or more chaat masala (recipe can be found in my cookbook, kala namak (Indian black salt), or amchoor (dry mango powder))\n\nInstructions:\nRemove the corn husk and strings from the corn.\nRoast the corn on the grill or open gas flame (gas stove) at medium high heat. Move it around every 30 seconds or so, so the corn gets roasted evenly. You will hear some kernels pop. All the kernels will blacken to varying degrees.\nMix all the spices in a bowl. Use a half lime to dip in the spice mix to pick up the spices and rub all over the corn, making sure to squeeze lime juice while doing so.\nServe hot!\nFor variation: Rub Mint cilantro chutney all over.", {"entities": [[30, 34, "INGREDIENT"], [91, 96, "INGREDIENT"], [106, 111, "QUANTITY"], [112, 144, "INGREDIENT"], [145, 154, "QUANTITY"], [155, 167, "INGREDIENT"], [168, 175, "QUANTITY"], [176, 188, "INGREDIENT"], [189, 196, "QUANTITY"], [197, 217, "INGREDIENT"], [226, 229, "INGREDIENT"], [255, 265, "INGREDIENT"], [267, 284, "INGREDIENT"], [290, 297, "INGREDIENT"], [299, 315, "INGREDIENT"], [344, 348, "INGREDIENT"], [375, 379, "INGREDIENT"], [391, 395, "INGREDIENT"], [403, 408, "PROCESS"], [492, 497, "INGREDIENT"], [506, 510, "INGREDIENT"], [516, 523, "PROCESS"], [673, 678, "INGREDIENT"], [679, 682, "PROCESS"], [726, 730, "INGREDIENT"], [755, 765, "INGREDIENT"], [812, 816, "INGREDIENT"], [817, 825, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
