["Ingredients:\n1 pound asparagus\nolive oil spray (or 2 teaspoons olive oil)\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n1/8 teaspoon black pepper\n\nInstructions:\nTrim the chewy ends off the asparagus, about an inch or two from the bottom, either cutting them with a sharp knife or snapping with your hands.\nSpray the bottom of the air fryer with olive oil.\nPlace the asparagus in the air fryer, in a single layer as much as possible (it&#039;s okay if some overlap a little though), and spray lightly with olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.\nAir fry at 400 degrees F for 7-10 minutes, until crisp but not blackened and burned. Thin pieces will take only 7 minutes or so, while thicker pieces could take 10 or even 11 minutes, depending on their size. Check them often after 7 minutes to make sure the asparagus does not burn.\nServe immediately, sprinkling with some vegan parmesan, if desired. Store leftover asparagus in the refrigerator for 2-3 days, and reheat in the air fryer for about 2 minutes to re-crisp.", {"entities": [[31, 40, "INGREDIENT"], [51, 62, "QUANTITY"], [63, 72, "INGREDIENT"], [74, 86, "QUANTITY"], [87, 91, "INGREDIENT"], [92, 104, "QUANTITY"], [105, 117, "INGREDIENT"], [317, 326, "INGREDIENT"], [477, 486, "INGREDIENT"], [502, 506, "INGREDIENT"], [511, 517, "INGREDIENT"], [523, 526, "PROCESS"], [641, 646, "INGREDIENT"], [843, 857, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
