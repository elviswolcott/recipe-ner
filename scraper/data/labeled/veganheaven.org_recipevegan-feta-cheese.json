["Ingredients:\n8 oz firm or extra-firm tofu\n1/2 cup apple cider vinegar\n2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice\n1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk\n1 teaspoon dried thyme\n1 teaspoon dried oregano\n3  cloves of garlic, minced\n1 teaspoon salt\n\nInstructions:\nStart by pressing your tofu to remove the excess water, so it will hold its shape better. Remove the tofu from the packaging. Place it in a tofu press and let it press for about 30 minutes. Alternatively you could also press your tofu without a tofu press. Wrap it with a clean dishtowel.\u00c2\u00a0Place it on a plate, cover it with a baking sheet, and then place something heavy on top. I usually use a stack of cookbooks. Leave it like this for 30 minutes. You could also skip this step if you want.\u00c2\u00a0\nCut the tofu into cubes.\u00c2\u00a0\nMake the marinade. Place all ingredients in a bowl or a container with a lid and stir until well combined.\u00c2\u00a0\nAdd the tofu cubes and carefully stir, so all tofu cubes are covered with the marinade.\u00c2\u00a0\nCover with the lid and leave in the fridge overnight to marinate.\u00c2\u00a0\nDrain and get rid of the excess marinade. Use the tofu for salads or pasta recipes.\u00c2\u00a0", {"entities": [[13, 17, "QUANTITY"], [18, 41, "INGREDIENT"], [42, 49, "QUANTITY"], [50, 69, "INGREDIENT"], [70, 83, "QUANTITY"], [84, 101, "INGREDIENT"], [102, 109, "QUANTITY"], [110, 133, "INGREDIENT"], [134, 144, "QUANTITY"], [145, 156, "INGREDIENT"], [157, 167, "QUANTITY"], [168, 181, "INGREDIENT"], [185, 191, "INGREDIENT"], [195, 201, "INGREDIENT"], [203, 209, "INGREDIENT"], [210, 220, "QUANTITY"], [221, 225, "INGREDIENT"], [250, 258, "PROCESS"], [264, 268, "INGREDIENT"], [290, 295, "INGREDIENT"], [342, 346, "INGREDIENT"], [381, 385, "INGREDIENT"], [386, 391, "PROCESS"], [403, 408, "PROCESS"], [460, 465, "PROCESS"], [471, 475, "INGREDIENT"], [486, 490, "INGREDIENT"], [491, 496, "PROCESS"], [568, 574, "PROCESS"], [591, 596, "PROCESS"], [745, 749, "INGREDIENT"], [845, 849, "PROCESS"], [881, 885, "INGREDIENT"], [906, 910, "PROCESS"], [919, 923, "INGREDIENT"], [1081, 1085, "INGREDIENT"], [1100, 1105, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
