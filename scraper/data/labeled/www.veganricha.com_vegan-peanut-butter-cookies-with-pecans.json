If the dough is too sticky, add a tbsp flour at a time and mix in. * If the dough is too crumbly, add a splash of non dairy milk or aquafaba and mix and continue to do it till it is one soft mass. Fold in the chopped pecans and chocolate chips\nChill the dough for 10 to 15 minutes. *You can chill the dough for upto 2 days to make ahead.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F/180c.\nTake 1.5 to 2 tbsp of the dough to make a ball. Place on parchment lined baking sheet.\nPress each of the balls with a fork to flatten slightly and make a criss cross pattern.\nBake for 10 to 11 minutes (a minute longer for large cookies). The tops will be soft but will set as the cookies cool. If the tops and edges both are too soft, bake an extra minute.\nCool the cookies on the sheet for 15 minutes, then on wire rack until completely cooled.
