["Ingredients:\n2 cups all purpose flour\n1/2 cup granulated sugar\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n3/4 cup vegan butter, cold\n1 1/2 cups brown sugar\n2/3 cup brown rice syrup\n3 tablespoons non-dairy milk\n3 tablespoons melted vegan butter\n3 tablespoons cornstarch\n1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n2 cups coarsely chopped pecans\noptional: coarse salt, for sprinkling on top\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a 9 x 13 inch pan with parchment paper.\nPrepare the crust: In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar and salt. Cut in the vegan butter with a pastry cutter, or two knives. The mixture will look like fine crumbs. Place in the prepared pan and press down evenly with your hands to form the crust. Bake for 10 minutes, then remove from oven and set aside while you make the topping.\nMake the topping: In the same large bowl you made the crust in, stir together the brown sugar, brown rice syrup, non-dairy milk, melted vegan butter, cornstarch and vanilla until well combined and smooth. Fold in the pecans, then pour over the crust. Use a spatula to spread it out as evenly as possible.\nBake in the oven for 25-30 minutes, until the pecan topping is bubbling. Remove from the oven, and let cool at room temperature for 30 minutes, then place in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours to set.\nCarefully lift the parchment paper with the bars out of the pan and slice into bars with a large sharp knife. I like to cut off the edges as well because they get very hard. Store leftover bars in the refrigerator for 5-6 days.", {"entities": [[13, 19, "QUANTITY"], [20, 37, "INGREDIENT"], [38, 45, "QUANTITY"], [46, 62, "INGREDIENT"], [63, 75, "QUANTITY"], [76, 80, "INGREDIENT"], [81, 88, "QUANTITY"], [89, 107, "INGREDIENT"], [108, 118, "QUANTITY"], [119, 130, "INGREDIENT"], [131, 138, "QUANTITY"], [139, 155, "INGREDIENT"], [156, 169, "QUANTITY"], [170, 184, "INGREDIENT"], [185, 198, "QUANTITY"], [199, 218, "INGREDIENT"], [219, 232, "QUANTITY"], [233, 243, "INGREDIENT"], [244, 254, "QUANTITY"], [255, 275, "INGREDIENT"], [276, 282, "QUANTITY"], [283, 306, "INGREDIENT"], [317, 328, "INGREDIENT"], [498, 503, "INGREDIENT"], [505, 510, "INGREDIENT"], [515, 520, "INGREDIENT"], [532, 544, "INGREDIENT"], [652, 657, "PROCESS"], [854, 858, "PROCESS"], [872, 883, "INGREDIENT"], [885, 901, "INGREDIENT"], [903, 917, "INGREDIENT"], [919, 938, "INGREDIENT"], [940, 950, "INGREDIENT"], [955, 962, "INGREDIENT"], [1007, 1014, "INGREDIENT"], [1244, 1249, "PROCESS"]]}]
