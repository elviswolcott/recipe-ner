["Ingredients:\n1 scant cup mashed banana (Use scant cup, 2 large or 3 medium (if your bread tends to bake gummy use 3/4 cup))\n1/3 cup sugar (such as light brown sugar or coconut sugar)\n1/4 cup maple syrup\n1 tsp vanilla extract  (or 1/2 tsp cinnamon or both)\n2 tbsp oil (omit to make oil-free, add a tbsp of shredded coconut for additional moisture)\n1/3 cup almond milk (or use other non dairy milk such as light coconut or soy )\n1 tsp vinegar\n1\u00c2\u00a0 3/4 cups all-purpose flour (I usually use 1 1/2 all-purpose and 1/4 cup of whole wheat or spelt or all 1 3/4 cup all purpose)\n1/4 cup almond flour (, or use more flour for Nutfree )\n1.5 tsp baking powder\n1/4 tsp baking soda\n1/2 tsp salt\n3 tbsp cocoa powder\n1/3 cup  boiling water\n1/4  cups  vegan chocolate chips\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 365F (185 C) and line 9x5 inch pan with parchment.\nIn a bowl mix all the wet ingredients until well combined\nIn another bowl mix the flours, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix well.\nAdd 1 3/4 cup of the dry mixture to the wet ingredient bowl and mix it in. Add the rest of the dry flour mix 1 tbsp at a time, until batter is stiff like a muffin batter.\nDivide the batter into two bowls.\nFor the chocolate layer, mix the cocoa in a small bowl with 3 tbsp of boiling water, mix this into the first bowl.\nIn the second bowl, add 1-2 tbsp of boiling water and mix in so that mixture is not that thick.\nNow you can assemble the loaf as you like with whatever pattern. I usually alternate the batters and spread them out for a marble effect. Once all of the batter is finished, top with the mini chocolate chips.\nBake for 55-60 minutes. Check with a toothpick from the center of the loaf\nCool the loaf for 10 minutes before taking it out of the pan, cool completely before slicing.", {"entities": [[21, 24, "QUANTITY"], [25, 38, "INGREDIENT"], [50, 53, "QUANTITY"], [99, 103, "PROCESS"], [114, 121, "QUANTITY"], [124, 131, "QUANTITY"], [132, 137, "INGREDIENT"], [153, 181, "INGREDIENT"], [183, 190, "QUANTITY"], [191, 202, "INGREDIENT"], [203, 208, "QUANTITY"], [209, 224, "INGREDIENT"], [230, 237, "QUANTITY"], [238, 246, "INGREDIENT"], [256, 262, "QUANTITY"], [263, 266, "INGREDIENT"], [281, 284, "INGREDIENT"], [291, 294, "PROCESS"], [305, 321, "INGREDIENT"], [351, 366, "INGREDIENT"], [381, 403, "INGREDIENT"], [410, 417, "INGREDIENT"], [427, 432, "QUANTITY"], [433, 440, "INGREDIENT"], [445, 453, "QUANTITY"], [454, 471, "INGREDIENT"], [509, 516, "QUANTITY"], [520, 531, "INGREDIENT"], [535, 540, "INGREDIENT"], [548, 557, "QUANTITY"], [571, 578, "QUANTITY"], [579, 591, "INGREDIENT"], [607, 612, "INGREDIENT"], [635, 648, "INGREDIENT"], [649, 656, "QUANTITY"], [657, 668, "INGREDIENT"], [669, 676, "QUANTITY"], [677, 681, "INGREDIENT"], [682, 688, "QUANTITY"], [689, 701, "INGREDIENT"], [702, 709, "QUANTITY"], [711, 724, "INGREDIENT"], [725, 734, "QUANTITY"], [736, 757, "INGREDIENT"], [854, 857, "PROCESS"], [918, 921, "PROCESS"], [934, 947, "INGREDIENT"], [949, 960, "INGREDIENT"], [966, 971, "INGREDIENT"], [986, 995, "QUANTITY"], [1046, 1049, "PROCESS"], [1081, 1086, "INGREDIENT"], [1087, 1090, "PROCESS"], [1091, 1097, "QUANTITY"], [1195, 1204, "INGREDIENT"], [1212, 1215, "PROCESS"], [1220, 1225, "INGREDIENT"], [1247, 1253, "QUANTITY"], [1257, 1270, "INGREDIENT"], [1272, 1275, "PROCESS"], [1322, 1325, "PROCESS"], [1328, 1334, "QUANTITY"], [1338, 1351, "INGREDIENT"], [1356, 1359, "PROCESS"], [1406, 1409, "INGREDIENT"], [1585, 1605, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
