["Ingredients:\n3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour\n1 teaspoon salt\n1 teaspoon instant yeast\n1 pinch sugar\n3 tablespoons olive oil\n1 cup lukewarm water\n1 cup hummus\n8-10  mushrooms, sliced\n1 handful fresh spinach\n1/2 cup black olives\n1/2 cup artichoke hearts in oil, roughly chopped\n1/2 cup cherry tomatoes, cut into halves\n1/2  red onion, cut into rings\n2 teaspoons dried oregano\nred pepper flakes, to taste (optional)\n\nInstructions:\nFirst make the dough: In a medium-sized bowl, combine all dry ingredients. Then add the oil and the lukewarm water. Knead with your hands until you got a smooth dough. Form into a ball and cover the bowl with a damp cloth or plastic wrap. Place into a warm room and let it rise for about an hour until it has doubled in size.\nMove the dough to a flour-dusted surface, divide the dough into two balls, and form it into two pizzas using your hands. Alternatively, you could also make one larger pizza.\nEvenly spread the pizzas with the hummus and add the pizza toppings on top. Sprinkle with oregano and red pepper flakes. Bake for about 20 minutes at 350 F. The baking time can vary depending on the oven you use.", {"entities": [[13, 23, "QUANTITY"], [24, 41, "INGREDIENT"], [42, 52, "QUANTITY"], [53, 57, "INGREDIENT"], [58, 68, "QUANTITY"], [69, 82, "INGREDIENT"], [91, 96, "INGREDIENT"], [97, 110, "QUANTITY"], [111, 120, "INGREDIENT"], [121, 126, "QUANTITY"], [127, 141, "INGREDIENT"], [142, 147, "QUANTITY"], [148, 154, "INGREDIENT"], [161, 178, "INGREDIENT"], [189, 202, "INGREDIENT"], [203, 210, "QUANTITY"], [211, 223, "INGREDIENT"], [224, 231, "QUANTITY"], [232, 272, "INGREDIENT"], [273, 280, "QUANTITY"], [281, 313, "INGREDIENT"], [319, 328, "INGREDIENT"], [345, 356, "QUANTITY"], [357, 370, "INGREDIENT"], [371, 388, "INGREDIENT"], [505, 508, "PROCESS"], [513, 516, "INGREDIENT"], [525, 539, "INGREDIENT"], [658, 662, "PROCESS"], [771, 776, "INGREDIENT"], [959, 965, "INGREDIENT"], [970, 973, "PROCESS"], [1015, 1022, "INGREDIENT"], [1027, 1044, "INGREDIENT"], [1086, 1092, "PROCESS"], [1098, 1101, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
