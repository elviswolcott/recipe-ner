["Ingredients:\n1 Small head Cauliflower (chopped into small florets)\n1/2 cup  rice flour\n3 tbsp tapioca starch (or use cornstarch )\n1/2 tsp  garlic powder\n1/4 tsp salt\n2 tsp soy sauce\n2 tsp oil\n1/2 cup water\n1 tsp oil\n1/2 cup Chopped red bell pepper\n1/2 cup Chopped green bell pepper\n3 cloves of garlic minced\n2 tsp minced ginger\n1/3 cup soy sauce\n3-4 tbsp brown sugar\n3 tbsp rice vinegar\n1 tbsp mirin\n2 tsp sesame  oil\n1 tbsp or more sambal oelek (or other Asian chili sauce)\n1/4 tsp salt\n1/2 cup water\n1 tbsp cornstarch\n\nInstructions:\nChop your cauliflower florets into equal sizes, and set them aside.\nIn a bowl, mix the rest of the ingredients for the batter, until well combined, then mix in the cauliflower florets into the bowl, and toss well to coat. The batter is going to be a thick batter. It will continue to thicken as it sits. So if it&#039;s thinner when you mix it, let it sit for a few minutes before adding the florets. You can also add in 1-2 tsp more rice flour as needed to thicken it. Toss the florets until all the batter coats them evenly. There is just enough batter to coat all of the florets.\nTransfer the coated florets to a parchment-lined baking sheet, and bake at 400 degrees F (205 c)for 30-35 minutes.", {"entities": [[39, 46, "INGREDIENT"], [58, 65, "INGREDIENT"], [67, 74, "QUANTITY"], [76, 86, "INGREDIENT"], [87, 93, "QUANTITY"], [94, 108, "INGREDIENT"], [117, 127, "INGREDIENT"], [130, 137, "QUANTITY"], [139, 152, "INGREDIENT"], [153, 160, "QUANTITY"], [161, 165, "INGREDIENT"], [166, 171, "QUANTITY"], [172, 181, "INGREDIENT"], [182, 187, "QUANTITY"], [188, 191, "INGREDIENT"], [192, 199, "QUANTITY"], [200, 205, "INGREDIENT"], [206, 211, "QUANTITY"], [212, 215, "INGREDIENT"], [216, 223, "QUANTITY"], [224, 247, "INGREDIENT"], [248, 255, "QUANTITY"], [256, 281, "INGREDIENT"], [284, 290, "INGREDIENT"], [294, 300, "INGREDIENT"], [301, 307, "INGREDIENT"], [308, 313, "QUANTITY"], [314, 327, "INGREDIENT"], [328, 335, "QUANTITY"], [336, 345, "INGREDIENT"], [348, 354, "QUANTITY"], [355, 366, "INGREDIENT"], [367, 373, "QUANTITY"], [374, 386, "INGREDIENT"], [387, 393, "QUANTITY"], [394, 399, "INGREDIENT"], [400, 405, "QUANTITY"], [406, 417, "INGREDIENT"], [418, 424, "QUANTITY"], [425, 445, "INGREDIENT"], [475, 482, "QUANTITY"], [483, 487, "INGREDIENT"], [488, 495, "QUANTITY"], [496, 501, "INGREDIENT"], [502, 508, "QUANTITY"], [509, 519, "INGREDIENT"], [545, 564, "INGREDIENT"], [614, 617, "PROCESS"], [688, 691, "PROCESS"], [699, 718, "INGREDIENT"], [872, 875, "PROCESS"], [916, 922, "PROCESS"], [927, 934, "INGREDIENT"], [940, 943, "INGREDIENT"], [949, 952, "PROCESS"], [958, 963, "QUANTITY"], [969, 979, "INGREDIENT"], [1014, 1021, "INGREDIENT"], [1109, 1116, "INGREDIENT"], [1138, 1145, "INGREDIENT"], [1167, 1173, "PROCESS"], [1185, 1189, "PROCESS"]]}]
