Add baking powder, salt, sugar and mix well.\nAdd the oil and 1 cup + 2 tbsp non dairy milk and whisk well. Depending on the flours and non dairy milk used, you will need 1-2 tbsp more milk for a smooth batter. (You can add in chocolate chips or small blueberries in the batter at this time for variation)\nLet the batter sit for atleast 15 mins. (You can adjust the batter at this time if too thick, with additional non dairy milk, or a tbsp of flour if too thin)\nHeat your waffle maker. When hot, brush or spray oil if needed. Add the batter depending on the size of your waffle iron. (*Add a smaller portion of the batter, sprinkle some cinnamon sugar mix and add another tbsp or so batter on top for cinnamon swirl waffles)\nCook until golden. The waffles will crisp more on cooling for a min or so. Remove the waffle and serve immediately or store in a warm oven (225 deg F) until ready to use.
