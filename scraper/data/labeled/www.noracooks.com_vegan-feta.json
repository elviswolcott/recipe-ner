["Ingredients:\n1 1/2 cups raw cashews\n3/4 cup water\n1/4 cup brine from a jar of green olives\n1/4 cup fresh lemon juice\n2 teaspoons white vinegar\n1 1/2 teaspoons salt (or 2 teaspoons for more saltiness!)\n1/2 teaspoon onion powder\n1/2 teaspoon garlic powder\n2 teaspoons agar agar powder\n\nInstructions:\nBring 3 cups of water to a boil. Pour the hot water over the cashews and let soak for 5 minutes.\nDrain the cashews, discard the soaking water and add the cashews, 3/4 cup fresh water and all other ingredients to a high powered blender EXCEPT the agar agar powder. Blend until smooth.\nAdd agar agar powder to the blender and blend to incorporate.\nTransfer to a small pot and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until it begins to simmer. Cook for about 2 minutes until it thickens, then remove from heat and place in a mold (I used a round glass bowl).\nChill at room temperature for 10-15 minutes, then transfer to the refrigerator, uncovered for at least 3 hours until firm.\nThat&#39;s it! The cheese is semi-soft and spreadable, but you can also slice or crumble it. Enjoy!", {"entities": [[13, 23, "QUANTITY"], [24, 35, "INGREDIENT"], [36, 43, "QUANTITY"], [44, 49, "INGREDIENT"], [50, 57, "QUANTITY"], [58, 90, "INGREDIENT"], [91, 98, "QUANTITY"], [99, 116, "INGREDIENT"], [117, 128, "QUANTITY"], [129, 142, "INGREDIENT"], [143, 158, "QUANTITY"], [159, 163, "INGREDIENT"], [168, 179, "QUANTITY"], [201, 213, "QUANTITY"], [214, 226, "INGREDIENT"], [227, 239, "QUANTITY"], [240, 253, "INGREDIENT"], [254, 265, "QUANTITY"], [266, 282, "INGREDIENT"], [304, 310, "QUANTITY"], [311, 319, "INGREDIENT"], [325, 329, "PROCESS"], [340, 349, "INGREDIENT"], [359, 366, "INGREDIENT"], [405, 412, "INGREDIENT"], [434, 439, "INGREDIENT"], [444, 447, "PROCESS"], [452, 459, "INGREDIENT"], [461, 468, "QUANTITY"], [469, 474, "INGREDIENT"], [475, 480, "INGREDIENT"], [544, 560, "INGREDIENT"], [586, 602, "INGREDIENT"], [672, 676, "PROCESS"], [695, 703, "PROCESS"], [812, 817, "PROCESS"], [1043, 1046, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
