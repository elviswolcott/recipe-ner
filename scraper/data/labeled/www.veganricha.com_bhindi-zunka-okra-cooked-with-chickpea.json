["Ingredients:\n3 Tablespoons chickpea flour ((besan))\n2 cups chopped okra\n1/2 teaspoon cumin powder\n1/2 teaspoon coriander powder\n1/4 teaspoon fennel seeds\n1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder\npinch of asofetida ((hing) - optional, it helps add a garlicky flavor and helps with digestion)\n2/3 teaspoon salt or to taste\n1/2 teaspoon chili flakes or red chili powder to taste\n2 teaspoons oil\n\nInstructions:\nIn a pan, dry roast the chickpea flour on low-medium heat stirring every 15-30 seconds till it gives out an aroma or starts to change to a deeper color(5-7 minutes).\nKeep the chickpea flour aside. Add oil to the pan and heat on medium heat.\nAdd in the asofetida, cumin and coriander powders and fennel seeds and mix well for a few seconds.\nAdd in the turmeric and chili flakes and mix well.\nAdd in the okra and mix well to coat. Cook partially covered on low-medium heat for 10 minutes.\nAdd half the salt and mix well and cook for another 3 to 5 minutes till okra is tender crisp done. If the okra is too slimy, cook uncovered for a bit longer.\nAdd in the roasted chickpea flour, a Tablespoon at a time, and a little more salt and mix well to coat okra. Sprinkle a few drops of water to help the chickpea flour stick to the okra(you might not need water if the okra is still gooey).\nCook on medium heat for 2-3 minutes, stirring every 15 seconds till the chickpea flour is clumpy and sticking to okra pieces and not dry. Adjust salt and spice if needed, mix and take off heat. You can add more chickpea flour to make a really crusty okra which makes for a fun snack.\nServe hot topped with chopped cilantro leaves or crushed roasted peanuts, with Roti/Naan or any Indian flat bread, and daal(lentil soup). or eat as is, as a snack!", {"entities": [[13, 26, "QUANTITY"], [27, 41, "INGREDIENT"], [44, 49, "INGREDIENT"], [52, 58, "QUANTITY"], [59, 71, "INGREDIENT"], [72, 84, "QUANTITY"], [85, 97, "INGREDIENT"], [98, 110, "QUANTITY"], [111, 127, "INGREDIENT"], [128, 140, "QUANTITY"], [141, 153, "INGREDIENT"], [154, 166, "QUANTITY"], [167, 182, "INGREDIENT"], [192, 201, "INGREDIENT"], [204, 208, "INGREDIENT"], [231, 234, "PROCESS"], [279, 291, "QUANTITY"], [292, 308, "INGREDIENT"], [309, 321, "QUANTITY"], [322, 363, "INGREDIENT"], [364, 375, "QUANTITY"], [376, 379, "INGREDIENT"], [409, 414, "PROCESS"], [419, 433, "INGREDIENT"], [453, 461, "PROCESS"], [570, 584, "INGREDIENT"], [596, 599, "INGREDIENT"], [647, 656, "INGREDIENT"], [658, 663, "INGREDIENT"], [668, 677, "INGREDIENT"], [690, 702, "INGREDIENT"], [707, 710, "PROCESS"], [746, 754, "INGREDIENT"], [759, 771, "INGREDIENT"], [776, 779, "PROCESS"], [806, 809, "PROCESS"], [895, 899, "INGREDIENT"], [904, 907, "PROCESS"], [917, 921, "PROCESS"], [1007, 1011, "PROCESS"], [1051, 1058, "PROCESS"], [1059, 1073, "INGREDIENT"], [1117, 1121, "INGREDIENT"], [1126, 1129, "PROCESS"], [1170, 1178, "INGREDIENT"], [1191, 1205, "INGREDIENT"], [1243, 1248, "INGREDIENT"], [1315, 1323, "PROCESS"], [1350, 1364, "INGREDIENT"], [1423, 1427, "INGREDIENT"], [1432, 1437, "INGREDIENT"], [1449, 1452, "PROCESS"], [1476, 1479, "INGREDIENT"], [1480, 1483, "PROCESS"], [1489, 1503, "INGREDIENT"], [1584, 1607, "INGREDIENT"], [1619, 1634, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
