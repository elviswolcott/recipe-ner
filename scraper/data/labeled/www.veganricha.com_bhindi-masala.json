Lots of onion garlic chili used in Indian food, so i know i will need more chopped for dals or curries.\nAdd okra and pinch of salt., Cook for 10 minutes or until golden on some edges. Stir occasionally. Roasting the okra till the edges dry out a bit will seal in the slime.\nAdd spices, tomato, ketchup, salt and water.
