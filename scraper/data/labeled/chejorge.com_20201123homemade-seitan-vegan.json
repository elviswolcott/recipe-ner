["Ingredients:\n1 can (400 g) chickpeas, including liquid\n250 grams vital wheat gluten\n3 tablespoons light brown miso\n1 teaspoon distilled vinegar\n1 tablespoon maple syrup\n200 grams oat milk (or other plant-based milk)\n1 teaspoon mushroom bouillon powder\n2 teaspoons garlic powder\n2 teaspoons onion powder\n1 teaspoon paprika/cayenne pepper\n1/2 teaspoon fine salt\n\nInstructions:\nPrepare Wet Mix. In a food processor, combine the can of chickpeas, light brown miso, distilled vinegar, maple syrup, oat milk, mushroom bouillon powder, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika/cayenne pepper, and fine salt. Blend well until completely smooth. Note: you can pass the wet mix through a mesh sieve if little bits still remain.\nPrepare Seitan Dough. In a large mixing bowl, slowly add your wet mix to vital wheat gluten while stirring. Mix well until a rough dough forms. Turn the dough onto a clean counter and knead for about 8-10 minutes by hand, smearing it on the counter to encourage gluten development. Note: Be sure to knead the dough very hard, or else you'll end up with gummy seitan! Place the dough back into a clean food processor and pulse for 2-3 more minutes. You should be able to see the gluten strands become stringy & fibrous-looking. Note: the more you pulse the Seitan dough, the more stringy & fibrous it becomes. Be careful not to burn the motor of your food processor, however.\nSteam The Seitan. Split the dough in two & gather each piece of dough into an oval slab. Wrap each piece with two layers of parchment paper & use butcher's twine to tie it all up. Wrap very tightly to prevent the Seitan from expanding too much. Then, using your preferred steaming method, steam the Seitan dough for 2-2.5 hours, or until completely cooked through. Let cool for about 30 minutes before using or transferring to store in the refrigerator.
