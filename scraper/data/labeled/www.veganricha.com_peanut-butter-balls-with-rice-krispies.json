["Ingredients:\n3/4 cup peanut butter (at room temp (I like smooth unsweetened nut butter))\n1/3 cup coconut sugar\n1 tsp vanilla extract\n1 tbsp maple syrup\n1/8 tsp salt\n4 tbsp chopped dark chocolate or a mix of dark chocolate and mini chocolate chips\n1.5 cup rice krispies or chocolate rice krispies\n2 tsp oil or maple syrup to help bind (optional, as needed)\n\nInstructions:\nAdd peanut butter, coconut sugar, vanilla, maple syrup to the food processor, process for a minute to mix the sugar.\nAdd chocolate, salt, 1 cup krispies and pulse to mix and break most of them. Add the remaining rice krispies and pulse to mix and break half of the krispies.\nShape using hands or a scoop. Hands will warm the nut butter making it easier to bind. If using a scoop you might need to add\u00c2\u00a0maple or oil so that the mixture sticks easily as some nut butters are dryer.\nShape, chill for a few mins and serve. Store refrigerated for upto 2 weeks, freeze for upto a month.", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 34, "INGREDIENT"], [76, 86, "INGREDIENT"], [89, 96, "QUANTITY"], [97, 110, "INGREDIENT"], [111, 116, "QUANTITY"], [117, 132, "INGREDIENT"], [133, 139, "QUANTITY"], [140, 151, "INGREDIENT"], [152, 159, "QUANTITY"], [160, 164, "INGREDIENT"], [165, 171, "QUANTITY"], [172, 246, "INGREDIENT"], [251, 254, "QUANTITY"], [255, 295, "INGREDIENT"], [296, 301, "QUANTITY"], [302, 333, "INGREDIENT"], [375, 388, "INGREDIENT"], [390, 403, "INGREDIENT"], [405, 412, "INGREDIENT"], [414, 425, "INGREDIENT"], [473, 476, "PROCESS"], [481, 486, "INGREDIENT"], [492, 501, "INGREDIENT"], [503, 507, "INGREDIENT"], [509, 514, "QUANTITY"], [537, 540, "PROCESS"], [583, 587, "INGREDIENT"], [610, 613, "PROCESS"], [696, 706, "INGREDIENT"], [773, 778, "INGREDIENT"], [782, 785, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
