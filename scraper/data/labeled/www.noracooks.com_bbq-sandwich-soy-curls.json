["Ingredients:\n(1) 8-ounce Bag Soy Curls\n1 recipe  Quick and Easy Vegan Barbecue Sauce  (OR 18-20 ounces your favorite bbq sauce)\n4-6  buns or rolls (1 for each person)\nOptional: 1 recipe  Classic Vegan Coleslaw\n\nInstructions:\nAdd the entire bag of soy curls to a large bowl, and cover with warm water. Let soak for 10 minutes to re-hydrate, and then drain the excess water.&nbsp;\nWhile the soy curls are soaking, make the Quick and Easy Vegan Barbecue Sauce, if using.\nOnce drained, put them back in the large bowl and pull them apart with your hands to create a more \"pulled meat\", if desired. This step is not completely necessary, but I like them a bit smaller and pulled.\nNow, place the soy curls in a large frying pan. Add 3/4 of the barbecue sauce and cook over low-medium heat, stirring frequently.&nbsp;\nRemove from heat, and serve on buns or rolls with Classic Vegan Coleslaw, if desired.", {"entities": [[93, 102, "QUANTITY"], [103, 126, "INGREDIENT"], [154, 158, "INGREDIENT"], [201, 209, "INGREDIENT"], [247, 256, "INGREDIENT"], [289, 299, "INGREDIENT"], [389, 398, "INGREDIENT"], [680, 685, "PROCESS"], [690, 699, "INGREDIENT"], [711, 717, "PROCESS"], [738, 752, "INGREDIENT"], [757, 761, "PROCESS"], [784, 792, "PROCESS"], [875, 883, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
