Add the cream cheese ingredients  in a small food processor and process until smooth. Transfer to a bowl. Taste and adjust flavor (salt, tang, add a pinch of sugar to balance if needed)\nAdd the peppers, onion and sun dried tomato and mix. Chill for 15 mins.\nSpread the mixture on 2 large tortillas, spread evenly, not more than 1/4 inch thick.\nAdd baby spinach or fresh herbs on top. Roll the tortillas tightly, use a little cream cheese to seal the ends. Chill for atleast 2 hours so that the cream cheese can get stiff and the rolls ups can be sliced easily. Slice with a sharp serrated knife. Serve cold.\nThese pinwheels can also be served pan-fried. Lightly dust flour on both sides and pan fry until golden and serve.
