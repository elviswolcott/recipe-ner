["Ingredients:\n2/3 cup melted refined coconut oil\n3/4 cup brown sugar\n1/4 cup soy milk\n1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n1 1/2 cups all purpose flour\n1 tablespoon cornstarch\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n3/4 cup non-dairy chocolate chips\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line two medium-sized baking sheets with parchment paper. Or lightly grease the pans instead.\nMelt the coconut oil in a microwave safe measuring glass (or bowl) for 1-2 minutes until completely liquid and warm. Measure to make sure you have exactly 2/3 cup melted coconut oil.\nAdd the warm coconut oil to a large mixing bowl along with the brown sugar and whisk well to combine. Now add the soy milk and vanilla and whisk well until smooth. It should resemble caramel at this point.\nTo the bowl with the liquid ingredients, add the flour, cornstarch, baking soda and salt. Mix with a large spoon until just combined. Fold in the chocolate chips.\nRoll into balls about 1 1/2 tablespoons each. Place on the pan, leaving a little room for the cookies to spread. Bake for 9-11 minutes. They will look underdone and too soft, but will firm up a lot as they cook and become chewy.\nLet them cool for 10 minutes on the pan, then transfer to a cooling rack.
