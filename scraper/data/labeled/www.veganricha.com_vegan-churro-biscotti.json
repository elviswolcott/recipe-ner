["Ingredients:\n1 1/2 cups flour (I use all-purpose)\n1 tbsp cornstarch\n2 tbsp almond flour (, Omit to make  nut free)\n1.5 tsp baking powder\n1/4 tsp salt\n1/2 tsp cinnamon\n1/2 cup non dairy milk\n1 tbsp oil\n2 tbsp maple syrup\n3 tbsp sugar\n1 1/2 tbsp sugar (I use a mixture of coconut sugar and brown sugar)\n1 tsp cinnamon\n\nInstructions:\nIn a bowl, mix the flour, cornstarch, almond flour, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon, and set aside.\nIn another bowl, mix the non dairy milk, oil, maple syrup, and sugar. Mix well until the sugar is dissolved.\nCombine the wet with the dry, and mix to make a sticky, stiff doughy mixture. Transfer this to a parchment-lined baking sheet.\nWet your hands and using more water, shape the mixture into an oval, and press it down to even it out so that it is about 1/2-3/4 inches thick. Keep pressing, use a couple more drops of water for whenever it gets sticky again, and keep pressing and spread it out.\nIn a small bowl, mix the sugar and cinnamon for topping until well combined, and then sprinkle this all over the dough(which should still be a bit wet on the top). Press it down lightly with your hands if needed.\nBake at 350 degrees F(180 C) for 22-25 minutes. Check with a toothpick in the center.\nRemove the baking sheet, and let it cool completely, then using a very sharp or serrated knife, slice the oval into 1/2 inch thick slices. Spread these slices over the parchment-lined baking sheet again, flattened on the wider side of the biscotti.\nBake at 275 degrees F (135 C) for 1 hour, or until the biscotti is crisp to your preference.\nCool completely and then store in an airtight container and keep on the counter for up to three weeks. You can also ice these with a simple icing of sugar and non-dairy milk.", {"entities": [[13, 23, "QUANTITY"], [24, 29, "INGREDIENT"], [50, 56, "QUANTITY"], [57, 67, "INGREDIENT"], [68, 74, "QUANTITY"], [75, 87, "INGREDIENT"], [123, 136, "INGREDIENT"], [137, 144, "QUANTITY"], [145, 149, "INGREDIENT"], [150, 157, "QUANTITY"], [158, 166, "INGREDIENT"], [167, 174, "QUANTITY"], [175, 189, "INGREDIENT"], [190, 196, "QUANTITY"], [197, 200, "INGREDIENT"], [201, 207, "QUANTITY"], [208, 219, "INGREDIENT"], [220, 226, "QUANTITY"], [227, 232, "INGREDIENT"], [233, 243, "QUANTITY"], [244, 249, "INGREDIENT"], [270, 283, "INGREDIENT"], [288, 299, "INGREDIENT"], [301, 306, "QUANTITY"], [307, 315, "INGREDIENT"], [342, 345, "PROCESS"], [350, 355, "INGREDIENT"], [357, 367, "INGREDIENT"], [369, 381, "INGREDIENT"], [383, 396, "INGREDIENT"], [398, 402, "INGREDIENT"], [408, 416, "INGREDIENT"], [450, 453, "PROCESS"], [458, 472, "INGREDIENT"], [474, 477, "INGREDIENT"], [479, 490, "INGREDIENT"], [496, 501, "INGREDIENT"], [522, 527, "INGREDIENT"], [576, 579, "PROCESS"], [655, 661, "PROCESS"], [699, 704, "INGREDIENT"], [742, 747, "PROCESS"], [818, 826, "PROCESS"], [852, 860, "INGREDIENT"], [905, 913, "PROCESS"], [950, 953, "PROCESS"], [958, 963, "INGREDIENT"], [968, 976, "INGREDIENT"], [1019, 1027, "PROCESS"], [1243, 1249, "PROCESS"], [1416, 1422, "PROCESS"], [1681, 1684, "INGREDIENT"], [1690, 1693, "INGREDIENT"], [1720, 1728, "INGREDIENT"], [1733, 1747, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
