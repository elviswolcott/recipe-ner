["Ingredients:\n1 cup warm water, almost too hot for comfort (110 degrees)\n1 envelope rapid rise or instant yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons)\n1 tbsp sugar\n2 3/4 cup white whole wheat flour\n1/4 cup nutritional yeast\n1 tsp salt\npizza sauce, or tomato sauce\nnon-dairy cheese, optional *I prefer daiya brand\nvegetables of choice- green peppers, red onion, tomatoes, etc.\ntempeh sausage, optional\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat oven to 425 degrees.\nQuick whisk the warm water, yeast and sugar in a large bowl, or your standing mixer bowl if using. Allow it to sit for 5 minutes, it should puff up a bit.\nAdd the flour, nutritional yeast and salt to the bowl. If using a standing mixer, use the dough hook on setting 2 for 5 minutes. If kneading by hand, mix everything together with a wooden spoon until combined, then knead on a lightly floured surface for about 5 minutes until you have a smooth ball of dough.\nHalve the dough. On a lightly floured surface (I just use my countertop), roll out the dough pretty thin, about 11 inches in diameter or to fit your pizza pans. You should get two good sized pizzas.\nIf you don't have good non-stick pans, you may need to lightly spray them with oil to prevent sticking. Use as little as possible if needed. Transfer the dough to the baking pans.\nNow you can add your pizza sauce, veggies and other optional toppings. Bake for 8 minutes for a soft, chewy crust or 10 minutes for a crispier crust.&nbsp;", {"entities": [[13, 18, "QUANTITY"], [19, 57, "INGREDIENT"], [97, 110, "INGREDIENT"], [112, 127, "QUANTITY"], [129, 135, "QUANTITY"], [136, 141, "INGREDIENT"], [142, 151, "QUANTITY"], [152, 175, "INGREDIENT"], [176, 183, "QUANTITY"], [184, 201, "INGREDIENT"], [202, 207, "QUANTITY"], [208, 212, "INGREDIENT"], [213, 224, "INGREDIENT"], [229, 241, "INGREDIENT"], [291, 301, "INGREDIENT"], [328, 337, "INGREDIENT"], [339, 347, "INGREDIENT"], [354, 360, "INGREDIENT"], [429, 434, "PROCESS"], [439, 449, "INGREDIENT"], [451, 456, "INGREDIENT"], [461, 466, "INGREDIENT"], [586, 591, "INGREDIENT"], [593, 610, "INGREDIENT"], [615, 619, "INGREDIENT"], [728, 731, "PROCESS"], [793, 798, "PROCESS"], [987, 991, "PROCESS"], [1165, 1168, "INGREDIENT"], [1253, 1259, "PROCESS"], [1274, 1277, "INGREDIENT"], [1278, 1281, "PROCESS"], [1287, 1298, "INGREDIENT"], [1300, 1307, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
