["Ingredients:\n2 cups all purpose flour\n1/3 cup brown sugar, packed\n2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice mix\n1 teaspoon baking powder\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n1/2 cup vegan butter (earth balance brand preferred), cold and cut into small cubes or pieces\n1/2 cup pumpkin puree\n2 tablespoons almond milk\n1/4 cup applesauce\n1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract\n1 cup powdered sugar\n1-2 tablespoons almond milk\n1 cup powdered sugar\n1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice mix\n1-2 tablespoons almond milk\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees F and lightly grease a large baking sheet (or line with parchment paper).\nIn a large bowl, combine the flour, brown sugar, pumpkin pie spice mix, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Add the cold vegan butter, and use a pastry cutter or your hands to work the butter into the dry ingredients. It should resemble coarse crumbs.\nNow dump in the pumpkin puree, almond milk, applesauce and vanilla. Mix with a large wooden spoon until a soft dough forms.\nOn a lightly floured surface, knead the dough a few times until it comes together. Flatten the dough with your hands (lightly flour your hands if sticky). Flatten it into a circle, about 1 inch thick.\nUsing a pizza cutter or large knife, cut it like you would a pizza, into 8 pieces (see photos above for reference).\nPlace on prepared baking sheet and bake for 14-16 minutes, until lightly golden brown on top.", {"entities": [[13, 19, "QUANTITY"], [20, 37, "INGREDIENT"], [38, 45, "QUANTITY"], [46, 65, "INGREDIENT"], [66, 77, "QUANTITY"], [78, 99, "INGREDIENT"], [100, 110, "QUANTITY"], [111, 124, "INGREDIENT"], [125, 137, "QUANTITY"], [138, 149, "INGREDIENT"], [150, 162, "QUANTITY"], [163, 167, "INGREDIENT"], [168, 175, "QUANTITY"], [176, 188, "INGREDIENT"], [262, 269, "QUANTITY"], [270, 283, "INGREDIENT"], [284, 297, "QUANTITY"], [298, 309, "INGREDIENT"], [310, 317, "QUANTITY"], [318, 328, "INGREDIENT"], [329, 341, "QUANTITY"], [342, 362, "INGREDIENT"], [363, 368, "QUANTITY"], [369, 383, "INGREDIENT"], [386, 399, "QUANTITY"], [400, 411, "INGREDIENT"], [412, 417, "QUANTITY"], [418, 432, "INGREDIENT"], [433, 445, "QUANTITY"], [446, 467, "INGREDIENT"], [470, 483, "QUANTITY"], [484, 495, "INGREDIENT"], [572, 578, "PROCESS"], [646, 651, "INGREDIENT"], [653, 664, "INGREDIENT"], [666, 687, "INGREDIENT"], [689, 702, "INGREDIENT"], [704, 715, "INGREDIENT"], [720, 725, "INGREDIENT"], [734, 751, "INGREDIENT"], [803, 809, "INGREDIENT"], [874, 878, "PROCESS"], [886, 899, "INGREDIENT"], [901, 913, "INGREDIENT"], [914, 924, "INGREDIENT"], [929, 936, "INGREDIENT"], [1024, 1029, "PROCESS"], [1120, 1125, "INGREDIENT"], [1329, 1335, "PROCESS"], [1346, 1350, "PROCESS"]]}]
