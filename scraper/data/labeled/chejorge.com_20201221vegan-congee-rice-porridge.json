["Ingredients:\n1 cup short- grain white rice (Japanese, Chinese, Taiwanese varieties)\n10 cups water\n2 inches ginger, sliced\n1.5 teaspoons fine salt\n5  fresh shiitake mushrooms\nscallions, thinly chopped\nChinese parsley\nfried shallots (as made in this recipe)\npicked vegetables (radish, mustard greens, etc.)\nvegan You Tiao (Chinese fried dough stick)\nchili oil (homemade recipe HERE)\nsoy sauce, I prefer dark soy sauce\ntoasted sesame seeds\nwhite pepper\n\nInstructions:\nPrepare the Rice. For this recipe, I usually use Japanese, Chinese, or Taiwanese short-grained white rice. Wash the rice very thoroughly. Drain & set aside.\nMake the Congee. Start by bringing water to boil on the stove. Note: Stove-top cooking is the preferred method. Using a rice-cooker will not yield the same result! Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the rice, sliced ginger, and salt. Reduce to a simmer and let cook covered for about 30-45 minutes, stirring occasionally to make sure nothing sticks to the bottom. Cook until rice is soft & the porridge reaches a thick, creamy consistency. Note: you can add more water and continue cooking to adjust consistency.\nPrepare Toppings. If you just eat this congee by itself, it will taste very bland! Use toppings listed in the ingredients to customize the congee to your liking. Refer to the notes below if you would like to make a mushroom-flavored congee (i.e. amplify the mushroom flavor).
