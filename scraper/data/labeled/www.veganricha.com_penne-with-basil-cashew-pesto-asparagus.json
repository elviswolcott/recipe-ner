["Ingredients:\n1 cup penne cooked according to instructions\n7-8  asparagus spears (halved)\n1/2  red bell pepper (sliced into rings)\n2  garlic cloves chopped\n1 teaspoon canola oil\n1 teaspoon olive oil\nchopped tomatoes (for garnish)\n2 cups fresh basil\n1/2 cup raw cashew\nolive oil\n3 cloves of garlic\n1  green chili or dried red chili pepper ((we like a bit of spice))\nsalt to taste\n\nInstructions:\nFor the pesto, wash the basil and add to blender and blend for a minute\nIn a small pan, add a tablespoon of olive oil. Keep at low heat and add garlic cloves and green chili. Let cook for a minute.\nAdd in the cashews and let cook for another minute or 2.\nAdd this mixture to the blender and blend. Keep adding olive oil to get a smooth paste. My blender always gets me a coarse paste, so I added a little water as well, since I was going to use up the pesto within the week, or freeze it in ice cubes! Adjust chilis, garlic and basil by taste. This pesto is very forgiving, so play with it!. For basil mint pesto, I use about half cup mint.\nIn a large pan, add regular oil and the halved/sliced asparagus(for quicker cooking) and saute for 5-8 minutes on medium low heat.\nAdd in the garlic and red bell pepper rings and olive oil and saute for another 3-4 minutes.\nAdd in the cooked penne or any pasta of choice and pesto and mix well.\nAdjust for salt and pepper. We needed just a teeny bit of salt.\nLet cook for a minute.\nServe hot topped with fresh chopped tomatoes!", {"entities": [[13, 18, "QUANTITY"], [19, 57, "INGREDIENT"], [94, 109, "INGREDIENT"], [133, 139, "INGREDIENT"], [140, 146, "INGREDIENT"], [147, 154, "INGREDIENT"], [155, 165, "QUANTITY"], [166, 176, "INGREDIENT"], [177, 187, "QUANTITY"], [188, 197, "INGREDIENT"], [198, 214, "INGREDIENT"], [229, 235, "QUANTITY"], [236, 247, "INGREDIENT"], [248, 255, "QUANTITY"], [256, 266, "INGREDIENT"], [267, 276, "INGREDIENT"], [279, 285, "INGREDIENT"], [289, 295, "INGREDIENT"], [330, 336, "INGREDIENT"], [356, 361, "INGREDIENT"], [364, 377, "INGREDIENT"], [417, 422, "INGREDIENT"], [427, 430, "PROCESS"], [481, 484, "PROCESS"], [501, 510, "INGREDIENT"], [533, 536, "PROCESS"], [537, 543, "INGREDIENT"], [544, 550, "INGREDIENT"], [572, 576, "PROCESS"], [602, 609, "INGREDIENT"], [618, 622, "PROCESS"], [696, 702, "PROCESS"], [703, 712, "INGREDIENT"], [729, 734, "INGREDIENT"], [771, 776, "INGREDIENT"], [783, 788, "PROCESS"], [798, 803, "INGREDIENT"], [884, 893, "INGREDIENT"], [910, 916, "INGREDIENT"], [921, 926, "INGREDIENT"], [989, 994, "INGREDIENT"], [995, 999, "INGREDIENT"], [1024, 1027, "QUANTITY"], [1028, 1032, "INGREDIENT"], [1050, 1053, "PROCESS"], [1062, 1065, "INGREDIENT"], [1110, 1117, "PROCESS"], [1123, 1128, "PROCESS"], [1176, 1182, "INGREDIENT"], [1187, 1202, "INGREDIENT"], [1213, 1222, "INGREDIENT"], [1227, 1232, "PROCESS"], [1269, 1275, "INGREDIENT"], [1276, 1281, "INGREDIENT"], [1289, 1304, "INGREDIENT"], [1319, 1322, "PROCESS"], [1340, 1344, "INGREDIENT"], [1349, 1355, "INGREDIENT"], [1384, 1391, "INGREDIENT"], [1397, 1401, "PROCESS"], [1438, 1443, "INGREDIENT"], [1444, 1460, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
