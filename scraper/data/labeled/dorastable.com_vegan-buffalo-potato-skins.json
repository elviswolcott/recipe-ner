Place the soy curls in a heat proof bowl and pour the broth on them. Using a large spoon, press down so the soy curls absorb all the liquid.\nOnce the soy curls cool down a bit, squeeze all the liquid you can out of them. Place a third of the soy curls in the blender and process on low, until the soy curls are shredded. Repeat with the rest of the soy curls.\nHeat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and saut\u00c3\u00a9 until translucent. Stir in shredded soy curls and saut\u00c3\u00a9 until it browns slightly. Lower heat and add almond crema, Buffalo sauce, and green onions. Stir to combine. Season to taste. Remove from heat and set aside.\nRemove potatoes from air fryer and let cool slightly. Cut in half horizontally and scoop out the insides leaving about 1/4 inch of potato on the skin.\nMash the potato insides with a fork and mix them in with the soy curl mixture.\nSpray the potato skins with avocado oil and air fry them for 15 min, flipping them half way through.\nFill the potato skins with the Buffalo soy curls and place under the oven broiler for 2 minutes.
