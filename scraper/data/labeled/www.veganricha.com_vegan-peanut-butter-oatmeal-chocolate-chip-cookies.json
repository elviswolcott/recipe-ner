Add spices such as cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice if you wish\nAdd more flour if the mixture is too sticky. Depends on the flour and the nut butter.

Use a 1.5 tbsp cookie scooop and scoop onto parchment lined baking sheet.&nbsp;\nPress each scoop down to flatten. Add some chocolate chips on top if needed.\nBake at 350 F for 12 to 14 mins, longer for crispier. Cool for 5 mins, then remove from the pan and cool completely.Store on the counter for upto 5 days. Refrigerate for freshness for upto 2 weeks.&nbsp;", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 41, "INGREDIENT"], [42, 49, "QUANTITY"], [50, 61, "INGREDIENT"], [62, 68, "QUANTITY"], [69, 90, "INGREDIENT"], [117, 124, "INGREDIENT"], [126, 131, "QUANTITY"], [132, 147, "INGREDIENT"], [148, 155, "QUANTITY"], [156, 174, "INGREDIENT"], [215, 222, "QUANTITY"], [223, 228, "INGREDIENT"], [240, 243, "PROCESS"], [274, 283, "INGREDIENT"], [312, 319, "QUANTITY"], [320, 331, "INGREDIENT"], [332, 344, "INGREDIENT"], [345, 352, "QUANTITY"], [353, 374, "INGREDIENT"], [399, 406, "INGREDIENT"], [408, 416, "INGREDIENT"], [418, 429, "INGREDIENT"], [433, 444, "INGREDIENT"], [452, 461, "INGREDIENT"], [485, 491, "PROCESS"], [567, 580, "INGREDIENT"], [582, 587, "INGREDIENT"], [589, 610, "INGREDIENT"], [615, 622, "INGREDIENT"], [676, 685, "INGREDIENT"], [700, 710, "INGREDIENT"], [711, 714, "PROCESS"], [740, 751, "INGREDIENT"], [756, 760, "INGREDIENT"], [766, 773, "QUANTITY"], [774, 779, "INGREDIENT"], [789, 794, "PROCESS"], [795, 800, "INGREDIENT"], [805, 809, "INGREDIENT"], [817, 827, "INGREDIENT"], [837, 840, "PROCESS"], [866, 895, "INGREDIENT"], [917, 922, "INGREDIENT"], [968, 973, "INGREDIENT"], [982, 992, "INGREDIENT"], [1006, 1012, "QUANTITY"], [1033, 1042, "INGREDIENT"], [1142, 1148, "PROCESS"], [1168, 1172, "INGREDIENT"], [1205, 1220, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
