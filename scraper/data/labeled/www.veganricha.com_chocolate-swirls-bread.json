The chocolate dough will be about 1/8 inch thick and the regular dough about a 1/4 inch thick. Use extra flour if necessary.\nPlace the chocolate dough on top on the regular dough square.\nFold them together twice to get a smaller square.\nRoll them out again to about 10 inches square.\nRoll them like a jelly roll from one side tightly and seal the open side to the roll with water.\nPlace the roll on a greased baking tray with the sealed side down.\nMake deep cuts on the roll an inch apart. Step by step and pictorial for similar shaping here\nSpray some oil on top and cover with damp towel.
