["Ingredients:\n1-2 tablespoons olive oil\n1/2  onion, diced small\n2  cloves garlic, minced\n3/4 teaspoon salt\n2 cups cooked green lentils\n2 cups water\n8 ounces spaghetti\n1 jar (25.5) ounces vegan marinara sauce\n\nInstructions:\nPress the saute button on the Instant Pot. When hot, add the olive oil, onion and garlic. Cook, stirring, for about 3 minutes until the onion in translucent. Now add the salt and cooked lentils. Stir, then turn off the saute.\nPour the water in and using a spatula, de-glaze the bottom of the pan to get any stuck bits off the bottom (this helps to avoid the \"burn\" message.) Add the spaghetti noodles, broken in half. Then pour the marinara on top of the noodles, and push the noodles into the liquid to cover. Don't stir.\nPlace the lid on, seal and set to high pressure for 9 minutes.\nDo a quick release so the pasta won't overcook. Stir everything together, then serve with vegan parmesan and bread if desired!", {"entities": [[15, 28, "QUANTITY"], [29, 38, "INGREDIENT"], [44, 49, "INGREDIENT"], [51, 56, "INGREDIENT"], [66, 72, "INGREDIENT"], [73, 79, "INGREDIENT"], [81, 87, "INGREDIENT"], [88, 100, "QUANTITY"], [101, 105, "INGREDIENT"], [106, 112, "QUANTITY"], [113, 133, "INGREDIENT"], [134, 140, "QUANTITY"], [141, 146, "INGREDIENT"], [147, 155, "QUANTITY"], [156, 165, "INGREDIENT"], [192, 206, "INGREDIENT"], [232, 237, "PROCESS"], [275, 278, "PROCESS"], [283, 292, "INGREDIENT"], [294, 299, "INGREDIENT"], [304, 310, "INGREDIENT"], [318, 326, "PROCESS"], [358, 363, "INGREDIENT"], [384, 387, "PROCESS"], [392, 396, "INGREDIENT"], [401, 415, "INGREDIENT"], [441, 446, "PROCESS"], [457, 462, "INGREDIENT"], [605, 622, "INGREDIENT"], [739, 743, "PROCESS"], [834, 839, "INGREDIENT"], [898, 912, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
