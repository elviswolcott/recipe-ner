["Ingredients:\n1/2 cup mashed banana (| about 1 medium banana)\n1 cup soy milk\n2 tablespoons canola oil\n2 tablespoons granulated sugar\n1 teaspoon vanilla\n1 1/2 cups flour (| white, whole wheat pastry or white whole wheat)\n1 tablespoon baking powder\n1/2 teaspoon salt\noptional: 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon\n\nInstructions:\nIn a medium bowl, mash the banana. Use a measuring cup to make sure you have about 1/2 cup mashed banana.&nbsp;\nNow add the soy milk, oil, sugar and vanilla. Whisk until well combined.\nAdd the flour to the wet ingredients, then sprinkle the baking powder, salt and cinnamon (if using) on top of the flour. Mix until just combined with a wooden spoon. The batter will be lumpy.\nHeat a large griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Drop about 1/3 cup of the batter onto the griddle. Cook until bubbles form, then flip and cook until golden brown on the other side, about 1-2 minutes. Repeat with all the remaining batter.\nServe with vegan butter, pure maple syrup and more sliced bananas. These pancakes freeze well, and the recipe can be easily double, tripled or quadrupled.", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 34, "INGREDIENT"], [61, 66, "QUANTITY"], [67, 75, "INGREDIENT"], [76, 89, "QUANTITY"], [90, 100, "INGREDIENT"], [101, 114, "QUANTITY"], [115, 131, "INGREDIENT"], [132, 142, "QUANTITY"], [143, 150, "INGREDIENT"], [151, 161, "QUANTITY"], [162, 167, "INGREDIENT"], [178, 189, "INGREDIENT"], [206, 217, "INGREDIENT"], [219, 231, "QUANTITY"], [232, 245, "INGREDIENT"], [246, 258, "QUANTITY"], [259, 263, "INGREDIENT"], [274, 286, "QUANTITY"], [287, 295, "INGREDIENT"], [362, 365, "QUANTITY"], [394, 401, "QUANTITY"], [402, 408, "INGREDIENT"], [427, 430, "PROCESS"], [435, 443, "INGREDIENT"], [445, 448, "INGREDIENT"], [450, 455, "INGREDIENT"], [460, 467, "INGREDIENT"], [504, 509, "INGREDIENT"], [539, 547, "PROCESS"], [552, 565, "INGREDIENT"], [567, 571, "INGREDIENT"], [576, 584, "INGREDIENT"], [610, 615, "INGREDIENT"], [750, 757, "QUANTITY"], [829, 833, "PROCESS"], [940, 952, "INGREDIENT"], [954, 970, "INGREDIENT"], [1039, 1042, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
