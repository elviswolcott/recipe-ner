Blend for a minute, then let the mixture rest for 2 mins, then blend again until very smooth and silky,\nTaste and adjust the sweet and tang and mix. Transfer to a bowl.\nIn the same blender (no need to wash), Blend the cocoa coffee layer filling until smooth. Blend for a minute, then let the mixture rest for 2 mins, then blend again. Taste and adjust sweet and flavor if needed. I make these bars mildly sweet, so add sweet if needed, and blend in.\nLine a loaf pan with parchment. Pour the coffee cocoa mixture in and even it out. Freeze for 20 to 30 mins.\nPour the mascarpone mixture on top and even it out. Sprinkle shaved chocolate or cocoa powder on top and freeze for 2 hours or longer. Then slice and store. I prefer to slice these into small bite size pieces. Serve after thawing for 5 mins or when they are soft enough to bite or use a spoon but not melting. .", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 39, "INGREDIENT"], [41, 47, "INGREDIENT"], [82, 89, "QUANTITY"], [90, 95, "INGREDIENT"], [96, 103, "QUANTITY"], [104, 111, "INGREDIENT"], [127, 132, "QUANTITY"], [133, 152, "INGREDIENT"], [153, 160, "QUANTITY"], [161, 165, "INGREDIENT"], [166, 172, "QUANTITY"], [173, 207, "INGREDIENT"], [208, 214, "QUANTITY"], [215, 226, "INGREDIENT"], [275, 293, "INGREDIENT"], [304, 318, "INGREDIENT"], [330, 336, "QUANTITY"], [337, 349, "INGREDIENT"], [351, 357, "QUANTITY"], [375, 382, "QUANTITY"], [383, 392, "INGREDIENT"], [426, 433, "QUANTITY"], [434, 448, "INGREDIENT"], [450, 456, "INGREDIENT"], [491, 497, "QUANTITY"], [498, 509, "INGREDIENT"], [531, 538, "QUANTITY"], [539, 544, "INGREDIENT"], [545, 551, "QUANTITY"], [552, 586, "INGREDIENT"], [587, 594, "QUANTITY"], [595, 599, "INGREDIENT"], [600, 607, "QUANTITY"], [608, 647, "INGREDIENT"], [658, 663, "INGREDIENT"], [673, 686, "INGREDIENT"], [698, 712, "INGREDIENT"], [723, 726, "PROCESS"], [733, 740, "INGREDIENT"], [753, 756, "INGREDIENT"], [982, 985, "PROCESS"], [1056, 1061, "INGREDIENT"], [1253, 1256, "PROCESS"], [1336, 1341, "INGREDIENT"], [1464, 1473, "INGREDIENT"], [1477, 1489, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
