["Ingredients:\n1 1/2 cups uncooked brown rice\n2  medium sweet potatoes\n5-6 ounces chopped kale (half of a 10 oz bag)\n(1) 15-ounce can black beans\n1 1/2 cups raw cashews\n1 cup water\n1  garlic clove\n3/4 teaspoon salt\nOptional: Sriracha hot sauce\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees F.\nCook the rice: Rinse the rice and place it in a medium pot with a lid. Add 3 cups of water and bring to a boil, then simmer on low for 40 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.\nWhile the rice is cooking, roast the sweet potatoes: Line a baking pan with parchment paper. Peel and chop the sweet potatoes into 1 inch chunks and place on the pan. Spray lightly with oil or toss with a few tablespoons of olive oil (or omit for oil free) and roast in the oven for 25-30 minutes, until cooked and lightly brown. Remove and set aside.\nSteam the kale: If you have an Instant Pot, add 1 cup of water to the inner pot and the kale. Secure the lid, make sure it's sealed and cook on high for 3 minutes. Let pressure release, then carefully remove the lid. *Without an Instant Pot, steam the kale in a large pot for 8-10 minutes, until tender.\nDrain and rinse the black beans and set aside.\nMake the cashew cream: Soak the cashews in boiling hot water (I heat the water up in a tea kettle and then pour over the cashews) for at least 5 minutes. Drain, then add to a blender with 1 cup of water, garlic and salt. Blend until very smooth.&nbsp;\nTo assemble the meal prep bowls: In 3-4 cup containers, add about 1/2 cup of cooked rice. Now add 1/3 cup black beans, divide the sweet potatoes and kale into the 5 containers.\u00c2\u00a0\nOptions: Now, you can either add the cashew cream on the top OR keep it in separate small containers and pour the cream on after you re-heat the bowl. I prefer to keep the cream separate until eating, but either way works.&nbsp;\nWhen you are ready to eat, simply warm up the bowl, drizzle with cashew cream and Sriracha.
