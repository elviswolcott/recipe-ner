["Ingredients:\n1/2 cup vegan butter, melted\n1 1/2 cups granulated sugar\n2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract\n1/4 cup soy milk\n1 cup gluten free all purpose flour (I used Bob&#039;s Red Mill 1:1)\n3/4 cup dark cocoa powder\n1 teaspoon baking powder\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n3/4 cup non-dairy chocolate chunks or chips\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat oven to 350. Line a 8x8 inch pan with parchment paper and set aside.\nIn a large bowl, stir together the hot melted butter and sugar until well combined, then stir in the vanilla and milk.\nTo the bowl with the wet ingredients, add the flour, cocoa (sift it in if chunky), baking powder and salt. Stir until just combined, but do not over mix. The mixture will be quite thick, but just keep going and it will come together.\nFold in the chocolate chunks/chips. Dump the thick brownie batter into the pan and smooth it out with a spatula or your hands. Bake for 30 minutes. They will still appear undercooked in the middle and may be a little jiggly, but they firm up as they cool. If you over bake they will turn out very hard instead of fudgy.\nRemove and let cool for 15 minutes in the pan, then use the parchment paper to pull them out of the pan and let cool on a rack for at least 30 minutes if possible before slicing and serving. This will help them firm up and become easier to cut, but if you can&#039;t wait that long it&#039;s okay, they will just be more fudgy and melty, so use a fork and a plate!\nEnjoy! Leftover brownies will keep for about 3 days in a covered container. They also freeze well.", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 41, "INGREDIENT"], [42, 52, "QUANTITY"], [53, 69, "INGREDIENT"], [70, 81, "QUANTITY"], [82, 102, "INGREDIENT"], [103, 110, "QUANTITY"], [111, 119, "INGREDIENT"], [120, 125, "QUANTITY"], [126, 155, "INGREDIENT"], [189, 196, "QUANTITY"], [197, 214, "INGREDIENT"], [215, 225, "QUANTITY"], [226, 239, "INGREDIENT"], [240, 252, "QUANTITY"], [253, 257, "INGREDIENT"], [258, 265, "QUANTITY"], [266, 301, "INGREDIENT"], [411, 415, "PROCESS"], [433, 446, "INGREDIENT"], [451, 456, "INGREDIENT"], [483, 487, "PROCESS"], [495, 502, "INGREDIENT"], [507, 511, "INGREDIENT"], [551, 554, "PROCESS"], [559, 564, "INGREDIENT"], [566, 571, "INGREDIENT"], [596, 609, "INGREDIENT"], [614, 619, "INGREDIENT"], [662, 665, "PROCESS"], [759, 768, "INGREDIENT"], [1015, 1019, "PROCESS"]]}]
