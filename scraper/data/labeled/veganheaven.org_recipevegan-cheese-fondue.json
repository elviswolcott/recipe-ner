["Ingredients:\n3/4 cup white wine\n3/4 cup nutritional yeast\n1/2 cup vegetable broth\n3/4 cup unsweetend almond or soy milk\n1 tablespoon white miso paste\n1  clove of garlic, minced\n1-2 tablespoons mustard\n1 teaspoon tahini\n1 pinch pepper\n1 pinch salt\n1 pinch nutmeg\n4 tablespoons flour\nFrench baguette\nmushrooms\ngrapes\n\nInstructions:\nPut all ingredients (except for the flour) in a pot and cook for about 5 minutes.\nThen stir in the flour and wait until it all thickens up. If it's too thick add some more plant-based milk. If it's too thin add more flour. When it's ready, you can either transfer it to a caquelon or just use a regular bowl instead. However, it's better to use a real fondue pot, a so-called caquelon, as it keeps the cheese sauce hot.", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 31, "INGREDIENT"], [32, 39, "QUANTITY"], [40, 57, "INGREDIENT"], [58, 65, "QUANTITY"], [66, 81, "INGREDIENT"], [82, 89, "QUANTITY"], [90, 119, "INGREDIENT"], [120, 132, "QUANTITY"], [133, 149, "INGREDIENT"], [162, 168, "INGREDIENT"], [170, 176, "INGREDIENT"], [179, 192, "QUANTITY"], [193, 200, "INGREDIENT"], [201, 211, "QUANTITY"], [212, 218, "INGREDIENT"], [227, 233, "INGREDIENT"], [242, 246, "INGREDIENT"], [255, 261, "INGREDIENT"], [262, 275, "QUANTITY"], [276, 281, "INGREDIENT"], [298, 307, "INGREDIENT"], [366, 371, "INGREDIENT"], [386, 390, "PROCESS"], [417, 421, "PROCESS"], [429, 434, "INGREDIENT"], [488, 491, "PROCESS"], [502, 518, "INGREDIENT"], [532, 536, "PROCESS"], [537, 540, "PROCESS"], [546, 551, "INGREDIENT"], [574, 577, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
