["Ingredients:\n8 ounce bag soy curls\n2 tablespoons cornstarch\n1 pound broccoli florets\n1-3 tablespoons olive oil\n2 tablespoons kitchen bouquet, optional for browning\n1/2 cup low sodium soy sauce (*use tamari for gluten free)\n2 tablespoons kitchen bouquet, optional\n3 tablespoons brown sugar\n1/3 cup water\n1 teaspoon red chili flakes\n1 tablespoon grated ginger\n5 cloves minced garlic\n2 tablespoons cornstarch\ncooked brown or white rice, about 4-5 cups cooked\nchopped green onions\nsesame seeds\nadditional chili flakes or hot sauce\n\nInstructions:\nIn a large bowl, add the dehydrated soy curls, then cover with about 4 cups of hot water. Let them rehydrate for about 10 minutes until they have grown in size and softened. Drain in a colander and squeeze any excess water from the pieces.\nUsing the same bowl (once empty), add the soy curls back to it, along with the cornstarch and stir to coat. I use my hands to really coat the pieces as much as possible. Set aside.\nMake the sauce: In a small-medium bowl, add all sauce ingredients and whisk until the cornstarch has dissolved. Set aside.\nIn a large saut\u00c3\u00a9 pan or wok, add the broccoli and 1/2 cup water. Turn the heat to high, cover and steam the broccoli for about 2 minutes until bright green and slightly softened. Then remove the broccoli to a plate nearby.\nTo the empty pan, add 1-3 tablespoons of oil, then add the soy curls and fry, stirring frequently for 4-5 minutes until a bit golden and crisp. I also like to add a few tablespoons of kitchen bouquet while frying, which helps make the soy curls nice and brown. Remove from the pan and set on a plate.\u00c2\u00a0You may omit the oil if you have a very good non-stick pan, otherwise the soy curls will stick. Turn the heat down to medium.\nWhisk the sauce once more, then add to the pan with the soy curls. Stir constantly for a minute or two, until the sauce thickens, then add the broccoli back in and stir. Serve immediately over rice topped with sesame seeds and green onions.
