["Ingredients:\n3 cups bread flour\n1-2 cups water (at room temerature)\n1/4 teaspoon (0.8g) instant yeast\n1-2/3 teaspoon (10g) salt\n\nInstructions:\nProof the yeast in 2 tablespoons warm water. Mix all ingredients. Place in well oiled container, covered for 8-12 hours.&nbsp;\nThe dough will be moist and sticky, for shaping you need to scrape it onto a well- floured surface, and lightly flour the top before patting it down gently. Then use a bench scraper to help lift it for shaping. Latex gloves work wonderfully to keep it from sticking to your fingers if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not comfortable with handling super sticky doughs.\nSet the shaped dough on a coarse-weave towel sprinkled amply with bran. No need to sprinkle the top as it should have enough flour from the counter.\nLet rise for another 1.5-2 hours. I baked in stone ware covered with aluminum foil at 450F./230C for 20 minutes, 10 minutes lid off, transferred to a baking sheet and 10 minutes more.", {"entities": [[15, 31, "INGREDIENT"], [34, 40, "QUANTITY"], [41, 46, "INGREDIENT"], [68, 80, "QUANTITY"], [88, 101, "INGREDIENT"], [104, 116, "QUANTITY"], [118, 121, "QUANTITY"], [123, 127, "INGREDIENT"], [153, 158, "INGREDIENT"], [162, 175, "QUANTITY"], [176, 186, "INGREDIENT"], [382, 387, "INGREDIENT"], [681, 685, "INGREDIENT"], [698, 706, "PROCESS"], [740, 745, "INGREDIENT"], [800, 805, "PROCESS"], [914, 920, "PROCESS"]]}]
