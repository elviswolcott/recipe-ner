Then cut them into about 1.5 inch pieces.\nCook the pasta according to the instructions on the package. Rinse with cold water after cooking.\nHeat some oil in a large pan and cook the asparagus on high heat for about 8 minutes.\nIn the meantime, make the dressing. Combine all the ingredients in a small bowl and whisk well.\nWash and cut the strawberries into slices. In a large bowl combine the cooked asparagus, the strawberries, the pasta, and the arugula or baby spinach. Add the dressing and stir well.\nTop the salad off with balsamic reduction (optional).&nbsp;This salad is best served fresh. I don't like storing it for more than two hours in the fridge because the strawberries soak up the dressing very fast and aren't fresh anymore.", {"entities": [[13, 18, "QUANTITY"], [19, 34, "INGREDIENT"], [35, 40, "QUANTITY"], [41, 59, "INGREDIENT"], [60, 64, "QUANTITY"], [65, 92, "INGREDIENT"], [125, 135, "INGREDIENT"], [136, 142, "INGREDIENT"], [160, 183, "INGREDIENT"], [184, 196, "QUANTITY"], [197, 213, "INGREDIENT"], [214, 227, "QUANTITY"], [228, 237, "INGREDIENT"], [238, 250, "QUANTITY"], [251, 269, "INGREDIENT"], [270, 280, "QUANTITY"], [281, 298, "INGREDIENT"], [299, 309, "QUANTITY"], [310, 321, "INGREDIENT"], [322, 334, "QUANTITY"], [335, 339, "INGREDIENT"], [340, 352, "INGREDIENT"], [363, 381, "INGREDIENT"], [513, 518, "INGREDIENT"], [576, 586, "INGREDIENT"], [593, 600, "PROCESS"], [612, 615, "INGREDIENT"], [635, 639, "PROCESS"], [772, 777, "PROCESS"], [801, 813, "INGREDIENT"], [855, 861, "INGREDIENT"], [877, 889, "INGREDIENT"], [895, 900, "INGREDIENT"], [910, 933, "INGREDIENT"], [956, 960, "PROCESS"], [990, 1008, "INGREDIENT"], [1052, 1057, "INGREDIENT"], [1133, 1145, "INGREDIENT"], [1188, 1193, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
