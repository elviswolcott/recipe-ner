["Ingredients:\n1 block (255 g) konjac (Japanese yam cake)\n2 tablespoons vegetable oil, for frying\n1 tablespoon dark soy sauce\n1 tablespoon light soy sauce\n1 tablespoon mirin\n1 teaspoon blackstrap molasses\n1 teaspoon mushroom bouillon\n1 teaspoon rice vinegar\n1  scallion, for topping\n1 pinch shichimi (seven-spice), for topping (optional)\n\nInstructions:\nPrepare the Konjac. Start by filleting the konjac into two thinner slices. Bring a pot of lightly-salted water to boil, and place the konjac slices in. Parboil for 3-5 minutes. Note: This parboiling step is meant to get rid of konjac's natural fishy odor. It also helps also helps firm up the konjac. Drain the konjac slices, and let them cool for a minute. Note: make sure to dry the konjac slices well, so they can develop a good sear later. Score them on both sides, then cut each slice into 1.5-2 cm wide strips.\nPrepare the Seasoning. In a bowl, combine dark soy sauce, light soy sauce, mirin, blackstrap molasses, mushroom bouillon, and rice vinegar. Mix well to combine.\nCook the Konjac. Heat up 1-2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a cast iron or non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Add the konjac steaks into the pan and sear until each side is lightly-golden brown and crisp, about 5-7 minutes. Near the end of cooking, add the prepared seasoning. Note: Be careful not to burn this sauce! Lower the heat if your pan seems too hot. Glaze the steaks nicely and allow flavors to infuse, for about 1 minute, before removing from the pan.\nTo serve. Serve over a bed of white rice with thinly sliced scallions and an optional sprinkle of Japanese seven-spice.
