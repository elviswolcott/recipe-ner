["Ingredients:\n7-8 cups cubed bread (I used a mix of 1 french baguette and cubed whole grain bread)\n1/4 cup walnuts (or use sunflower seeds for nut-free)\n1 teaspoon fennel seeds\n1 teaspoon oregano\n1 teaspoon thyme\n1 teaspoon basil\n1 teaspoon garlic powder\n1/2 teaspoon onion powder\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2-1 teaspoon smoked paprika\n1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n1/4 teaspoon pepper flakes\n15 ounce can of chickpeas drained or 1 1/4 cup cooked\n1/2-1 teaspoon lemon juice\n1 tablespoon oil or vegan butter\n1 1/2 cups chopped onions\n1 1/2 cups chopped celery\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n3/4 teaspoon ground sage\n1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary\n2 to 2 1/2 cups vegetable broth\n\nInstructions:\nToast the bread- Cube up your bread and spread on a large baking sheet.\nPut the baking sheet in the oven at 350 degrees F (180 c) to bake until the bread is dried and is toasty. The bread should just start to get crisp and golden about 12-15 minutes.\nMeanwhile make the chickpea sausage: Add the walnuts and all of the spices to a food processor. Pulse until the walnuts and fennel seeds break down and walnuts are coarse mixture.\nThen add in your chickpeas and lemon juice and pulse again until most of the chickpeas are broken into a coarse mix and set aside.\nIn a pan, heat up 1 tsp butter. Add in the chickpea sausage mixture and cook to crisp up some of the portions of the mixture should start getting golden about 3-5 minutes. Then remove from the pan and set aside.\nAdd 2 tsp oil or butter, then add in the onion and celery and half of the salt and mix. Cook uncovered for 4-5 minutes then cover partially and cook until the onion is soft and golden. It will take 6-8 minutes.\nAssemble the stuffing: Grease a large 9x11 inch baking dish or similar size baking dish. Add your onion celery mixture, the chickpea sausage mixture. Add in the baked bread. Add in the salt, pepper, and sage and rosemary and toss well.\nHeat up your broth until it&#39;s about warm hot and pour it in batches. I pour about 1/2-3/4 cup and mix it in, so that just one portion of the bread doesn&#39;t get all soggy. Continue to mix it in until the mix is evenly moist. Depending on your bread, you might need up to 2.5 cups of broth.\nAlso, it depends on your preference whether you like your stuffing more moist, you can add another 1/4-1/2 cup broth.\nCover the baking dish with foil and then put it in the oven. Bake for 35-40 minutes then remove the foil and continue to bake for another 5-10 minutes or until crisp on top to preference.\nYou can also brush some butter on top if you like the stuffing to get extra crisp and golden, and then broil it for a minute or two.Remove the stuffing from the oven. Let it rest for 5 minutes and then serve.", {"entities": [[15, 21, "QUANTITY"], [22, 33, "INGREDIENT"], [44, 47, "PROCESS"], [73, 78, "INGREDIENT"], [98, 105, "QUANTITY"], [106, 113, "INGREDIENT"], [122, 137, "INGREDIENT"], [152, 162, "QUANTITY"], [163, 175, "INGREDIENT"], [176, 186, "QUANTITY"], [187, 194, "INGREDIENT"], [195, 205, "QUANTITY"], [206, 211, "INGREDIENT"], [212, 222, "QUANTITY"], [223, 228, "INGREDIENT"], [229, 239, "QUANTITY"], [240, 253, "INGREDIENT"], [254, 266, "QUANTITY"], [267, 279, "INGREDIENT"], [280, 292, "QUANTITY"], [293, 297, "INGREDIENT"], [302, 312, "QUANTITY"], [313, 327, "INGREDIENT"], [328, 340, "QUANTITY"], [341, 353, "INGREDIENT"], [354, 366, "QUANTITY"], [367, 380, "INGREDIENT"], [381, 389, "QUANTITY"], [390, 434, "INGREDIENT"], [439, 449, "QUANTITY"], [450, 461, "INGREDIENT"], [462, 474, "QUANTITY"], [475, 494, "INGREDIENT"], [495, 505, "QUANTITY"], [506, 520, "INGREDIENT"], [521, 531, "QUANTITY"], [532, 546, "INGREDIENT"], [547, 559, "QUANTITY"], [560, 564, "INGREDIENT"], [565, 577, "QUANTITY"], [578, 590, "INGREDIENT"], [591, 603, "QUANTITY"], [604, 615, "INGREDIENT"], [616, 628, "QUANTITY"], [629, 643, "INGREDIENT"], [649, 659, "QUANTITY"], [660, 675, "INGREDIENT"], [749, 755, "PROCESS"], [771, 777, "PROCESS"], [824, 828, "PROCESS"], [961, 969, "INGREDIENT"], [987, 994, "INGREDIENT"], [1054, 1061, "INGREDIENT"], [1066, 1078, "INGREDIENT"], [1094, 1101, "INGREDIENT"], [1127, 1130, "PROCESS"], [1139, 1148, "INGREDIENT"], [1153, 1164, "INGREDIENT"], [1199, 1208, "INGREDIENT"], [1234, 1237, "PROCESS"], [1271, 1276, "QUANTITY"], [1277, 1283, "INGREDIENT"], [1296, 1304, "INGREDIENT"], [1325, 1329, "PROCESS"], [1469, 1474, "QUANTITY"], [1475, 1488, "INGREDIENT"], [1495, 1498, "PROCESS"], [1506, 1511, "INGREDIENT"], [1516, 1522, "INGREDIENT"], [1539, 1543, "INGREDIENT"], [1548, 1551, "PROCESS"], [1609, 1613, "PROCESS"], [1624, 1629, "INGREDIENT"], [1724, 1730, "PROCESS"], [1752, 1758, "PROCESS"], [1774, 1779, "INGREDIENT"], [1780, 1786, "INGREDIENT"], [1800, 1808, "INGREDIENT"], [1837, 1842, "PROCESS"], [1861, 1865, "INGREDIENT"], [1867, 1873, "INGREDIENT"], [1879, 1883, "INGREDIENT"], [1888, 1896, "INGREDIENT"], [1925, 1930, "INGREDIENT"], [2002, 2009, "QUANTITY"], [2014, 2017, "PROCESS"], [2102, 2105, "PROCESS"], [2122, 2125, "PROCESS"], [2198, 2206, "INGREDIENT"], [2291, 2294, "INGREDIENT"], [2295, 2298, "PROCESS"], [2311, 2318, "QUANTITY"], [2319, 2324, "INGREDIENT"], [2336, 2342, "PROCESS"], [2447, 2451, "PROCESS"], [2518, 2521, "INGREDIENT"], [2538, 2544, "INGREDIENT"], [2617, 2622, "PROCESS"]]}]
