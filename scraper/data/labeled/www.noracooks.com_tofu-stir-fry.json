["Ingredients:\n1 block  extra-firm tofu (16-oz), pressed (or get the high protein variety that isn't packed in water)\n2-3 tablespoons sesame oil\n3 cloves garlic, minced\n1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger\n1 medium sweet onion, sliced or chopped\n1 large red bell pepper, sliced or chopped\n1 large carrot, peeled and sliced\n2 cups broccoli florets\n1/3 cup low sodium soy sauce (OR tamari for gluten free)\n1/4 cup pure maple syrup or agave\n1/4 cup fresh lime juice (about 2 limes)\n1-2 teaspoons Sriracha hot sauce\n2-3 cups cooked rice, white or brown\nchopped green onions, optional\ncashews, peanuts or sesame seeds, optional\n\nInstructions:\nPress the tofu:&nbsp;Wrap the block of tofu in paper towels. Place a plate or pan on top of the wrapped tofu, and put a couple of heavy books on top of that. Let the tofu press for 20-30 minutes. You can skip this step if you buy the high protein, super firm variety, which I recommend.\nAfter pressing the tofu, chop it into 1/2 inch cubes. Slice/chop the garlic, ginger, onion, red bell pepper, carrot and broccoli florets. In a bowl, whisk together the sauce ingredients. Have everything close to the stove and ready to go.\nIn a large pan or wok, heat the sesame oil over medium-high heat. Add the tofu, and fry it for 5-10 minutes, until all sides are golden brown.\nTo the pan with the tofu, add the onion, garlic and ginger and stir for about 1 minute.\nAdd the red bell pepper, carrots and broccoli and cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring constantly.\nPour in the stir fry sauce, stir and cook for 1-2 minutes. Serve immediately with chopped green onions, sesame seeds, cashew pieces or peanuts, if desired.", {"entities": [[22, 37, "INGREDIENT"], [47, 54, "PROCESS"], [99, 105, "INGREDIENT"], [109, 114, "INGREDIENT"], [118, 131, "QUANTITY"], [132, 142, "INGREDIENT"], [145, 151, "INGREDIENT"], [152, 158, "INGREDIENT"], [160, 166, "INGREDIENT"], [167, 177, "QUANTITY"], [178, 197, "INGREDIENT"], [213, 218, "INGREDIENT"], [230, 237, "INGREDIENT"], [246, 261, "INGREDIENT"], [273, 280, "INGREDIENT"], [289, 295, "INGREDIENT"], [315, 321, "QUANTITY"], [322, 338, "INGREDIENT"], [339, 346, "QUANTITY"], [347, 367, "INGREDIENT"], [372, 378, "INGREDIENT"], [396, 403, "QUANTITY"], [404, 429, "INGREDIENT"], [430, 437, "QUANTITY"], [438, 454, "INGREDIENT"], [473, 484, "QUANTITY"], [485, 503, "INGREDIENT"], [506, 512, "QUANTITY"], [513, 540, "INGREDIENT"], [541, 561, "INGREDIENT"], [572, 579, "INGREDIENT"], [581, 588, "INGREDIENT"], [592, 604, "INGREDIENT"], [669, 673, "INGREDIENT"], [734, 738, "INGREDIENT"], [796, 800, "INGREDIENT"], [801, 806, "PROCESS"], [830, 833, "INGREDIENT"], [923, 931, "PROCESS"], [936, 940, "INGREDIENT"], [986, 992, "INGREDIENT"], [994, 1000, "INGREDIENT"], [1002, 1007, "INGREDIENT"], [1009, 1024, "INGREDIENT"], [1026, 1032, "INGREDIENT"], [1037, 1053, "INGREDIENT"], [1066, 1071, "PROCESS"], [1188, 1198, "INGREDIENT"], [1230, 1234, "INGREDIENT"], [1240, 1243, "PROCESS"], [1319, 1323, "INGREDIENT"], [1325, 1328, "PROCESS"], [1333, 1338, "INGREDIENT"], [1340, 1346, "INGREDIENT"], [1351, 1357, "INGREDIENT"], [1362, 1366, "PROCESS"], [1395, 1410, "INGREDIENT"], [1412, 1419, "INGREDIENT"], [1424, 1432, "INGREDIENT"], [1437, 1441, "PROCESS"], [1459, 1467, "PROCESS"], [1492, 1496, "PROCESS"], [1497, 1500, "PROCESS"], [1508, 1512, "PROCESS"], [1517, 1521, "PROCESS"], [1562, 1582, "INGREDIENT"], [1584, 1596, "INGREDIENT"], [1615, 1622, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
