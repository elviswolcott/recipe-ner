["Ingredients:\n1  large zucchini grated - about 1.25 cups\n1/2 cup raw or other sugar (I usually use 1/3 cup for a less sweet breakfast loaf)\n1/4 cup water\n1 tsp vanilla extract\n1.5 tbsp chia seeds\n2 tbsp oil\n1/2 tsp vinegar (apple cider or white)\n3 tbsp maple syrup\n3/4 cup old fashioned oats (use certified gluten-free if needed)\n1/2 cup almond flour\n1/2 cup oat flour (use certified gluten-free if needed)\n1/4 cup white rice flour\n1/4 cup potato starch\n2 tbsp tapioca starch\n2 tsp baking powder\n1/4 tsp salt\n1/2 tsp cinnamon (optional)\n\nInstructions:\nGrate the zucchini and add to a large bowl. Add the rest of the wet ingredients and mix well until the sugar dissolves in. Chill the mixture for half an hour.\nFold in the oats into the bowl and chill for another 10 minutes. Preheat the oven to 365 degrees F / 180c. Line a 8.5 by 4.5 inch loaf pan with parchment or grease it well.\nIn a bowl, whisk the rest of the dry ingredients really well. Add it to the wet bowl and fold in well. The batter should be thick. if the batter is too flowy, add in a tbsp or so more rice flour.\nDrop this thick mixture into parchment lined pan. Even it out using a spatula. Top with chopped nuts or seeds or a crumb at this point.\nBake for 50 to 55 minutes or until a toothpick from the center comes out almost clean.\nCool in the pan for 10 minutes, then remove from the pan and cool completely. Brush oil or melted vegan butter on top to keep the crust soft. Slice and serve warm with vegan butter. I usually refrigerate the loaf for 10-15 mins before slicing.", {"entities": [[31, 37, "INGREDIENT"], [56, 63, "QUANTITY"], [64, 82, "INGREDIENT"], [98, 105, "QUANTITY"], [139, 146, "QUANTITY"], [147, 152, "INGREDIENT"], [153, 158, "QUANTITY"], [159, 174, "INGREDIENT"], [184, 194, "INGREDIENT"], [195, 201, "QUANTITY"], [202, 205, "INGREDIENT"], [206, 213, "QUANTITY"], [214, 221, "INGREDIENT"], [223, 234, "INGREDIENT"], [245, 251, "QUANTITY"], [252, 263, "INGREDIENT"], [264, 271, "QUANTITY"], [272, 290, "INGREDIENT"], [329, 336, "QUANTITY"], [337, 349, "INGREDIENT"], [350, 357, "QUANTITY"], [358, 367, "INGREDIENT"], [406, 413, "QUANTITY"], [414, 430, "INGREDIENT"], [431, 438, "QUANTITY"], [439, 452, "INGREDIENT"], [453, 459, "QUANTITY"], [460, 474, "INGREDIENT"], [475, 480, "QUANTITY"], [481, 494, "INGREDIENT"], [495, 502, "QUANTITY"], [503, 507, "INGREDIENT"], [508, 515, "QUANTITY"], [516, 524, "INGREDIENT"], [574, 577, "PROCESS"], [635, 638, "PROCESS"], [654, 659, "INGREDIENT"], [722, 726, "INGREDIENT"], [894, 899, "PROCESS"], [1042, 1045, "PROCESS"], [1056, 1061, "INGREDIENT"], [1067, 1077, "INGREDIENT"], [1167, 1179, "INGREDIENT"], [1183, 1188, "INGREDIENT"], [1386, 1412, "INGREDIENT"], [1470, 1482, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
