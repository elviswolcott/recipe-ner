Take off the heat and let it cool for a minute, so that it thickens.\nDip the pressed and dry-blotted tofu slices into the curry sauce.

Repeat for all slices.\nHeat a grill pan over medium-high heat, once hot drizzle a grilling pan with a little bit of oil. Place the breaded tofu slices on the grill pan. Press each slice a little bit for a few seconds at a time. Cook for 3-5 minutes until grill marks are formed. Take off the grill pan and set aside. You can also pan fry these breaded tofu in a shallow pan/cast iron skillet.\nTo serve, fill the bowl with rice, pickled vegetables, some blanched veggies like bok choy or broccoli. Slice the breaded tofu slices diagonally and place on top of each of the bowls, drizzle with the remaining curry sauce liberally and serve. Add a dollop of asian Chile sauce in side for heat if needed.", {"entities": [[13, 18, "QUANTITY"], [19, 34, "INGREDIENT"], [37, 44, "PROCESS"], [98, 103, "QUANTITY"], [104, 132, "INGREDIENT"], [133, 138, "QUANTITY"], [139, 151, "INGREDIENT"], [161, 181, "INGREDIENT"], [202, 207, "QUANTITY"], [208, 218, "INGREDIENT"], [223, 229, "QUANTITY"], [230, 241, "INGREDIENT"], [243, 249, "QUANTITY"], [250, 262, "INGREDIENT"], [263, 270, "QUANTITY"], [271, 283, "INGREDIENT"], [284, 291, "QUANTITY"], [292, 296, "INGREDIENT"], [297, 304, "QUANTITY"], [305, 325, "INGREDIENT"], [326, 331, "QUANTITY"], [332, 341, "INGREDIENT"], [345, 351, "INGREDIENT"], [360, 367, "INGREDIENT"], [388, 393, "QUANTITY"], [394, 417, "INGREDIENT"], [418, 425, "QUANTITY"], [426, 439, "INGREDIENT"], [440, 445, "QUANTITY"], [446, 464, "INGREDIENT"], [477, 488, "INGREDIENT"], [553, 560, "QUANTITY"], [561, 565, "INGREDIENT"], [566, 573, "QUANTITY"], [574, 581, "INGREDIENT"], [601, 611, "INGREDIENT"], [621, 628, "INGREDIENT"], [651, 662, "INGREDIENT"], [664, 673, "INGREDIENT"], [701, 713, "INGREDIENT"], [748, 752, "INGREDIENT"], [832, 837, "PROCESS"], [842, 846, "INGREDIENT"], [904, 909, "INGREDIENT"], [929, 934, "PROCESS"], [971, 975, "PROCESS"], [977, 985, "PROCESS"], [1103, 1110, "PROCESS"], [1127, 1131, "INGREDIENT"], [1148, 1153, "INGREDIENT"], [1165, 1168, "INGREDIENT"], [1260, 1266, "PROCESS"], [1271, 1283, "INGREDIENT"], [1285, 1289, "INGREDIENT"], [1295, 1302, "INGREDIENT"], [1336, 1340, "INGREDIENT"], [1388, 1393, "INGREDIENT"], [1414, 1419, "PROCESS"], [1424, 1428, "INGREDIENT"], [1519, 1524, "PROCESS"], [1571, 1579, "PROCESS"], [1602, 1608, "INGREDIENT"], [1628, 1632, "INGREDIENT"], [1647, 1652, "PROCESS"], [1664, 1668, "INGREDIENT"], [1744, 1749, "PROCESS"], [1781, 1786, "PROCESS"], [1810, 1813, "INGREDIENT"], [1823, 1826, "PROCESS"], [1841, 1845, "INGREDIENT"], [1911, 1915, "INGREDIENT"], [1925, 1935, "INGREDIENT"], [1942, 1950, "PROCESS"], [1951, 1958, "INGREDIENT"], [1964, 1972, "INGREDIENT"], [1976, 1984, "INGREDIENT"], [2004, 2008, "INGREDIENT"], [2031, 2036, "PROCESS"], [2047, 2051, "INGREDIENT"], [2093, 2098, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
