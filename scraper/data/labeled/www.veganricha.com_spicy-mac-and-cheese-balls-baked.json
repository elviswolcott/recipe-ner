["Ingredients:\n1 recipe of my masala mac (or spicy mac)\n1 tbsp tomato paste\n3/4 cup breadcrumbs\n1/2 tsp salt\n3/4 to 1 tsp cayenne\n1/2 tsp paprika\n1/2 tsp garlic granules\n2 tsp italian herb blend\n\nInstructions:\nMake the mac and cheese. Mix in the tomato paste and let it chill overnight.\nTo Bake: Mix everything under breadcrumbs.\nRemove the mac from refrigerator. Dip a round bottom 1/4 cup or smaller round bowl type container in a bowl water to wet the cup. Pack 3 to 4 tablespoons worth mac in the container. sprinkle breadcrumb mixture on the open end of the cup and press to stick the breading as well as pack the mac well. Tap to release onto a baking sheet. Dip the cup in water again to rinse and wet and Repeat for the rest of the mac. Sprinkle breadcrumb mixture liberally on the mac balls and press. Spray oil on the balls.\nAlternatively, use your hands to make balls of the mac, place in breadcrumb mixture to coat and then place on baking sheet. You can freeze the balls for 10 minutes at this point. I usually dont because I can't wait :). Pre-heat the oven to 450 degrees F / 230c. Spray oil on the balls.\nBake for 15 to 17 minutes at 450 degrees F / 230c or until crisp to touch. Drizzle with sriracha and serve.", {"entities": [[54, 60, "QUANTITY"], [61, 73, "INGREDIENT"], [74, 81, "QUANTITY"], [82, 93, "INGREDIENT"], [94, 101, "QUANTITY"], [102, 106, "INGREDIENT"], [114, 119, "QUANTITY"], [120, 127, "INGREDIENT"], [128, 135, "QUANTITY"], [136, 143, "INGREDIENT"], [144, 151, "QUANTITY"], [152, 167, "INGREDIENT"], [168, 173, "QUANTITY"], [174, 192, "INGREDIENT"], [244, 256, "INGREDIENT"], [315, 326, "INGREDIENT"], [381, 388, "QUANTITY"], [436, 441, "INGREDIENT"], [453, 456, "QUANTITY"], [468, 481, "QUANTITY"], [510, 518, "PROCESS"], [561, 564, "QUANTITY"], [569, 574, "PROCESS"], [649, 655, "PROCESS"], [671, 674, "QUANTITY"], [678, 683, "INGREDIENT"], [802, 807, "PROCESS"], [815, 818, "INGREDIENT"], [889, 894, "PROCESS"], [934, 939, "PROCESS"], [943, 949, "PROCESS"], [961, 964, "INGREDIENT"], [1101, 1104, "INGREDIENT"], [1207, 1215, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
