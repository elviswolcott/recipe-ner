Blend the chimichurri sauce with a few tbsp of water and set aside. Line a baking dish with parchment. Preheat the oven to 425 deg F ( 220 C )\nRub oil and lemon juice all over the slices or florets.\nSprinkle the cajun spice + salt on both sides of the slices and rub lightly. Then sprinkle more on the open side. (If using florets, sprinkle spice + salt, then toss well to coat).&nbsp;For Crispyness, mix 2 tbsp breadcrumbs in the spice mix and salt and then sprinkle all over.\nSpray oil lightly on the spiced cauliflower to seal the spices in, Bake at 425 deg F for 20 to 25 mins. Broil for a minute to sear if needed.\nCauliflower tends to soften depending on the moisture content after cooking. So serve immediately. Sprinkle some more spice if needed. Cajun can be hot, so add another cooling dressing of choice if needed.Serve with a side salad of beans, chickpeas, or cooked grain or add to tacos, wraps. I make a salad bowl with cherry tomatoes/tomatoes, onion, chickpeas/beans, salt, pepper and chimichurri/lemon with these.", {"entities": [[30, 41, "INGREDIENT"], [82, 89, "INGREDIENT"], [107, 114, "INGREDIENT"], [116, 122, "QUANTITY"], [123, 140, "INGREDIENT"], [145, 160, "INGREDIENT"], [173, 185, "INGREDIENT"], [244, 251, "QUANTITY"], [253, 258, "QUANTITY"], [259, 262, "INGREDIENT"], [263, 268, "QUANTITY"], [269, 280, "INGREDIENT"], [291, 297, "INGREDIENT"], [322, 329, "INGREDIENT"], [355, 362, "INGREDIENT"], [383, 389, "INGREDIENT"], [398, 406, "INGREDIENT"], [467, 489, "INGREDIENT"], [516, 567, "INGREDIENT"], [580, 584, "INGREDIENT"], [597, 609, "INGREDIENT"], [621, 628, "INGREDIENT"], [687, 698, "INGREDIENT"], [712, 719, "INGREDIENT"], [765, 773, "INGREDIENT"], [796, 802, "PROCESS"], [868, 871, "INGREDIENT"], [876, 887, "INGREDIENT"], [911, 918, "INGREDIENT"], [933, 944, "INGREDIENT"], [947, 951, "INGREDIENT"], [1002, 1010, "PROCESS"], [1044, 1051, "INGREDIENT"], [1053, 1061, "PROCESS"], [1062, 1067, "INGREDIENT"], [1070, 1074, "INGREDIENT"], [1122, 1125, "PROCESS"], [1126, 1132, "QUANTITY"], [1133, 1144, "INGREDIENT"], [1152, 1157, "INGREDIENT"], [1158, 1161, "PROCESS"], [1166, 1170, "INGREDIENT"], [1180, 1188, "PROCESS"], [1205, 1208, "INGREDIENT"], [1231, 1242, "INGREDIENT"], [1325, 1329, "PROCESS"], [1409, 1416, "PROCESS"], [1459, 1464, "INGREDIENT"], [1482, 1485, "INGREDIENT"], [1497, 1500, "PROCESS"], [1580, 1589, "INGREDIENT"], [1594, 1600, "INGREDIENT"], [1610, 1613, "PROCESS"], [1656, 1671, "INGREDIENT"], [1672, 1680, "INGREDIENT"], [1682, 1687, "INGREDIENT"], [1689, 1698, "INGREDIENT"], [1706, 1710, "INGREDIENT"], [1712, 1718, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
