["Ingredients:\n1/3 cup pumpkin puree ( (pure pumpkin puree, not pumpkin pie filling. Use a well filled 1/3 cup))\n1/4 cup neutral oil\n1 tbsp flax seed meal\n1/2 tsp vanilla\n2 tbsp molasses\n1/2 cup sugar (( I usually use a mix of coconut and raw sugar))\n1.5 to 2 tsp ginger bread spice blend\n1 cup flour ((I use a mix of whole wheat and unbleached white), see notes for glutenfree)\n1/2 cup almond flour  (, see note for nutfree)\n3/4 tsp baking soda\n3/4 tsp baking powder\n1/4 tsp salt\n\nInstructions:\nIn a bowl mix all the wet ingredients until well combined. The sugar should mix in.\nIn another bowl add 3/4 cup of flour and rest of the dry ingredients and and mix well. Or use a sifter and add to that and sift everything into the wet bowl. Add rest of the flour 1 tbsp at a time to make a somewhat sticky dough. See Note *\nLet sit for 10 to 15 minutes on the counter if cool (its pretty cold these days) or chill in the refrigerator. The dough will become easier to handle.&nbsp;\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Flour or oil your hands. Make balls (about 1 inch balls) of the dough and lightly press on the baking sheet to flatten.\nBake at 350 degrees F for 11 to 13 minutes. For crispier, bake 1 to 2 mins longer. The cookies will be soft when just baked. Cookie slam the sheet for better crackling and texture. Let them cool for 5 minutes on the sheet, then transfer to a plate. Store on t he counter covered for the day and refrigerate for upto 5 days.&nbsp;", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 34, "INGREDIENT"], [43, 56, "INGREDIENT"], [62, 69, "INGREDIENT"], [101, 108, "QUANTITY"], [111, 118, "QUANTITY"], [119, 130, "INGREDIENT"], [131, 137, "QUANTITY"], [138, 152, "INGREDIENT"], [153, 160, "QUANTITY"], [161, 168, "INGREDIENT"], [169, 175, "QUANTITY"], [176, 184, "INGREDIENT"], [185, 192, "QUANTITY"], [193, 198, "INGREDIENT"], [218, 221, "PROCESS"], [225, 232, "INGREDIENT"], [237, 246, "INGREDIENT"], [256, 261, "QUANTITY"], [262, 286, "INGREDIENT"], [287, 292, "QUANTITY"], [293, 298, "INGREDIENT"], [309, 312, "PROCESS"], [316, 327, "INGREDIENT"], [377, 384, "QUANTITY"], [385, 397, "INGREDIENT"], [424, 431, "QUANTITY"], [432, 443, "INGREDIENT"], [444, 451, "QUANTITY"], [452, 465, "INGREDIENT"], [466, 473, "QUANTITY"], [474, 478, "INGREDIENT"], [504, 507, "PROCESS"], [557, 562, "INGREDIENT"], [570, 573, "PROCESS"], [594, 597, "PROCESS"], [598, 605, "QUANTITY"], [606, 614, "INGREDIENT"], [655, 658, "PROCESS"], [685, 688, "PROCESS"], [752, 757, "INGREDIENT"], [758, 764, "QUANTITY"], [1018, 1024, "PROCESS"], [1047, 1052, "INGREDIENT"], [1056, 1059, "INGREDIENT"], [1129, 1134, "PROCESS"], [1142, 1148, "PROCESS"], [1225, 1229, "PROCESS"], [1285, 1290, "PROCESS"]]}]
