["Ingredients:\n2 cups raw slivered almonds*\n2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice\n1/2 teaspoon garlic powder\n3/4 teaspoon salt\n1/2-3/4 cup water\n\nInstructions:\nTo a food processor (or high powered blender), add the almonds, lemon juice, garlic powder, salt and 1/4 cup of water. Blend until the nuts are broken down and fairly smooth, then add an additional 1/4 cup water and blend. Scrape down the sides as needed.\nAdd more water as needed until fluffy and fairly smooth. The texture will still be slightly grainy and nutty, not completely creamy and smooth. Feel free to add more herbs here, such as a teaspoon each of dried oregano and basil, or a handful of fresh basil.\nNow it&#039;s ready to be used anywhere you like, such as in Vegan Lasagna, Vegan Stuffed Shells or dolloped on pizza before baking. Enjoy!", {"entities": [[13, 19, "QUANTITY"], [20, 41, "INGREDIENT"], [42, 55, "QUANTITY"], [56, 73, "INGREDIENT"], [74, 86, "QUANTITY"], [87, 100, "INGREDIENT"], [101, 113, "QUANTITY"], [114, 118, "INGREDIENT"], [123, 130, "QUANTITY"], [131, 136, "INGREDIENT"], [199, 202, "PROCESS"], [207, 214, "INGREDIENT"], [216, 227, "INGREDIENT"], [229, 242, "INGREDIENT"], [244, 248, "INGREDIENT"], [253, 260, "QUANTITY"], [261, 269, "INGREDIENT"], [287, 291, "INGREDIENT"], [332, 335, "PROCESS"], [350, 357, "QUANTITY"], [358, 363, "INGREDIENT"], [417, 422, "INGREDIENT"], [565, 568, "PROCESS"], [574, 579, "INGREDIENT"], [605, 609, "INGREDIENT"], [613, 626, "INGREDIENT"], [631, 636, "INGREDIENT"], [654, 665, "INGREDIENT"], [792, 798, "PROCESS"]]}]
