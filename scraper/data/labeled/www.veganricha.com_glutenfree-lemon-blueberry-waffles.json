["Ingredients:\n1/2 cup almond flour\n1/2 cup oat flour\n1/4 cup potato starch\n1 teaspoon baking powder\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n3 tablespoons sugar\n1 tablespoon lemon juice\n1 tablespoon oil\n1 teaspoon lemon zest\n1/4 cup plus 1-2 tablespoons of club soda\n1/3 cup blueberries\n\nInstructions:\nIn a bowl, mix all the dry ingredients - oat flour, almond flour, potato starch, baking powder, salt, and sugar - and mix really well.\nThen add in the lemon juice, oil, lemon zest. Add in a 1/4 cup of the club soda and mix in. Add in more, 1 tablespoon at a time.\nLet the mixture sit for 2 minutes. It will start to thicken out and you can add more soda accordingly so that you have a pancake-like batter.\nDon't add any more club soda for 5 minutes because the batter does thicken a bit more because oat flour will thicken it up. But you don't want too much moisture.\nFold in the blueberries. Prepare your waffle iron by brushing a little bit of oil on it.\nOnce heated, add the batter and make your waffles.", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 33, "INGREDIENT"], [34, 41, "QUANTITY"], [42, 51, "INGREDIENT"], [52, 59, "QUANTITY"], [60, 73, "INGREDIENT"], [74, 84, "QUANTITY"], [85, 98, "INGREDIENT"], [99, 111, "QUANTITY"], [112, 116, "INGREDIENT"], [117, 130, "QUANTITY"], [131, 136, "INGREDIENT"], [137, 149, "QUANTITY"], [150, 161, "INGREDIENT"], [162, 174, "QUANTITY"], [175, 178, "INGREDIENT"], [179, 189, "QUANTITY"], [190, 200, "INGREDIENT"], [201, 208, "QUANTITY"], [209, 242, "INGREDIENT"], [243, 250, "QUANTITY"], [251, 262, "INGREDIENT"], [289, 292, "PROCESS"], [319, 328, "INGREDIENT"], [330, 342, "INGREDIENT"], [344, 357, "INGREDIENT"], [359, 372, "INGREDIENT"], [374, 378, "INGREDIENT"], [384, 389, "INGREDIENT"], [396, 399, "PROCESS"], [418, 421, "PROCESS"], [429, 440, "INGREDIENT"], [442, 445, "INGREDIENT"], [447, 457, "INGREDIENT"], [468, 475, "QUANTITY"], [483, 492, "INGREDIENT"], [497, 500, "PROCESS"], [518, 530, "QUANTITY"], [614, 617, "INGREDIENT"], [618, 621, "PROCESS"], [690, 693, "PROCESS"], [703, 712, "INGREDIENT"], [778, 787, "INGREDIENT"], [858, 869, "INGREDIENT"], [921, 927, "INGREDIENT"], [948, 951, "PROCESS"]]}]
