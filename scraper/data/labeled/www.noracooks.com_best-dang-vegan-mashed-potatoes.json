["Ingredients:\n4 pounds russet potatoes\n3 cloves garlic, chopped\n4-5 tablespoons vegan butter\n1 cup unsweetened, unflavored soy, cashew or almond milk\nsalt + black pepper, to taste\n\nInstructions:\nFirst, peel your potatoes and chop them into large chunks. Place the potatoes in a large pot along with the chopped garlic, and cover with cold water.\nBring to a boil and cook uncovered for about 15 minutes or until fork tender. How long they take will depend on how small you cut them.\u00c2\u00a0\nDrain the potatoes (and garlic) in a colander, letting them sit for about 5 minutes.\nHeat your plant milk until just warm, not boiling, either in the microwave or stovetop. This will help keep your potatoes warm and it will absorb better. Set aside.\nReturn the drained potatoes to the pot, add the vegan butter and begin mashing by hand. Pour in a little milk at a time while mashing until they are smooth and creamy. Season with salt and pepper to taste and serve immediately. Enjoy!\nMake ahead option: You can make the potatoes a day or two in advance if needed. Follow the recipe, then cool, cover and refrigerate. When ready to serve, warm in an oven safe dish for 30 minutes or so (350 degrees F) until warm. You could also warm them in a crock pot on low for 3-4 hours.", {"entities": [[22, 37, "INGREDIENT"], [40, 46, "INGREDIENT"], [47, 53, "INGREDIENT"], [55, 62, "INGREDIENT"], [65, 78, "QUANTITY"], [79, 91, "INGREDIENT"], [92, 97, "QUANTITY"], [98, 148, "INGREDIENT"], [149, 153, "INGREDIENT"], [156, 168, "INGREDIENT"], [211, 219, "INGREDIENT"], [263, 271, "INGREDIENT"], [302, 316, "INGREDIENT"], [333, 343, "INGREDIENT"], [356, 360, "PROCESS"], [365, 369, "PROCESS"], [493, 501, "INGREDIENT"], [507, 513, "INGREDIENT"], [578, 588, "INGREDIENT"], [610, 617, "PROCESS"], [681, 689, "INGREDIENT"], [752, 760, "INGREDIENT"], [773, 776, "PROCESS"], [781, 793, "INGREDIENT"], [838, 842, "INGREDIENT"], [913, 917, "INGREDIENT"], [922, 928, "INGREDIENT"], [991, 994, "INGREDIENT"], [1004, 1012, "INGREDIENT"], [1163, 1168, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
