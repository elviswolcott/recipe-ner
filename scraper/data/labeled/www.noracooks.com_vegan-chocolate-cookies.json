["Ingredients:\n1/2 cup vegan butter, melted\n1 cup granulated sugar\n1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n1 tablespoon ground flaxseeds\n1/4 cup soy milk\n1 1/2 cups all purpose flour\n1/2 cup dutch-processed cocoa powder\n1 teaspoon baking soda\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n1 cup vegan chocolate chips\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nMelt the vegan butter, then add to a large bowl with the sugar and mix well with a large spoon. Now stir in the vanilla, flaxseeds and soy milk until well combined.\nOver the bowl with the wet ingredients, sift in the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt. Stir to combine. The dough will be quite thick, so you can use your hands if needed. Now fold in the chocolate chips, leaving some to place on top of the cookies for decoration if you want. Again, you may need to use your hands to really get the chocolate chips incorporated.\nScoop about 2 tablespoons of the dough at a time, roll into a ball, then flatten a bit on the baking sheet. They will spread out more as they bake. Decorate with a few more chocolate chips on top, if desired.\nBake for about 10 minutes. They will seem too soft, but will firm up as they cool. Let them cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely.", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 41, "INGREDIENT"], [42, 47, "QUANTITY"], [48, 64, "INGREDIENT"], [65, 75, "QUANTITY"], [76, 96, "INGREDIENT"], [97, 109, "QUANTITY"], [110, 126, "INGREDIENT"], [127, 134, "QUANTITY"], [135, 143, "INGREDIENT"], [144, 154, "QUANTITY"], [155, 172, "INGREDIENT"], [173, 180, "QUANTITY"], [181, 209, "INGREDIENT"], [210, 220, "QUANTITY"], [221, 232, "INGREDIENT"], [233, 245, "QUANTITY"], [246, 250, "INGREDIENT"], [251, 256, "QUANTITY"], [257, 278, "INGREDIENT"], [339, 345, "PROCESS"], [383, 395, "INGREDIENT"], [402, 405, "PROCESS"], [431, 436, "INGREDIENT"], [441, 444, "PROCESS"], [474, 478, "PROCESS"], [486, 493, "INGREDIENT"], [495, 504, "INGREDIENT"], [509, 517, "INGREDIENT"], [591, 596, "INGREDIENT"], [598, 610, "INGREDIENT"], [612, 623, "INGREDIENT"], [628, 633, "INGREDIENT"], [689, 692, "INGREDIENT"], [735, 750, "INGREDIENT"], [768, 773, "PROCESS"], [880, 895, "INGREDIENT"], [922, 935, "QUANTITY"], [1004, 1010, "PROCESS"], [1052, 1056, "PROCESS"], [1083, 1098, "INGREDIENT"], [1223, 1229, "PROCESS"]]}]
