["Ingredients:\n1/4 cup wheat berries  (or other grains like spelt, or rye)\n1/4 cup millet\n3/4 cup water\n2.25 cups bread flour  (or unbleached flour)\n1.25 cups whole wheat flour\n1.5 tsp salt\n1/2 cup water\n1 Tbsp active yeast\n1 Tbsp sugar\n1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil\n1/4 cup non dairy yogurt  (or coconut milk)\n\nInstructions:\nSprout the grains: Soak the wheat berries and millet in water overnight. Drain, wash and let sit in the bowl covered with a damp paper towel and a lid. Depending on the ambient temperature, it might take a day or more to sprout.\nBlend the sprouted grains with 3/4 cup water 2 to 3 cycles so the grains break down and are not too large to inhibit gluten formation. (each blending cycle is a minute long)\nMix the salt into the bread + wheat flours and keep ready.\nMix the yeast and sugar in a 1/2 cup of warm water and let sit for 5 minutes or until frothy.\nIn a stand mixer or by hand, add the flours, yeast mixture, blended sprouted grains, warmed yogurt and oil and knead into a soft dough. Let sit for 1.5 hours. Punch down, use a Tbsp or so flour to shape into a loaf. Spray water on the loaf and sprinkle sesame seeds or oats. Cover with a towel and let rise until doubled. 40-45 mins.\nBake for 40-45 minutes at pre-heated 365 degrees F / 180c. Cool completely before slicing. Store refrigerated for upto a week.
