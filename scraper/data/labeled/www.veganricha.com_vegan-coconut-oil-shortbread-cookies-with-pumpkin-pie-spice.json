["Ingredients:\n1/2 cup powdered sugar\n1/4 cup coconut oil (I used refined, semi solid, warm if too solid before using)\n2.5 tbsp non dairy yogurt\n1/2 to 1 tsp vanilla extract\n1/2 to 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice (or 1/2 tsp cinnamon,1/4 tsp ginger, and generous pinch of ground nutmeg and cloves)\n1/8 tsp salt\na generous pinch of baking soda\n1/2 cup Spelt flour or whole wheat pastry flour\n1 cup white unbleached flour\n1/4 cup candied papaya (dried cranberries, chopped dried apricots, candied ginger or other dried fruit of choice.)\n\nInstructions:\nIn a bowl cream the coconut oil, sugar and non dairy yogurt until smooth and creamy. Add in the vanilla and spices if using. Mix well.\nMix the baking soda and salt into 1/2 cup spelt flour and add to the bowl. Mix in.\nAdd the rest of the flour 1/2 cup at a time and combine well into a soft dough. If too dry, add a spray of water and mix in. If too sticky, add a tbsp or so more flour. Add the dried or candied fruit of choice. Mix into the dough.\nShape the dough into a 1 to 1.5 inch width log. Fold a parchment sheet over the log and freeze for 30 minutes.\nPreheat the oven to 325 degrees F / 160c. Remove the log from the freezer. Slice into 1/4 inch thick slices and place on parchment lined sheet.\nBake for 19 to 20 minutes or till the edges just start to change color. Cool completely and store.\nIf your oven runs hot, bake for less time. The cookies get crunchy when over baked.\nOr bake as one shortbread pastry by pressing into brownie pan. Bake at 315 degrees F / 160c 30 minutes or longer.", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 35, "INGREDIENT"], [36, 43, "QUANTITY"], [44, 55, "INGREDIENT"], [126, 142, "INGREDIENT"], [150, 155, "QUANTITY"], [156, 171, "INGREDIENT"], [179, 184, "QUANTITY"], [185, 202, "INGREDIENT"], [207, 214, "QUANTITY"], [232, 238, "INGREDIENT"], [262, 275, "INGREDIENT"], [280, 286, "INGREDIENT"], [288, 295, "QUANTITY"], [296, 300, "INGREDIENT"], [318, 332, "INGREDIENT"], [333, 340, "QUANTITY"], [341, 380, "INGREDIENT"], [381, 386, "QUANTITY"], [387, 409, "INGREDIENT"], [410, 417, "QUANTITY"], [418, 432, "INGREDIENT"], [434, 451, "INGREDIENT"], [453, 460, "INGREDIENT"], [477, 491, "INGREDIENT"], [560, 571, "INGREDIENT"], [573, 578, "INGREDIENT"], [583, 599, "INGREDIENT"], [636, 643, "INGREDIENT"], [683, 694, "INGREDIENT"], [699, 703, "INGREDIENT"], [709, 716, "QUANTITY"], [717, 728, "INGREDIENT"], [733, 736, "PROCESS"], [778, 783, "INGREDIENT"], [784, 791, "QUANTITY"], [850, 853, "PROCESS"], [862, 870, "INGREDIENT"], [875, 878, "PROCESS"], [898, 901, "PROCESS"], [909, 914, "INGREDIENT"], [920, 925, "INGREDIENT"], [1212, 1217, "PROCESS"], [1366, 1370, "PROCESS"], [1420, 1425, "PROCESS"], [1430, 1434, "PROCESS"], [1463, 1471, "PROCESS"]]}]
