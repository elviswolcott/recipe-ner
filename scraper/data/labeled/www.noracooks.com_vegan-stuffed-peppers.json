["Ingredients:\n6 medium/large bell peppers, any color\n1 cup dry TVP (textured vegetable protein) (*See notes for substitutions )\n2 cups water\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n1/2 medium onion, diced small\n3 cloves garlic, minced\n2 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce (*use tamari for gluten free)\n1 teaspoon dried oregano\n1 teaspoon dried basil\n1 1/2 cups cooked white or brown rice\n15 ounce can tomato sauce\nsalt + pepper, to taste\n1 1/2 cups shredded vegan mozzarella (*homemade or store bought, may leave out)\nchopped fresh parsley, optional\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F and lightly spray a 9x13 inch casserole dish with oil.\nPrep the peppers: Slice off the tops of the bell peppers and remove the seeds and ribs that are inside.\nPre-cook the peppers: Place the peppers in the casserole dish cut side down. Pour 1 1/2 cups water into the dish around the peppers. Cover with foil and place in the oven for 25 minutes. This will soften the peppers somewhat, making them more tender.\nWhile the peppers are pre-cooking, make the filling: In a large skillet, add the dry TVP and 2 cups of water. Bring to a boil on high heat and cook for 5-10 minutes, until all the water is absorbed.\nNow add the olive oil, diced onion, garlic, soy sauce, oregano and basil to the skillet and cook for 5-10 minutes over medium heat. Stir in the cooked rice and tomato sauce, and add salt + pepper to taste. Stir in 1/2 cup of the vegan cheese, if using. Remove the filling from heat and set aside.\nRemove the peppers from the oven and drain off the excess water, carefully. When the peppers are cool enough to handle, flip them over in the casserole dish and fill each one with the filling.\nSprinkle the rest of the vegan cheese on each pepper evenly and bake for about 30 minutes. Sprinkle with chopped parsley if desired and serve immediately.", {"entities": [[28, 40, "INGREDIENT"], [52, 57, "QUANTITY"], [58, 65, "INGREDIENT"], [67, 93, "INGREDIENT"], [127, 133, "QUANTITY"], [134, 139, "INGREDIENT"], [140, 153, "QUANTITY"], [154, 163, "INGREDIENT"], [175, 180, "INGREDIENT"], [182, 187, "INGREDIENT"], [196, 202, "INGREDIENT"], [203, 209, "INGREDIENT"], [211, 217, "INGREDIENT"], [218, 231, "QUANTITY"], [232, 252, "INGREDIENT"], [259, 265, "INGREDIENT"], [283, 293, "QUANTITY"], [294, 307, "INGREDIENT"], [308, 318, "QUANTITY"], [319, 330, "INGREDIENT"], [331, 341, "QUANTITY"], [342, 368, "INGREDIENT"], [369, 377, "QUANTITY"], [378, 394, "INGREDIENT"], [395, 399, "INGREDIENT"], [402, 408, "INGREDIENT"], [419, 429, "QUANTITY"], [430, 455, "INGREDIENT"], [470, 482, "INGREDIENT"], [499, 530, "INGREDIENT"], [630, 633, "INGREDIENT"], [679, 691, "INGREDIENT"], [707, 712, "INGREDIENT"], [743, 747, "PROCESS"], [821, 831, "QUANTITY"], [832, 837, "INGREDIENT"], [892, 897, "PROCESS"], [1016, 1023, "PROCESS"], [1063, 1066, "PROCESS"], [1071, 1078, "INGREDIENT"], [1083, 1089, "QUANTITY"], [1090, 1098, "INGREDIENT"], [1111, 1115, "PROCESS"], [1133, 1137, "PROCESS"], [1170, 1175, "INGREDIENT"], [1193, 1196, "PROCESS"], [1201, 1210, "INGREDIENT"], [1212, 1223, "INGREDIENT"], [1225, 1231, "INGREDIENT"], [1233, 1243, "INGREDIENT"], [1244, 1251, "INGREDIENT"], [1256, 1261, "INGREDIENT"], [1281, 1285, "PROCESS"], [1333, 1344, "INGREDIENT"], [1349, 1362, "INGREDIENT"], [1367, 1370, "PROCESS"], [1371, 1375, "INGREDIENT"], [1378, 1384, "INGREDIENT"], [1403, 1410, "QUANTITY"], [1418, 1430, "INGREDIENT"], [1544, 1549, "INGREDIENT"], [1652, 1656, "INGREDIENT"], [1704, 1716, "INGREDIENT"], [1720, 1724, "INGREDIENT"], [1725, 1731, "INGREDIENT"], [1743, 1747, "PROCESS"], [1784, 1799, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
