Lightly grease a baking sheet with olive oil. Cut the sweet potato in half lengthwise and place facedown on the pan. Bake for about 30 minutes, until fork tender and cooked through. Remove from oven. Lower the oven to 375 degrees.\nWhen the sweet potatoes are cool enough to handle, peel off the skin and add the flesh to a large bowl. Mash with a potato masher, add the black beans and slightly mash the beans into the sweet potatoes, leaving some beans whole.\nTo the bowl with the sweet potatoes and black beans, add the diced red onion, oats, cumin, smoked paprika, onion powder, garlic powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt.

You can use the same pan you cooked the sweet potato on.\nFill a 1/2 cup measuring cup, then form into a burger shape, about 1 inch thick. You can make them thinner or thicker as you prefer. Place burgers on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 15 minutes, flip carefully and bake for 15 more minutes.
