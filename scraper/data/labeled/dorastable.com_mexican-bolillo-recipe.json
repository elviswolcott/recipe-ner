["Ingredients:\n1 pack Active dry yeast ((7 g))\n3 1/3 cups All-purpose flour ((480 g))\n1 tsp. Sugar ((4 g))\n1 tsp. Salt ((7 g))\n1 cup + 1/3 Hot Water ((225 ml))\n\nInstructions:\nIn a small bowl,  combine yeast with 1/3 cup warm water, and 2 tbsp of flour. Whisk to combine and let sit for 20 min.\nIn the meantime, combine the flour, sugar, and salt in a mixer bowl and mix on low with the dough hook until combined. Add yeast mixture and continue to mix on low.\nAdd remaining cup of hot water slowly ( the hottest water that comes out of your faucet), and increase speed to medium-low. Continue mixing for 15 minutes or until the dough comes together and is stretchy, but not overly sticky.\nPlace dough in a well-oiled bowl and cover with a towel. Let rest in a warm place for 30 min. to an hour or until it doubles in size. (This will depend on how hot it is where you live.)\nPlace dough on a lightly floured surface and cut into 6 equal pieces.\nTake each piece and roll with your hands to form an oval shape. Pinch edges to make the characteristic pointy ends of the bolillo.\nPlace on a parchment lined sheet tray ( a perforated sheet tray or baguette pan would be even better). Cover with a towel and let rise for 1 hour or until doubled in size.\nPreheat oven to 450F at least 20 minutes before baking. Place a metal cake pan or pie pan on the bottom rack of the oven.\nOnce the bolillos have doubled in size, and right before placing them in the oven, make a  inch deep cut using a razor blade or sharp serrated knife at a 45 angle.\nSpray bolillos with warm water and place in the oven. Add 1  cups of water to pie pan in oven.\nBake 20 - 25 min. or until the bolillos are golden brown and they sound hollow when you tap on them.\nRemove from oven and let them cool on a wire rack.", {"entities": [[20, 36, "INGREDIENT"], [39, 42, "QUANTITY"], [45, 55, "QUANTITY"], [56, 73, "INGREDIENT"], [76, 81, "QUANTITY"], [84, 89, "QUANTITY"], [91, 96, "INGREDIENT"], [99, 102, "QUANTITY"], [105, 110, "QUANTITY"], [112, 116, "INGREDIENT"], [119, 122, "QUANTITY"], [125, 130, "QUANTITY"], [131, 146, "INGREDIENT"], [149, 155, "QUANTITY"], [199, 204, "INGREDIENT"], [214, 228, "INGREDIENT"], [234, 240, "QUANTITY"], [241, 249, "INGREDIENT"], [321, 326, "INGREDIENT"], [328, 333, "INGREDIENT"], [339, 343, "INGREDIENT"], [364, 367, "PROCESS"], [415, 420, "INGREDIENT"], [445, 448, "PROCESS"], [471, 474, "QUANTITY"], [478, 487, "INGREDIENT"], [509, 514, "INGREDIENT"], [590, 596, "PROCESS"], [762, 767, "PROCESS"], [947, 951, "INGREDIENT"], [1293, 1299, "PROCESS"], [1551, 1561, "INGREDIENT"], [1566, 1571, "PROCESS"], [1589, 1596, "QUANTITY"], [1597, 1605, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
