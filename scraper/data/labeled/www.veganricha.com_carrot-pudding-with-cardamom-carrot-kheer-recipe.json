["Ingredients:\n1 tbsp vegan butter or oil\n2 cups (packed) shredded carrots\n2 to 2.5 cups thin cashew milk or 2.5 cups almond milk blended with 1/4 cup raw cashews\n1/8 to 1/4 tsp salt (use 1/8 tsp if using vegan butters)\n1 to 3 tbsp coconut sugar or other sugar or sweetener\n1/4 tsp ground cardamom\na pinch of cinnamon\n3 tbsp chopped nuts like cashews (almonds, walnuts (raw or roasted))\n3 tbsp currants or chopped dried fruit like dates (raisins, figs)\nchia seeds (pepitas, coconut, currants for garnish.)\n\nInstructions:\nHeat vegan butter/ oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add carrots and cook for 5 to 6 minutes, sitrring occasionally.\nAdd the non dairy milk and mix. Cook for 10 minutes.\nReduce heat to medium low. Add salt, sugar, cardamom, cinnamon and mix in. Add the nuts and dried fruit and mix in. Carrots get sweeter on cooking, so you might need little to no sugar. Add less to begin with. Continue to cook partially covered for 5 to 15 minutes depending on your preferred consistency. The pudding thickens on cooling.\nServe warm or cold garnished with chia seeds, pepitas, dried fruits. I like it best a day later when the carrots have absorbed the flavors, spices and milk to soften further.", {"entities": [[13, 19, "QUANTITY"], [20, 39, "INGREDIENT"], [40, 46, "QUANTITY"], [48, 54, "INGREDIENT"], [56, 72, "INGREDIENT"], [87, 160, "INGREDIENT"], [165, 180, "INGREDIENT"], [186, 193, "QUANTITY"], [223, 229, "QUANTITY"], [230, 271, "INGREDIENT"], [272, 279, "QUANTITY"], [280, 295, "INGREDIENT"], [304, 315, "INGREDIENT"], [316, 322, "QUANTITY"], [323, 348, "INGREDIENT"], [350, 357, "INGREDIENT"], [359, 366, "INGREDIENT"], [375, 382, "PROCESS"], [385, 391, "QUANTITY"], [392, 434, "INGREDIENT"], [436, 443, "INGREDIENT"], [445, 449, "INGREDIENT"], [451, 461, "INGREDIENT"], [463, 470, "INGREDIENT"], [472, 480, "INGREDIENT"], [481, 489, "INGREDIENT"], [538, 541, "INGREDIENT"], [577, 584, "INGREDIENT"], [589, 593, "PROCESS"], [645, 659, "INGREDIENT"], [664, 667, "PROCESS"], [721, 725, "INGREDIENT"], [727, 732, "INGREDIENT"], [734, 742, "INGREDIENT"], [744, 752, "INGREDIENT"], [757, 760, "PROCESS"], [773, 777, "INGREDIENT"], [798, 801, "PROCESS"], [806, 813, "INGREDIENT"], [829, 836, "PROCESS"], [869, 874, "INGREDIENT"], [912, 916, "PROCESS"], [1063, 1073, "INGREDIENT"], [1075, 1082, "INGREDIENT"], [1134, 1141, "INGREDIENT"], [1180, 1184, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
