["Ingredients:\n1 cup (8 oz) Primal Kitchen Avocado oil\n4 cups (1 lb. 2 oz.)  Masa harina\n1  tsp. Baking powder\n1 tbsp. Salt\n4 cups Vegetable stock or broth, (warm)\n10 oz Vegan cheese ((I used Field Roast Chao Slices))\n1 can (12 oz.) Sliced pickled jalape\u00c3\u00b1o peppers\n30  Corn Husks\n\nInstructions:\nSoak the corn husks in hot water, in a large pot or in your kitchen sink. Place a plate over them to weigh them down so they are completely submerged. Let them soak for at least an hour.\nTo make the filling, cut the cheese into 1 inch strips, and get your jalape\u00c3\u00b1os ready.\nTo make the dough, beat the avocado oil, on medium-high speed, with an electric mixer, about 3 minutes. Add the baking powder, salt, and beat for 1 minute to incorporate into the oil.\nAdd half of the masa harina then add half of the vegetable stock. After it is completely incorporated, add the other half of masa harina and vegetable stock. Beat at low speed, until thoroughly mixed. It should have the consistency of a thick cake batter. If necessary add more vegetable stock until you reach that consistency. Taste the dough, and add more salt if necessary. It should be a little bit salty.\nFor lighter and fluffier tamales, let the dough rest for an hour in the refrigerator. Remove the dough from the fridge and rebeat it, adding enough liquid to get it to the consistency it had before.\nRemove the corn husks from the water and set on paper towels. Reserve the largest husks to wrap the tamales and the small ones to line the steamer.\nTo set up your steamer, fill the bottom with water making sure the water is not touching the steamer rack. Line the rack and sides of the steamer pot with corn husks. Set aside.\nPull 24 pencil thin strips off of the corn husks and set aside. Take a husk and dry off the excess water with a paper towel. Place the husk in your hand with the tapered side away from you and the smooth side up. Using a spoon, spread 2-3 tbsp. of the dough ( inch thick) onto the corn husk, forming a 3 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 4 inch square. Leave a border of at least 3/4 inch on each side of the square.\nPlace two strips of the cheese and one jalape\u00c3\u00b1o slice. Bring the two long sides of the corn husk together, this will cause the masa to surround the filling, and roll them in the same direction around the tamal. (If the husk is too small, fold one of the long sides towards the center, and then fold the other long side on top.) Fold down the empty tapered section of the corn husk, forming a closed bottom. This will leave the top of the tamal open. Tie with a corn husk strip to secure the bottom of the tamal.\nPlace the tamal in the steamer vertically leaning against the side of the pot, with the folded part of the tamal on the bottom. Repeat this process until you run out of dough and all the tamales are in the steamer. Cover them with a layer of corn husks. If the steamer is not full, fill the empty spaces with more corn husks. Cover the pot and bring the water to a boil. Turn heat down to medium and cook for 40 minutes. Check the tamales, when they separate easily from the corn husk it means they are done. If they are not done, steam for 10 more minutes and check again.\nRemove steamer from the heat and let sit covered for 10 minutes. Uncover and let cool for at least an hour. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be alarmed if the tamales seem really soft. As they cool, they will firm up.", {"entities": [[13, 18, "QUANTITY"], [20, 24, "QUANTITY"], [49, 52, "INGREDIENT"], [53, 59, "QUANTITY"], [67, 71, "QUANTITY"], [75, 86, "INGREDIENT"], [87, 93, "QUANTITY"], [95, 108, "INGREDIENT"], [109, 115, "QUANTITY"], [117, 121, "INGREDIENT"], [122, 128, "QUANTITY"], [129, 154, "INGREDIENT"], [162, 167, "QUANTITY"], [168, 180, "INGREDIENT"], [218, 221, "INGREDIENT"], [223, 228, "QUANTITY"], [231, 237, "INGREDIENT"], [268, 272, "INGREDIENT"], [303, 307, "INGREDIENT"], [317, 326, "INGREDIENT"], [596, 607, "INGREDIENT"], [680, 693, "INGREDIENT"], [695, 699, "INGREDIENT"], [747, 750, "INGREDIENT"], [785, 788, "PROCESS"], [811, 816, "INGREDIENT"], [855, 858, "PROCESS"], [903, 908, "INGREDIENT"], [946, 951, "PROCESS"], [1021, 1024, "PROCESS"], [1040, 1045, "INGREDIENT"], [1101, 1104, "PROCESS"], [1110, 1114, "INGREDIENT"], [1296, 1302, "PROCESS"], [1372, 1376, "INGREDIENT"], [1392, 1397, "INGREDIENT"], [1452, 1456, "PROCESS"], [1554, 1559, "INGREDIENT"], [1576, 1581, "INGREDIENT"], [1664, 1668, "INGREDIENT"], [1702, 1706, "PROCESS"], [1725, 1729, "INGREDIENT"], [1786, 1791, "INGREDIENT"], [1924, 1930, "QUANTITY"], [1968, 1972, "INGREDIENT"], [2049, 2053, "INGREDIENT"], [2162, 2166, "INGREDIENT"], [2446, 2450, "INGREDIENT"], [2536, 2540, "INGREDIENT"], [2829, 2833, "INGREDIENT"], [2901, 2905, "INGREDIENT"], [2941, 2946, "INGREDIENT"], [2952, 2956, "PROCESS"], [2987, 2991, "PROCESS"], [3062, 3066, "INGREDIENT"], [3118, 3123, "PROCESS"]]}]
