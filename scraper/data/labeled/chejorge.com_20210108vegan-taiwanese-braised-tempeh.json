["Ingredients:\n1 block (230 g) tempeh\n4  dried shiitake mushrooms\n1.5 cups hot water (for soaking mushrooms)\n2 teaspoons doubanjiang (spicy bean paste)\n3 cloves garlic, minced\n1 teaspoon fresh ginger, minced\n1  shallot, finely minced\n2  dried chilis, deseeded & minced\n1  whole star-anise (optional)\n1  bay leaf (optional)\n4 tablespoons light soy sauce\n2 tablespoons dark soy sauce\n2 tablespoons shaoxing wine (or mirin)\n2 tablespoons dark brown sugar\n\nInstructions:\nPrepare the Tempeh. First, crumble up the tempeh with your hands into a \"minced pork\" texture (if your tempeh is frozen, let it thaw completely first). Boil a pot of water and blanch the tempeh for about 10 minutes to rid its bitter aftertaste. When 10 minutes is up, strain out the tempeh from the water and let cool. Set aside.\nPrepare the Shiitake Mushrooms. Soak shiitake mushrooms in hot water for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, take out the mushrooms and mince them finely. Reserve the mushroom soaking liquid as well.\nBraise the Tempeh. In a pot or wok, heat up 1-2 tablespoons of vegetable oil (or other neutral oil) on medium heat. Add the doubanjiang and fry until fragrant (the oil should turn orange), about 1 minute. Follow with the garlic, ginger, dried chilis, and shallots. Fry while constantly stirring for 2-3 minutes, then add back the minced tempeh and minced mushrooms, along with the star-anise and bay leaf (if adding). Cook to lightly brown the tempeh, about 3-4 minutes. Deglaze the pot with soy sauce, mushroom-soaking water, Shaoxing wine, and dark brown sugar (I like to pre-combine them). Cover and braise for 15-20 minutes. Near the end of the braising, remove the lid and reduce the braising liquid to concentrate the flavors. Adjust seasoning with salt at the end.\nAssemble. Serve over white rice with fresh scallions and pickled radishes (or other pickled vegetables).
