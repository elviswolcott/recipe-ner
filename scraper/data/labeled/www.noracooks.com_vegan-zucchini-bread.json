Whisk well until combined.\nLightly blot the grated zucchini with paper towels, and add it to the bowl. Stir the zucchini into the wet ingredients.\nNow add the flour to the wet ingredients. Sprinkle the baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon on top of the flour. Stir gently until just combined, being careful not to over mix, or your loaf will be dense.\nFold in the walnuts or chocolate chips, if using. Pour into the prepared pan, and bake for 45-55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.\nLet it cool in the pan for a few minutes, then transfer the loaf to parchment paper or a cooling rack.
