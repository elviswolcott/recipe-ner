["Ingredients:\n4  Bolillos or French rolls\n1 can (15.5 oz.) Black beans\n2  Avocadoes\n1  Onion (white, sliced thinly)\n2  Tomatoes (large, sliced)\n - 1 lb. Homemade vegan chorizo (see note)\n\nInstructions:\nHeat a large saut\u00c3\u00a9 pan to medium heat. Add 1 tbsp. of oil or water (if you are oil-free). Add chorizo and cook for 5-6 minutes or until it begins to slightly brown. Remove from heat and set aside.\nCut the avocadoes in half, remove the pits, and scoop out the flesh with a spoon into a bowl. Mash with a fork and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.\nDrain the black beans, but reserve 2-3 tbsp. of the liquid. Mash the beans with a fork or a potato masher until they reach the consistency of refried beans. (You can, of course, use real refried beans instead.) I like to add 2 tbsp. of salsa instead of the canned bean liquid.\nSlice the rolls in half, lengthwise and scoop out some of the soft interior. Spread 2 tbsp. or more of the avocado on the top half of the bread, and top with 2 slices of onion.\nSpread 2 tbsp. or more of the beans on the bottom half of the bread. Divide the chorizo mixture between the bottom half of the 4 rolls. Top with 2-3 slices of tomato, and cover with top half of bread.\nHeat a griddle or cast iron pan over medium heat. Once hot, place the tortas on it and cook for about 5 min, on each side. You can place a heavy saut\u00c3\u00a9 pan on top of the tortas while they are cooking to give it a panini effect, or just use a panini press.\nServe with pickled jalape\u00c3\u00b1os.", {"entities": [[43, 46, "INGREDIENT"], [58, 69, "INGREDIENT"], [86, 91, "INGREDIENT"], [245, 251, "QUANTITY"], [253, 259, "INGREDIENT"], [263, 268, "INGREDIENT"], [281, 284, "INGREDIENT"], [308, 312, "PROCESS"], [526, 530, "INGREDIENT"], [535, 541, "INGREDIENT"], [564, 575, "INGREDIENT"], [591, 597, "QUANTITY"], [646, 652, "INGREDIENT"], [716, 719, "INGREDIENT"], [775, 778, "PROCESS"], [779, 785, "QUANTITY"], [790, 795, "INGREDIENT"], [811, 817, "INGREDIENT"], [915, 921, "QUANTITY"], [923, 930, "INGREDIENT"], [998, 1006, "INGREDIENT"], [1015, 1021, "QUANTITY"], [1023, 1030, "INGREDIENT"], [1167, 1173, "INGREDIENT"], [1269, 1274, "PROCESS"], [1296, 1300, "PROCESS"], [1321, 1325, "INGREDIENT"], [1336, 1339, "INGREDIENT"], [1340, 1345, "PROCESS"], [1401, 1408, "PROCESS"], [1458, 1463, "PROCESS"]]}]
