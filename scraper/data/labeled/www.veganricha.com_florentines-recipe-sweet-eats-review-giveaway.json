["Ingredients:\n11/4 cups sliced almonds\n1/4 cup superfine brown rice flour (I used white rice flour)\n1/3 cup sugar\n4 tablespoons nondairy margarine\n1/4 cup agave\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n1/3 cup nondairy chocolate (melted)\n2 tablespoons finely chopped Candied Orange Peels or orange zest\n\nInstructions:\n Preheat oven to 350F / 1780c.\n In a medium bowl, combine the almonds and the brown rice flour. In a small saucepan, mix together the sugar, margarine, agave, and salt and bring to a boil, stirring often. Remove immediately from heat and stir mixture into the almond mixture. Mix until totally combined and drop by heaping table- spoons onto a parchment-lined cookie sheet, about 3 inches apart. Using a lightly greased fork, press down cookies into a flat circle, so that the almonds are in a single layer.\n Bake 5 minutes, rotate the cookie sheet and bake 4 to 5 minutes more, until the edges of the cookies are golden brown. Let cool completely and then drizzle with melted chocolate and sprinkle with orange peel. Let chocolate firm up before serving. Store in airtight container up to 1 week.", {"entities": [[13, 22, "QUANTITY"], [23, 37, "INGREDIENT"], [38, 45, "QUANTITY"], [46, 72, "INGREDIENT"], [81, 97, "INGREDIENT"], [99, 106, "QUANTITY"], [107, 112, "INGREDIENT"], [113, 126, "QUANTITY"], [127, 145, "INGREDIENT"], [146, 153, "QUANTITY"], [154, 159, "INGREDIENT"], [160, 172, "QUANTITY"], [173, 177, "INGREDIENT"], [178, 185, "QUANTITY"], [186, 204, "INGREDIENT"], [214, 227, "QUANTITY"], [228, 278, "INGREDIENT"], [356, 363, "INGREDIENT"], [372, 388, "INGREDIENT"], [411, 414, "PROCESS"], [428, 433, "INGREDIENT"], [435, 444, "INGREDIENT"], [446, 451, "INGREDIENT"], [457, 461, "INGREDIENT"], [477, 481, "PROCESS"], [483, 491, "PROCESS"], [532, 536, "PROCESS"], [720, 725, "PROCESS"], [771, 778, "INGREDIENT"], [847, 851, "PROCESS"], [971, 980, "INGREDIENT"], [985, 993, "PROCESS"], [1016, 1025, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
