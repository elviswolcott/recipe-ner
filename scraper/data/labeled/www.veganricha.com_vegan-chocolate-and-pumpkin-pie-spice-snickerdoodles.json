["Ingredients:\n3/4 cup almond flour\n1/2 cup oat flour (Certified gluten-free if needed)\n1 tbsp tapioca or cornstarch\n1.5 tsp baking powder\n1/4 tsp baking soda\n1/4 tsp salt\n1 tsp pumpkin pie spice (or use chai spice or cinnamon)\n1 tbsp oil\n1/3 cup maple syrup\n1 tbsp cocoa powder\n1 tbsp brown sugar (or coconut sugar)\n1/2 tsp cinnamon\n\nInstructions:\nIn a bowl, mix all the dry ingreients for the cookies until well combined.\nAdd the oil and 1/4 cup of maple syrup and mix well. Add the rest of the 1 tbsp maple syrup, and mix until the dough is a sticky mixture.\nDivide the dough into two bowls. In one of the bowls, add the cocoa powder and mix well. Add a few drops of water, and a tsp or so more of maple syrup to make a sticky dough. The dough should be soft and sticky, and not stiff. Refrigerate for 15-20 minutes so that the dough is easier to handle. You&#039;ll want to refrigerate the dough for at least 20-30 minutes if the dough is too sticky.\nIn a small bowl, mix your cinnamon sugar mixture if using.\nTake the dough mixture out of the fridge. Wet your hands take a tbsp of each of the dough and combine them to make one ball. Repeat until you have at least 9 or 10 balls. Coat one side of the ball with cinnamon sugar mixture, and place on a parchment lined baking sheet.\nPress a fork to press the ball down. Press it down to a pretty thin cookie. Then bake at 350 degrees F (180c) for 13-14 minutes.\nRemove the sheet from the oven, let the cookies cool for 2 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack.\nThese cookies can be stored on the counter for up to 2 weeks.", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 33, "INGREDIENT"], [34, 41, "QUANTITY"], [42, 51, "INGREDIENT"], [86, 92, "QUANTITY"], [93, 114, "INGREDIENT"], [123, 136, "INGREDIENT"], [137, 144, "QUANTITY"], [145, 156, "INGREDIENT"], [157, 164, "QUANTITY"], [165, 169, "INGREDIENT"], [170, 175, "QUANTITY"], [176, 193, "INGREDIENT"], [202, 212, "INGREDIENT"], [216, 224, "INGREDIENT"], [226, 232, "QUANTITY"], [233, 236, "INGREDIENT"], [237, 244, "QUANTITY"], [245, 256, "INGREDIENT"], [257, 263, "QUANTITY"], [264, 276, "INGREDIENT"], [277, 283, "QUANTITY"], [284, 295, "INGREDIENT"], [300, 313, "INGREDIENT"], [315, 322, "QUANTITY"], [323, 331, "INGREDIENT"], [358, 361, "PROCESS"], [430, 433, "INGREDIENT"], [438, 445, "QUANTITY"], [446, 460, "INGREDIENT"], [465, 468, "PROCESS"], [495, 501, "QUANTITY"], [502, 513, "INGREDIENT"], [519, 522, "PROCESS"], [614, 617, "PROCESS"], [622, 634, "INGREDIENT"], [639, 642, "PROCESS"], [665, 673, "INGREDIENT"], [685, 690, "INGREDIENT"], [696, 710, "INGREDIENT"], [970, 973, "PROCESS"], [979, 987, "INGREDIENT"], [988, 993, "INGREDIENT"], [1084, 1088, "INGREDIENT"], [1214, 1222, "INGREDIENT"], [1223, 1228, "INGREDIENT"], [1242, 1247, "PROCESS"], [1269, 1275, "PROCESS"], [1299, 1304, "PROCESS"], [1346, 1350, "PROCESS"], [1364, 1368, "PROCESS"], [1527, 1530, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
