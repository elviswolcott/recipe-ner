["Ingredients:\n1 1/2 cups raw cashews\n2 cups water\n3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice\n1/2 cup nutritional yeast\n1/4 teaspoon  turmeric\n1/2 teaspoon garlic powder\n1 1/2 teaspoons salt\n1 (7-oz) bag shredded vegan cheddar cheese, optional (I used Follow Your Heart)\n12 ounces elbow pasta\n1 1/2 cups panko breadcrumbs\n4 tablespoons vegan butter, melted\n1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat oven and prep - If planning on baking it with the breadcrumb topping, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and lightly grease a casserole dish (I used a 9x13 inch dish). Skip this step for stovetop mac and cheese.\nSoak the cashews - Soften your cashews by covering them in boiling water for 5 minutes. I do this by heating up water in my tea kettle, and then pouring the boiling water over the cashews in a large glass measuring cup.\u00c2\u00a0\nCook pasta - Cook the pasta according to package instructions, but do not overcook.\u00c2\u00a0Drain and set aside.\nBlend cheese sauce - Drain the soaked cashews and discard the soaking water. Add the cashews, 2 cups fresh water, lemon juice, nutritional yeast, turmeric, garlic powder, salt and bag of shredded cheese (if using) to a high powered blender and blend until very smooth.", {"entities": [[13, 23, "QUANTITY"], [24, 35, "INGREDIENT"], [36, 42, "QUANTITY"], [43, 48, "INGREDIENT"], [49, 62, "QUANTITY"], [63, 80, "INGREDIENT"], [81, 88, "QUANTITY"], [89, 106, "INGREDIENT"], [107, 119, "QUANTITY"], [121, 129, "INGREDIENT"], [130, 142, "QUANTITY"], [143, 156, "INGREDIENT"], [157, 172, "QUANTITY"], [173, 177, "INGREDIENT"], [191, 213, "INGREDIENT"], [258, 267, "QUANTITY"], [268, 279, "INGREDIENT"], [280, 290, "QUANTITY"], [291, 308, "INGREDIENT"], [309, 322, "QUANTITY"], [323, 343, "INGREDIENT"], [344, 356, "QUANTITY"], [357, 371, "INGREDIENT"], [426, 432, "PROCESS"], [615, 622, "INGREDIENT"], [637, 644, "INGREDIENT"], [665, 678, "INGREDIENT"], [718, 723, "INGREDIENT"], [763, 776, "INGREDIENT"], [786, 793, "INGREDIENT"], [821, 824, "QUANTITY"], [833, 838, "INGREDIENT"], [850, 855, "INGREDIENT"], [965, 979, "INGREDIENT"], [1004, 1009, "INGREDIENT"], [1019, 1026, "INGREDIENT"], [1028, 1034, "QUANTITY"], [1035, 1040, "INGREDIENT"], [1041, 1046, "INGREDIENT"], [1048, 1059, "INGREDIENT"], [1061, 1078, "INGREDIENT"], [1080, 1088, "INGREDIENT"], [1090, 1103, "INGREDIENT"], [1105, 1109, "INGREDIENT"], [1121, 1129, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
