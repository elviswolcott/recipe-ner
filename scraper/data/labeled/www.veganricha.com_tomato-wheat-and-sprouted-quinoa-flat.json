["Ingredients:\n2/3 cup bread flour + 1/4 more for kneading (dusting)\n1/2 cup whole wheat flour ((Use bread flour for totally white and even squishier buns))\n3 Tablespoons sprouted quinoa ((can be substituted with cooked quinoa or left out or use any other sprouted grain))\n1 teaspoon raw sugar or equivalent jaggery/agave/maple syrup or other sweeteners.\n1.5 teaspoons quick rise yeast\n1/4 cup water\n2 Tablespoons Virgin olive oil\n3/4 teaspoon salt or to taste\n1  roma tomato or any juicy medium tomato\n1/2 teaspoon dried basil flakes\n\nInstructions:\nAdd the yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar to 2 Tablespoons warm water and mix well. Let stand for 10 minutes or until frothy.\nPuree the tomato, salt, oil and the sprouted quinoa into a well blended puree.\nAdd in the flours, basil to the yeast mixture and mix.\nAdd in the tomato puree and give a mix for a few seconds.\nKnead the dough for 4-5 minutes by hand or in mixer, scraping sides every 2 minutes if using a stand mixer. add more bread flour or water in little quantities if needed to get a soft dough.\nPlace dough in greased container, spritz top with water and then with oil. Cover with a towel and let rise for an hour. You can refrigerate the dough at this point for upto 2 days.\nIf refrigerated, then let dough rest outside for an hour to reach normal temperature.\nDivide dough into 3-4 balls depending on size of flat bread you want. (Or you can shape it into a loaf, place in mini loaf pan, let rise for 30 minutes and bake at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes.)\nForm balls, and roll out on well floured surface. I made 5 inch rounds, nicely thick flat breads to use as buns for our portabello sandwiches.\nHeat a grill pan to high heat and grill the flat breads when the pan is hot, 2-3 minutes each side. Use thick bottomed pan or grill pan, well heated on high heat. Or bake in oven preheated to 450 degrees F, on hot pizza stone, like a Pita bread.\nCut up the flat bread into triangles and dip in some herbed olive oil or enjoy as is. or use for your favorite burger/sandwich!
