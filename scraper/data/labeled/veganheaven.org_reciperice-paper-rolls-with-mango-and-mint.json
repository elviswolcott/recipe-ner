["Ingredients:\n6  sheets Vietnamese rice paper\n1  avocado\n1  cucumber\n3 small carrots\n1  mango\n3  green onions, cut into rings\n1 cup purple cabbage, cut into thin stripes\nabout 6  radishes, cut into thin slices\n1 cup fresh mint\n2-3 cups lettuce, cut into thin stripes\n1 - 1 1/2 cups cooked glass noodles\n7 oz block firm tofu\n1 teaspoon sesame oil\n1 tablespoon soy sauce\n1 tablespoon sesame seeds\n1/4 cup chunky peanut butter\n2 teaspoons soy sauce\n1  clove of garlic, minced\n3-4 tablespoons warm water\n1/2 teaspoons sriracha sauce ((optional))\n\nInstructions:\nCut the avocado, the carrots, the mango, the lettuce, and the purple cabbage into thing stripes.\nWhen you're done cutting the veggies, fill a shallow bowl with water and dip the rice papers in water so they get moderately wet on both sides. Don't let them soak too long, so they don't get too soft.\nFirst make the tofu (it's optional but really yummy): Cut the tofu into thin stripes (about 0.10 inches thick) and heat the sesame oil in a medium-sized pan. Add the tofu and the soy sauce and cook for about 4 minutes until the tofu is brown and crispy. Then add the sesame seeds and cook for another minute.\nWhen you soaked the rice papers, fill them with the veggies and the tofu (if using) and wrap them like a burrito. I think it's best to center the filling and then roll it up and fold in the two side flaps.\nThen make the peanut dipping sauce: In a medium bowl, combine the peanut butter with the soy sauce, the garlic, the warm water, and the sriracha sauce.\nServe the rice paper rolls with the peanut dipping sauce.", {"entities": [[34, 38, "INGREDIENT"], [76, 83, "INGREDIENT"], [96, 108, "INGREDIENT"], [125, 130, "QUANTITY"], [131, 168, "INGREDIENT"], [197, 201, "PROCESS"], [209, 214, "QUANTITY"], [215, 225, "INGREDIENT"], [228, 234, "QUANTITY"], [235, 265, "INGREDIENT"], [270, 280, "QUANTITY"], [281, 301, "INGREDIENT"], [302, 306, "QUANTITY"], [307, 322, "INGREDIENT"], [323, 333, "QUANTITY"], [334, 344, "INGREDIENT"], [345, 357, "QUANTITY"], [358, 367, "INGREDIENT"], [368, 380, "QUANTITY"], [381, 393, "INGREDIENT"], [394, 401, "QUANTITY"], [402, 422, "INGREDIENT"], [423, 434, "QUANTITY"], [435, 444, "INGREDIENT"], [457, 463, "INGREDIENT"], [465, 471, "INGREDIENT"], [474, 487, "QUANTITY"], [488, 498, "INGREDIENT"], [499, 512, "QUANTITY"], [513, 527, "INGREDIENT"], [577, 584, "INGREDIENT"], [682, 689, "INGREDIENT"], [716, 721, "INGREDIENT"], [734, 738, "INGREDIENT"], [749, 754, "INGREDIENT"], [870, 874, "INGREDIENT"], [917, 921, "INGREDIENT"], [927, 931, "PROCESS"], [979, 989, "INGREDIENT"], [1021, 1025, "INGREDIENT"], [1034, 1043, "INGREDIENT"], [1048, 1052, "PROCESS"], [1083, 1087, "INGREDIENT"], [1114, 1117, "PROCESS"], [1122, 1134, "INGREDIENT"], [1139, 1143, "PROCESS"], [1173, 1179, "INGREDIENT"], [1184, 1188, "INGREDIENT"], [1216, 1223, "INGREDIENT"], [1232, 1236, "INGREDIENT"], [1252, 1256, "PROCESS"], [1436, 1449, "INGREDIENT"], [1459, 1469, "INGREDIENT"], [1474, 1480, "INGREDIENT"], [1486, 1496, "INGREDIENT"], [1506, 1520, "INGREDIENT"], [1532, 1536, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
