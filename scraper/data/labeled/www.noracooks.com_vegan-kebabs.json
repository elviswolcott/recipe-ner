["Ingredients:\n8 ounce bag soy curls (see notes for options)\n2 medium zucchini, sliced into thick rounds\n1 large yellow summer squash, sliced into thick rounds\n1  red bell pepper, cut into chunks\n1  green bell pepper, cut into chunks\n1  red onion, cut into chunks\n1/2 cup olive oil\n1/4 cup lemon juice\n1/4 cup water\n2 tablespoons dijon mustard\n2 tablespoons agave\n4 cloves garlic, minced\n1 teaspoon  dried oregano\n1 teaspoon dried basil\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper\n\nInstructions:\nIf using bamboo skewer sticks, soak them in warm water for 10-30 minutes while you prepare all the vegetables. This will help them not burn on the grill!\nIn a large bowl, add the dehydrated soy curls, then cover with about 4 cups of hot water. Let them rehydrate for about 10 minutes until they have grown in size and softened. Drain in a colander and squeeze any excess water from the pieces.\nIn a large bowl (large enough to fit all the veggies and soy curls), whisk together the marinade ingredients. Add all the large pieces of soy curls to the marinade and the veggies, stir to coat and let marinate for at least 30 minutes. 4-5 hours is best! Save the little pieces of soy curls for another recipe or simply mix with a little bbq sauce and eat on a sandwich or salad.\nThread all the vegetables and larger pieces of soy curls onto the skewers until you have used everything up. The soy curls are a little delicate, so only use the larger pieces. They will thread just fine.\nTO GRILL: Preheat the grill between 400-450 degrees F.\u00c2\u00a0 Place the kebabs on the grill and grill for 15-20 minutes, depending on how cooked/softened you want the vegetables to be. Turn the kebabs every 5 minutes or so and let them char a little bit.\nOVEN: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Place the skewers on a large baking sheet or two lined with parchment paper. Bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes, flipping the skewers after 15 minutes.\nServe immediately. I like to eat them with some rice or potato wedges.
