The dough should be soft and not too sticky.\nSpritz the top of dough with some oil spray. Place dough in a covered container in a warm place for 1.5 hours.\nPunch it lightly. For mini loaf pans, divide dough into 2 parts. Knead and shape into a loaf by pulling on all sides, or by rolling it out into a rectangle and rolling the rectangle from one side and tucking the other edge under.\nPlace loaf in greased mini bread pans. Spritz the top with water and then spritz a little oil spray and cover with damp towel.\nPlace it in a warm place or warm oven for 50 minutes.\nRemove towel, spritz top with some water and bake at 365 degrees F for 25 minutes.
