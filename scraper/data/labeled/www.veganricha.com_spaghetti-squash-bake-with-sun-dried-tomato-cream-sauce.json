["Ingredients:\n1  Spaghetti Squash\n3 cloves minced garlic\n3-4 ounces chopped spinach\nsalt and pepper to taste\n7 oz silken tofu (or firm tofu)\n1/2 tsp garlic powder\n1/2 tsp onion powder\n1/2 tsp oregano basil and thyme (or use 1 1/2 tsp italian seasoning)\n1 tbsp Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n3 tbsp sundried tomato\n2 Tbsps nutritional yeast\n1/2 tsp salt\n1 1/4 cup non dairy milk\n2 tsp cornstarch or arrowroot starch\nfresh basil or herbs, pepper flakes, vegan Parmesan  or breadcrumbs\n\nInstructions:\nCook the spaghetti squash in the Instant Pot:  Place the spaghetti squash on a trivet, add 1 1/2 cups of water to the inner pot, then lower into the instant pot. Close the lid, and pressure cook for 10 minutes. Let the pressure release naturally.\nCarefully lift out the trivet with the spaghetti squash from the instant pot. Let the squash cool for 5-10 minutes, then slice open. Use a spoon to scoop out the seeds. The squash will be well cooked and soft at this point. You can convert it into noodles using a fork by pulling the fork through the squash, from the end to the top. The longer the stroke, the longer noodles you&#039;ll get. Set the noodles aside.\nSun dried tomato Sauce: Blend all the ingredients for the sundried tomato cream sauce until well blended. Blend for a minute, let it sit for a few minutes so the sundried tomato can rehydrate, then blend again until the mixture is smooth and creamy.", {"entities": [[16, 25, "INGREDIENT"], [35, 41, "INGREDIENT"], [42, 55, "INGREDIENT"], [58, 66, "QUANTITY"], [67, 82, "INGREDIENT"], [83, 87, "INGREDIENT"], [92, 98, "INGREDIENT"], [108, 112, "QUANTITY"], [113, 124, "INGREDIENT"], [129, 138, "INGREDIENT"], [140, 147, "QUANTITY"], [148, 161, "INGREDIENT"], [162, 169, "QUANTITY"], [170, 182, "INGREDIENT"], [183, 190, "QUANTITY"], [191, 214, "INGREDIENT"], [223, 232, "QUANTITY"], [233, 250, "INGREDIENT"], [252, 258, "QUANTITY"], [259, 281, "INGREDIENT"], [282, 288, "QUANTITY"], [289, 304, "INGREDIENT"], [305, 312, "QUANTITY"], [313, 330, "INGREDIENT"], [331, 338, "QUANTITY"], [339, 343, "INGREDIENT"], [344, 353, "QUANTITY"], [354, 368, "INGREDIENT"], [369, 374, "QUANTITY"], [375, 405, "INGREDIENT"], [406, 417, "INGREDIENT"], [421, 426, "INGREDIENT"], [428, 441, "INGREDIENT"], [462, 473, "INGREDIENT"], [498, 507, "INGREDIENT"], [546, 555, "INGREDIENT"], [576, 579, "PROCESS"], [580, 590, "QUANTITY"], [591, 599, "INGREDIENT"], [679, 683, "PROCESS"], [775, 784, "INGREDIENT"], [898, 903, "INGREDIENT"], [929, 935, "PROCESS"], [964, 967, "INGREDIENT"], [1162, 1168, "INGREDIENT"], [1210, 1225, "INGREDIENT"], [1314, 1329, "INGREDIENT"], [1330, 1333, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
