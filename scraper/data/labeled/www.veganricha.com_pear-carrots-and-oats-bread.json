["Ingredients:\n3 cups bread flour\n1/2 cup whole wheat flour\n1/2 cup quick cooking oats\n1  medium pear pureed without seeds\n1/2 cup carrot puree\n1/4 cup warm water\n1  packet quick rise yeast\n1 tablespoon brown sugar\n1 teaspoon salt\n1/4 teaspoon pepper\n2 teaspoons vegan butter softened\noil for greasing\nmore water or flour if needed.\n\nInstructions:\nMix the yeast and sugar in 2 tablespoons warm water and keep aside for 10 minutes.\nPuree the pear and carrots separately. Use some water if required.\nIn the mixer bowl add in all the dry ingredients and mix well.\nAdd in the purees, butter, and yeast mixture and knead in mixer or by hand (total atleast 10 mins) until a soft dough is formed. I kneaded in the mixer 2-3 minutes at a time, to get a nice ball of dough with good gluten development. The dough should be non sticky and soft. The carrots and pear will leak moisture in the dough, so keep it a bit dry and non sticky. Add more water/bread flour if required.\nPlace dough in well greased container. Spray dough with cooking oil spray. Cover with plastic wrap and keep in a warm place for an hour.\nTake dough out, punch it down and knead for a minute. Use a little bread flour if the dough gets sticky.\nUsing boule technique, pull on all sides and tuck under. Shape into an oblong shape and place loaf with tucked side down, in greased bread pan.\nSpritz top with oil spray. Cover with a kitchen towel and let rise for another 45 minutes.\nPlace bread pan in middle rack of pre-heated oven and bake at 380 degrees F for 25 minutes. Rotate bread pan by 180degrees for even bake and bake for another 10-15minutes .\nCool completely on rack before slicing. I usually also put the cooled bread in the fridge for half an hour before slicing. That cools the core and makes it a little stiff and hence easier to slice without squishing.", {"entities": [[15, 31, "INGREDIENT"], [32, 39, "QUANTITY"], [40, 57, "INGREDIENT"], [58, 65, "QUANTITY"], [66, 84, "INGREDIENT"], [115, 120, "INGREDIENT"], [121, 128, "QUANTITY"], [129, 141, "INGREDIENT"], [146, 160, "INGREDIENT"], [171, 187, "INGREDIENT"], [188, 200, "QUANTITY"], [201, 212, "INGREDIENT"], [213, 223, "QUANTITY"], [224, 228, "INGREDIENT"], [229, 241, "QUANTITY"], [242, 248, "INGREDIENT"], [249, 260, "QUANTITY"], [261, 282, "INGREDIENT"], [283, 299, "INGREDIENT"], [305, 310, "INGREDIENT"], [314, 319, "INGREDIENT"], [354, 359, "INGREDIENT"], [364, 369, "INGREDIENT"], [373, 386, "QUANTITY"], [387, 397, "INGREDIENT"], [448, 455, "INGREDIENT"], [477, 482, "INGREDIENT"], [514, 517, "PROCESS"], [549, 552, "PROCESS"], [578, 584, "INGREDIENT"], [590, 595, "INGREDIENT"], [608, 613, "PROCESS"], [635, 640, "INGREDIENT"], [837, 844, "INGREDIENT"], [933, 938, "INGREDIENT"], [939, 950, "INGREDIENT"], [1020, 1027, "PROCESS"], [1028, 1031, "INGREDIENT"], [1058, 1062, "PROCESS"], [1082, 1087, "PROCESS"], [1135, 1140, "PROCESS"], [1168, 1179, "INGREDIENT"], [1294, 1299, "PROCESS"], [1366, 1369, "INGREDIENT"], [1495, 1499, "PROCESS"], [1573, 1577, "PROCESS"], [1582, 1586, "PROCESS"]]}]
