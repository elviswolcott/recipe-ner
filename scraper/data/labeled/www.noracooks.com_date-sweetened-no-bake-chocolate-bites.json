["Ingredients:\n1 1/2 cups raw walnuts\n10  large soft medjool dates (pitted)\n4 tablespoons cocoa powder\n1 tablespoon water (optional)\n\nInstructions:\nIn a food processor with an \"S\" blade, add the walnuts, dates and cocoa powder.\nProcess until a sticky dough is formed, about 1-2 minutes. You may need to scrape the sides of your food processor a few times so that it will come together. You should be able to easily roll it into balls without the dough falling apart.\nIf it still seems dry, add 1 tablespoon of water at a time until the dough is sticky and uniform, being careful not to add too much water.\nRoll into tablespoon sized balls and place in a container. Store in the fridge or freezer.", {"entities": [[13, 23, "QUANTITY"], [24, 35, "INGREDIENT"], [46, 64, "INGREDIENT"], [74, 87, "QUANTITY"], [88, 100, "INGREDIENT"], [101, 113, "QUANTITY"], [114, 119, "INGREDIENT"], [185, 188, "PROCESS"], [193, 200, "INGREDIENT"], [202, 207, "INGREDIENT"], [212, 224, "INGREDIENT"], [488, 491, "PROCESS"], [492, 504, "QUANTITY"], [505, 513, "INGREDIENT"], [584, 587, "PROCESS"], [597, 602, "INGREDIENT"], [641, 646, "PROCESS"]]}]
