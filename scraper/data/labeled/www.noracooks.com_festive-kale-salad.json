["Ingredients:\n2 large bunches kale (about 9 cups chopped)\n1/2 cup dried sweetened cranberries\n1/3 cup fresh lemon juice\n2 teaspoons dijon mustard\n2 tablespoons pure maple syrup\n2  garlic cloves, minced\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n1 cup raw pecans\n2 tablespoons nutritional yeast\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n\nInstructions:\nPrepare the kale: Remove the stems from the kale. I use a knife, but you can also use your hands. Finely chop the kale leaves. Wash the kale and then spin it dry, using a salad spinner.\nMake the dressing: In a small jar with a lid, combine all the dressing ingredients. Put the lid on, and shake until combined. You could also whisk the ingredients in a small bowl.\nMassage the salad: Add the washed, chopped kale to a large bowl. Pour the dressing on top and gently massage it into the kale. The leaves will turn a darker green and soften slightly. Stop when the volume of greens is reduced by about half.\nMake the Pecan Parmesan: Add the pecans, nutritional yeast and salt to a food processor. Pulse until it's a coarse crumb texture, withe some pecan pieces left. You don't want it to be a fine powder; you want some texture left. It won't take long.\nPut the salad together: Sprinkle the pecan parmesan over the massaged greens, and then add the dried cranberries. Serve and enjoy!\nThis salad will save for about 1 day in the refrigerator, but not longer than that. It's best the day you make it! It will serve 4-6 as a small side salad, and 2 as a main dish salad. Double if needed for large get togethers or holidays.", {"entities": [[29, 33, "INGREDIENT"], [41, 47, "QUANTITY"], [48, 55, "INGREDIENT"], [57, 64, "QUANTITY"], [65, 92, "INGREDIENT"], [93, 100, "QUANTITY"], [101, 118, "INGREDIENT"], [119, 130, "QUANTITY"], [131, 144, "INGREDIENT"], [145, 158, "QUANTITY"], [159, 175, "INGREDIENT"], [179, 185, "INGREDIENT"], [186, 192, "INGREDIENT"], [194, 200, "INGREDIENT"], [201, 213, "QUANTITY"], [214, 218, "INGREDIENT"], [219, 224, "QUANTITY"], [225, 235, "INGREDIENT"], [236, 249, "QUANTITY"], [250, 267, "INGREDIENT"], [268, 280, "QUANTITY"], [281, 285, "INGREDIENT"], [313, 317, "INGREDIENT"], [345, 349, "INGREDIENT"], [374, 377, "INGREDIENT"], [415, 419, "INGREDIENT"], [437, 441, "INGREDIENT"], [628, 633, "PROCESS"], [702, 714, "INGREDIENT"], [788, 792, "INGREDIENT"], [941, 948, "INGREDIENT"], [949, 966, "INGREDIENT"], [971, 975, "INGREDIENT"], [1242, 1245, "PROCESS"], [1250, 1267, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
