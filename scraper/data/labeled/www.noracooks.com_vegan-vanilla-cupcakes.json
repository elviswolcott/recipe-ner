["Ingredients:\n1 1/2 cups unsweetened soy milk ((or use another non-dairy milk))\n1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar\n2 3/4 cups cake flour*\n1 1/2  cups granulated sugar\n1 tablespoon baking powder\n1 1/2 teaspoons salt\n1/2 cup canola oil\n1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract\n1 Recipe Vegan Vanilla Frosting\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners. I usually spray the liners with a little oil as well to prevent sticking.\nCombine the soy milk and apple cider vinegar in a measuring cup or bowl, give a little stir and set aside for a few minutes to curdle.\nIn a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt until combined.\nNow pour in the milk/vinegar mixture, canola oil and vanilla. Stir with the whisk, large spoon or a hand mixer until well combined. There may be a few small lumps, but you don&#039;t want any large lumps in the batter.\nFill the liners 3/4 of the way full and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. Carefully transfer the cupcakes to a cooling rack, then place new liners in the pan (probably about 6 more) and bake the rest of the cupcakes until you have used all the batter.\nCool completely, then pipe on Vegan Vanilla Frosting or Vegan Chocolate Frosting.", {"entities": [[13, 23, "QUANTITY"], [24, 44, "INGREDIENT"], [62, 76, "INGREDIENT"], [79, 89, "QUANTITY"], [90, 109, "INGREDIENT"], [110, 120, "QUANTITY"], [121, 132, "INGREDIENT"], [133, 144, "QUANTITY"], [145, 161, "INGREDIENT"], [162, 174, "QUANTITY"], [175, 188, "INGREDIENT"], [189, 204, "QUANTITY"], [205, 209, "INGREDIENT"], [210, 217, "QUANTITY"], [218, 228, "INGREDIENT"], [229, 241, "QUANTITY"], [242, 262, "INGREDIENT"], [358, 361, "QUANTITY"], [433, 436, "INGREDIENT"], [478, 486, "INGREDIENT"], [491, 510, "INGREDIENT"], [526, 529, "QUANTITY"], [553, 557, "PROCESS"], [618, 623, "PROCESS"], [637, 642, "INGREDIENT"], [644, 649, "INGREDIENT"], [651, 664, "INGREDIENT"], [669, 673, "INGREDIENT"], [706, 710, "INGREDIENT"], [711, 718, "INGREDIENT"], [728, 738, "INGREDIENT"], [743, 750, "INGREDIENT"], [766, 771, "PROCESS"], [949, 953, "PROCESS"], [1067, 1072, "PROCESS"], [1123, 1127, "PROCESS"], [1251, 1260, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
