["Ingredients:\n1 cup creamy peanut butter\n6 tablespoons vegan butter, softened\n2 cups powdered sugar\n1 cup Rice Krispies cereal\n2 cups vegan chocolate chips (12 oz, 1 bag)\n2 tablespoons refined coconut oil\n\nInstructions:\nAdd the peanut butter and softened vegan butter to a large bowl. Using a hand mixer, mix until combined, about 1 minute. Now add the powdered sugar and Rice Krispies cereal. Mix together on low speed until combined, it will be thick.\nForm tablespoon sized balls and place on a pan lined with parchment paper. Place in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to chill.\nIn a medium bowl, melt the chocolate and coconut oil in the microwave, or on the stovetop if desired. I microwave in 30 second intervals, stirring in between until melted.\nDip each peanut butter ball into the melted chocolate (I used a fork to help me). Tap off some of the excess chocolate and place back onto the parchment lined pan.\nOnce all the peanut butter balls are covered in chocolate, place them back in the refrigerator to set, about 15 minutes. Drizzle any remaining melted chocolate over the balls, if desired. Store peanut butter balls in the refrigerator, they will get quite soft at room temperature if left out for long.", {"entities": [[13, 18, "QUANTITY"], [19, 39, "INGREDIENT"], [40, 53, "QUANTITY"], [54, 76, "INGREDIENT"], [77, 83, "QUANTITY"], [84, 98, "INGREDIENT"], [99, 104, "QUANTITY"], [105, 125, "INGREDIENT"], [126, 132, "QUANTITY"], [133, 154, "INGREDIENT"], [156, 161, "QUANTITY"], [170, 183, "QUANTITY"], [184, 203, "INGREDIENT"], [227, 240, "INGREDIENT"], [245, 266, "INGREDIENT"], [304, 307, "PROCESS"], [344, 347, "PROCESS"], [352, 366, "INGREDIENT"], [371, 391, "INGREDIENT"], [485, 490, "PROCESS"], [615, 624, "INGREDIENT"], [629, 640, "INGREDIENT"], [726, 734, "PROCESS"], [764, 768, "INGREDIENT"], [769, 782, "INGREDIENT"], [804, 813, "INGREDIENT"], [869, 878, "INGREDIENT"], [883, 888, "PROCESS"], [937, 950, "INGREDIENT"], [972, 981, "INGREDIENT"], [983, 988, "PROCESS"], [1074, 1083, "INGREDIENT"], [1118, 1131, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
