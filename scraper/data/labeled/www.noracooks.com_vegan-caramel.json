["Ingredients:\n1 cup coconut cream\n3/4 cup brown sugar\n1 tablespoon cornstarch\noptional: pinch of salt\n\nInstructions:\nIn a small pan or pot, add the coconut cream, brown sugar and cornstarch. Heat over medium-high heat, stirring constantly while the coconut cream melts. The mixture will get bubbly and almost foamy. Lower the heat to a simmer and stir frequently for about 5 minutes. If you want salted caramel, add a pinch of salt.\nRemove from heat. The caramel can be used immediately, or let it cool and it will thicken considerably. Each time you go to use it, give it a good stir. Store leftover caramel in a covered glass container in the refrigerator for about a week.", {"entities": [[13, 18, "QUANTITY"], [19, 32, "INGREDIENT"], [33, 40, "QUANTITY"], [41, 52, "INGREDIENT"], [53, 65, "QUANTITY"], [66, 76, "INGREDIENT"], [87, 100, "INGREDIENT"], [139, 142, "PROCESS"], [147, 160, "INGREDIENT"], [162, 173, "INGREDIENT"], [178, 188, "INGREDIENT"], [218, 226, "PROCESS"], [248, 261, "INGREDIENT"], [346, 350, "PROCESS"], [395, 409, "INGREDIENT"], [411, 414, "PROCESS"], [417, 430, "INGREDIENT"], [462, 465, "INGREDIENT"], [579, 583, "PROCESS"]]}]
