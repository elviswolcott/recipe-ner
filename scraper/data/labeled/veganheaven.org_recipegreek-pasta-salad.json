["Ingredients:\n9 oz pasta (rotini or farfalle)\n2 cups cherry tomatoes, cut into halves\n3/4  English cucumber, cut into quartered pieces\n6  artichoke hearts in brine, drained and roughly chopped ((1 14 oz can))\n1  red onion, cut into stripes\n20  black olives\n1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped\n8 oz very firm tofu\n1/2 cup apple cider vinegar\n2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice\n1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk\n1 teaspoon dried thyme\n3  cloves of garlic, minced\n1 teaspoon salt\n4 tablespoons olive oil\n2  cloves of garlic, minced\n1 teaspoon Dijon mustard\n2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice\n3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar or red wine vinegar\n1 teaspoon dried basil\n1 teaspoon dried oregano\n1 teaspoon dried thyme\nsalt\npepper\n\nInstructions:\nFirst, make the vegan feta cheese: The night before making the salad, cut the tofu into small cubes. In a small bowl, combine all of the ingredients for the marinade. Fill the tofu and the marinade into a ziploc bag and store it overnight in the fridge. If you don't have much time, you could also get away with marinating it for about 4 hours. But it's definitely better if you marinate it for a longer time. Also make sure that you got a very firm tofu. It makes the best texture!\nCook the pasta according to the instructions on the package. Set aside and let it cool down a bit (not completely). Chop the remaining ingredients and make the dressing.\nIn a large bowl, combine all ingredients for the pasta salad including the vegan feta. Add the dressing and toss.\nRefrigerate for at least 2-3 hours before serving.", {"entities": [[13, 17, "QUANTITY"], [18, 23, "INGREDIENT"], [25, 31, "INGREDIENT"], [35, 43, "INGREDIENT"], [45, 51, "QUANTITY"], [52, 84, "INGREDIENT"], [157, 162, "INGREDIENT"], [184, 191, "INGREDIENT"], [194, 201, "QUANTITY"], [202, 205, "INGREDIENT"], [211, 220, "INGREDIENT"], [243, 255, "INGREDIENT"], [256, 263, "QUANTITY"], [264, 286, "INGREDIENT"], [287, 291, "QUANTITY"], [292, 306, "INGREDIENT"], [307, 314, "QUANTITY"], [315, 334, "INGREDIENT"], [335, 348, "QUANTITY"], [349, 366, "INGREDIENT"], [367, 374, "QUANTITY"], [375, 398, "INGREDIENT"], [399, 409, "QUANTITY"], [410, 421, "INGREDIENT"], [425, 431, "INGREDIENT"], [435, 441, "INGREDIENT"], [443, 449, "INGREDIENT"], [450, 460, "QUANTITY"], [461, 465, "INGREDIENT"], [466, 479, "QUANTITY"], [480, 489, "INGREDIENT"], [493, 499, "INGREDIENT"], [503, 509, "INGREDIENT"], [511, 517, "INGREDIENT"], [518, 528, "QUANTITY"], [529, 542, "INGREDIENT"], [543, 556, "QUANTITY"], [557, 574, "INGREDIENT"], [575, 588, "QUANTITY"], [589, 625, "INGREDIENT"], [626, 636, "QUANTITY"], [637, 648, "INGREDIENT"], [649, 659, "QUANTITY"], [660, 673, "INGREDIENT"], [674, 684, "QUANTITY"], [685, 696, "INGREDIENT"], [697, 701, "INGREDIENT"], [702, 708, "INGREDIENT"], [740, 750, "INGREDIENT"], [802, 806, "INGREDIENT"], [900, 904, "INGREDIENT"], [1164, 1178, "INGREDIENT"], [1216, 1221, "INGREDIENT"], [1426, 1431, "INGREDIENT"], [1452, 1462, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
