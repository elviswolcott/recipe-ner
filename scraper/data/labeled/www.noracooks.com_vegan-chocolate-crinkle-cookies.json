["Ingredients:\n1 cup granulated sugar\n1/3 cup canola oil OR melted coconut oil\n1 tablespoon ground flax seeds\n1/3 cup non-dairy milk\n1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n1 1/4 cups all purpose flour\n1/2 cup cocoa powder\n1 teaspoon baking powder\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n1 cup powdered sugar, for rolling\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.\nIn a large bowl, add the sugar and canola oil. Stir with a wooden spoon until well combined and smooth. Add the ground flax seeds, non-dairy milk and vanilla, and mix well to combine.\nSift in the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt using either a sifter or fine mesh strainer.&nbsp;Stir until combined with the wet ingredients and a soft dough is formed.&nbsp;\nPlace the powdered sugar in a small mixing bowl. Scoop out a heaping tablespoon of dough at a time, and shape into a ball. Roll the ball in the powdered sugar very generously, covering all sides. The more powdered sugar, the prettier the cookies will be.\nPlace the balls onto the prepared baking sheet, about 2 inches apart so they have room to spread.\nBake for 10-12 minutes until set. They will appear slightly undercooked and soft, but will firm up as they cool.\nCool on the baking sheet for at least 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack. Store any extra cookies in an airtight container for 4-5 days.
