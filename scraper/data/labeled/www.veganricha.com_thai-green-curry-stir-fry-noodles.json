["Ingredients:\n1  hot green chili (use a mild one if you don't want the heat or remove the seeds for less heat)\n2 cloves of garlic\n1/2 inch piece of ginger\n3/4 cup of packed cilantro with stems\n2 teaspoons lime juice\nzest of 1 lime\n1/2 teaspoon of ground coriander\n1/2 teaspoon of ground cumin\n1/2 teaspoon of salt\n1 cup of coconut milk\n2 teaspoons oil\n7 ounces extra-firm tofu (pressed and cubed)\n2  green onions chopped (keep the greens for garnish)\n1  red bell pepper (thinly sliced)\n1/2-1 cup of other vegetables of choice such as mushrooms (broccoli, baby eggplant)\n6 ounces of rice noodles or linguini (cooked according to the instructions on the package)\npepper flakes,  (black pepper and green onions for garnish)\n\nInstructions:\nMake the green curry paste. Add all of the ingredients to a blender and blend until smooth and set aside.\nCook the noodles according to instruction on package and set aside.\nHeat a skillet over medium high heat. Add oil. Add the tofu and cook until the tofu is golden in the edges then add in the white parts of the onion and bell pepper and other veggies that you're using.\nAdd a good dash of salt and cook for 3-4 minutes. Move the veggies to the edge of \u00c2\u00a0the skillet so that you can pour the green curry paste in the middle. Pour the green curry in.\nOnce the paste is starting to boil, mix it in. Add in the noodles and toss well to coat. Taste and adjust salt and flavor. I usually add in 1/2 a teaspoon of sugar at this point to balance out the flavor. Adjust the salt, and sweet, and heat at the end. Then serve with pepper flakes, black pepper and green onions as garnish.", {"entities": [[89, 94, "INGREDIENT"], [112, 118, "INGREDIENT"], [122, 128, "INGREDIENT"], [147, 153, "INGREDIENT"], [154, 161, "QUANTITY"], [162, 191, "INGREDIENT"], [192, 203, "QUANTITY"], [204, 214, "INGREDIENT"], [230, 242, "QUANTITY"], [243, 262, "INGREDIENT"], [263, 275, "QUANTITY"], [276, 291, "INGREDIENT"], [292, 304, "QUANTITY"], [305, 312, "INGREDIENT"], [313, 318, "QUANTITY"], [319, 334, "INGREDIENT"], [335, 346, "QUANTITY"], [347, 350, "INGREDIENT"], [351, 359, "QUANTITY"], [360, 375, "INGREDIENT"], [377, 384, "PROCESS"], [389, 394, "INGREDIENT"], [399, 411, "INGREDIENT"], [412, 419, "INGREDIENT"], [453, 468, "INGREDIENT"], [470, 483, "INGREDIENT"], [489, 494, "QUANTITY"], [495, 542, "INGREDIENT"], [544, 552, "INGREDIENT"], [569, 577, "QUANTITY"], [578, 605, "INGREDIENT"], [607, 613, "INGREDIENT"], [660, 673, "INGREDIENT"], [677, 689, "INGREDIENT"], [694, 706, "INGREDIENT"], [744, 761, "INGREDIENT"], [951, 954, "INGREDIENT"], [964, 968, "INGREDIENT"], [973, 977, "PROCESS"], [988, 992, "INGREDIENT"], [1021, 1024, "PROCESS"], [1051, 1056, "INGREDIENT"], [1061, 1072, "INGREDIENT"], [1077, 1090, "INGREDIENT"], [1126, 1133, "INGREDIENT"], [1138, 1142, "PROCESS"], [1169, 1176, "INGREDIENT"], [1218, 1221, "INGREDIENT"], [1231, 1248, "INGREDIENT"], [1279, 1284, "INGREDIENT"], [1298, 1303, "INGREDIENT"], [1319, 1323, "PROCESS"], [1325, 1328, "PROCESS"], [1395, 1399, "INGREDIENT"], [1422, 1425, "PROCESS"], [1444, 1452, "INGREDIENT"], [1505, 1509, "INGREDIENT"], [1559, 1572, "INGREDIENT"], [1574, 1586, "INGREDIENT"], [1591, 1603, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
