["Ingredients:\n1 tablespoon ground flax\n2.5 tablespoons water\n3/4 cup all purpose flour\n1 cup almond flour\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/4 teaspoon baking soda\n8 tablespoon cocoa powder\n1/4 cup vegan butter\n3/4 cup dairy free chocolate chips, divided\n1/4 cup water\n1 1/2 cups sugar\n1 teaspoon vanilla\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly grease an 8x8 inch baking pan or line with parchment paper.\nPrepare the flax egg by combining ground flax and water in a small bowl. Set aside to let thicken for a few minutes.\nIn a medium bowl, combine the flour, almond flour, salt and baking soda. Set aside.\nIn a large microwave safe bowl, add the cocoa, vegan butter, 1/2 cup chocolate chips and water. Melt in the microwave in 30 second increments until mostly melted, and stir well at each interval. It took me 2 minutes.\nAdd the sugar and vanilla to the melted chocolate mixture. Mix well with a wooden spoon. Now add the flax egg and mix again until well combined.\nAdd the flour mixture to the large bowl and stir until just combined. The mixture will be thick, that's how it should be, this is what will make them chewy. Fold in the remaining 1/4 cup chocolate chips.\nScoop the brownie batter into prepared pan and press it down evenly with your hands or a spatula. Bake for 25-28 minutes. Let sit for at least 20 minutes before cutting if you can wait that long!", {"entities": [[13, 25, "QUANTITY"], [26, 37, "INGREDIENT"], [54, 59, "INGREDIENT"], [60, 67, "QUANTITY"], [68, 85, "INGREDIENT"], [86, 91, "QUANTITY"], [92, 104, "INGREDIENT"], [105, 117, "QUANTITY"], [118, 122, "INGREDIENT"], [123, 135, "QUANTITY"], [136, 147, "INGREDIENT"], [148, 160, "QUANTITY"], [161, 173, "INGREDIENT"], [174, 181, "QUANTITY"], [182, 194, "INGREDIENT"], [195, 202, "QUANTITY"], [203, 238, "INGREDIENT"], [239, 246, "QUANTITY"], [247, 252, "INGREDIENT"], [253, 263, "QUANTITY"], [264, 269, "INGREDIENT"], [270, 280, "QUANTITY"], [281, 288, "INGREDIENT"], [360, 366, "PROCESS"], [435, 446, "INGREDIENT"], [451, 456, "INGREDIENT"], [548, 553, "INGREDIENT"], [555, 567, "INGREDIENT"], [569, 573, "INGREDIENT"], [578, 590, "INGREDIENT"], [634, 637, "PROCESS"], [642, 647, "INGREDIENT"], [649, 661, "INGREDIENT"], [663, 670, "QUANTITY"], [671, 686, "INGREDIENT"], [691, 696, "INGREDIENT"], [769, 773, "PROCESS"], [782, 786, "INGREDIENT"], [827, 832, "INGREDIENT"], [837, 844, "INGREDIENT"], [859, 868, "INGREDIENT"], [912, 915, "PROCESS"], [933, 936, "PROCESS"], [972, 977, "INGREDIENT"], [1008, 1012, "PROCESS"], [1143, 1150, "QUANTITY"], [1151, 1166, "INGREDIENT"], [1215, 1220, "PROCESS"], [1344, 1347, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
