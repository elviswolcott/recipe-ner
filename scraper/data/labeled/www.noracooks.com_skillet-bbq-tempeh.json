["Ingredients:\n2 (8-oz) packages tempeh\n1 cup water\n2-3 tablespoons olive oil\n18 oz barbecue sauce (*I used Trader Joe&#x27;s Kansas City Style)\n1 Recipe Vegan Mashed Potatoes\n1 Recipe Roasted Brussels Sprouts\n\nInstructions:\nRemove the tempeh from packaging and cut into cubes.\nPlace in a large skillet and add about 1 cup of water, so the tempeh is about half covered. Cover and cook on high heat, steaming the tempeh for about 5 minutes until nearly all of the water has evaporated. Watch closely so it doesn&#x27;t burn. Steaming the tempeh takes away any bitter flavors.\nOnce the water is nearly evaporated, turn the heat down to medium add 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil. Fry the tempeh in the oil for a few minutes, stirring frequently, until golden.\nNow add the entire jar of barbecue sauce and stir to coat. If the tempeh sticks to the pan, use a quality spatula to carefully scrape the pieces off the bottom.\nServe immediately with mashed potatoes and brussels sprouts, rice, or in a sandwich or wrap.
