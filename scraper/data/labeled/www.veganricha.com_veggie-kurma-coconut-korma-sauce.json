["Ingredients:\n1/4  medium onion\n2  medium tomatoes\n5 cloves of garlic\n1/2 inch ginger\n1  green chile  (or add cayenne with the ground spices to taste)\n1/4 tsp fennel seeds\n2 tbsp shredded coconut\n1 tsp oil\n2  bay leaves\n1/2 tsp turmeric\n1/2 tsp garam masala\n1/4 tsp each ground cardamom (, cinnamon)\n1 tsp coriander powder\n1/2 tsp paprika\na dash of black pepper (and cayenne for additional heat)\n1/2  head small Cauliflower (chopped into florets)\n1  medium potato (cubed)\n1/2 to 1 cup veggies such as carrots (zucchini, peppers)\n1 cup cooked chickpeas\n1/4 cup peas\n1 cup water or coconut milk\n1/2 to 3/4 tsp salt\n1/4 tsp sugar or sweetener (optional)\n\nInstructions:\nBlend onion, tomato, ginger, garlic, chile, fennel seeds and coconut until smooth. Add a few tbsp of water if needed. Blend for a minute, then let sit for 5 mins, then blend again. This will help the coconut and fennel seeds to break down and blend.\nAdd oil to a skillet over medium heat. Add bay leaves and cook for a few seconds. (you can add other whole spices such as 2 cloves or 1 slightly opened cardamom pod here for variation). Add the ground spices and mix in. Quickly add the blended mixture(so the ground spices dont burn) and mix in. Add a dash of salt, Cook for 6 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally so the onion gets well roasted.\nWhen the onion tomato mixture is thick and starts to get fragrant(spice and roasted smell), add the veggies and chickpeas and mix in. Add water or coconut milk and salt and cover and cook for 13 to 15 minutes or until the veggies are cooked to preference. Taste and adjust salt and flavor.\nAdd in the peas. Add more coconut milk/cream if needed or some cashew cream for creamier. Simmer for a few minutes. Add 1/4 tsp sweetener if needed and mix in. Garnish with roasted cashews, cilantro, garam masala and sliced green chilies or cayenne for heat. Serve hot with Naan, roti flatbread or rice.", {"entities": [[25, 30, "INGREDIENT"], [41, 49, "INGREDIENT"], [52, 58, "INGREDIENT"], [62, 68, "INGREDIENT"], [78, 84, "INGREDIENT"], [105, 108, "PROCESS"], [109, 116, "INGREDIENT"], [126, 132, "INGREDIENT"], [150, 157, "QUANTITY"], [158, 170, "INGREDIENT"], [171, 177, "QUANTITY"], [178, 194, "INGREDIENT"], [195, 200, "QUANTITY"], [201, 204, "INGREDIENT"], [219, 226, "QUANTITY"], [227, 235, "INGREDIENT"], [236, 243, "QUANTITY"], [244, 256, "INGREDIENT"], [257, 264, "QUANTITY"], [265, 285, "INGREDIENT"], [289, 297, "INGREDIENT"], [299, 304, "QUANTITY"], [305, 321, "INGREDIENT"], [322, 329, "QUANTITY"], [330, 337, "INGREDIENT"], [345, 360, "INGREDIENT"], [366, 373, "INGREDIENT"], [424, 431, "INGREDIENT"], [437, 444, "INGREDIENT"], [456, 462, "INGREDIENT"], [464, 469, "INGREDIENT"], [478, 483, "QUANTITY"], [484, 507, "INGREDIENT"], [528, 533, "QUANTITY"], [534, 550, "INGREDIENT"], [551, 558, "QUANTITY"], [559, 563, "INGREDIENT"], [564, 569, "QUANTITY"], [570, 591, "INGREDIENT"], [596, 611, "INGREDIENT"], [612, 619, "QUANTITY"], [620, 638, "INGREDIENT"], [671, 676, "INGREDIENT"], [678, 684, "INGREDIENT"], [686, 692, "INGREDIENT"], [694, 700, "INGREDIENT"], [709, 721, "INGREDIENT"], [726, 733, "INGREDIENT"], [763, 771, "INGREDIENT"], [865, 872, "INGREDIENT"], [877, 889, "INGREDIENT"], [919, 922, "INGREDIENT"], [973, 977, "PROCESS"], [1002, 1005, "INGREDIENT"], [1006, 1009, "PROCESS"], [1039, 1045, "INGREDIENT"], [1067, 1075, "INGREDIENT"], [1109, 1115, "INGREDIENT"], [1127, 1130, "PROCESS"], [1143, 1146, "PROCESS"], [1174, 1180, "INGREDIENT"], [1203, 1206, "PROCESS"], [1222, 1229, "INGREDIENT"], [1256, 1264, "PROCESS"], [1285, 1290, "INGREDIENT"], [1301, 1308, "PROCESS"], [1319, 1324, "INGREDIENT"], [1325, 1331, "INGREDIENT"], [1386, 1393, "PROCESS"], [1402, 1405, "PROCESS"], [1410, 1417, "INGREDIENT"], [1422, 1431, "INGREDIENT"], [1436, 1439, "PROCESS"], [1448, 1469, "INGREDIENT"], [1474, 1478, "INGREDIENT"], [1493, 1497, "PROCESS"], [1532, 1539, "INGREDIENT"], [1544, 1550, "PROCESS"], [1583, 1587, "INGREDIENT"], [1611, 1615, "INGREDIENT"], [1626, 1638, "INGREDIENT"], [1663, 1675, "INGREDIENT"], [1720, 1727, "QUANTITY"], [1728, 1737, "INGREDIENT"], [1752, 1755, "PROCESS"], [1773, 1780, "PROCESS"], [1781, 1788, "INGREDIENT"], [1790, 1798, "INGREDIENT"], [1800, 1812, "INGREDIENT"], [1841, 1848, "INGREDIENT"], [1898, 1902, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
