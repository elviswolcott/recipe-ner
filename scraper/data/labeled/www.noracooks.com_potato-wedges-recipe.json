["Ingredients:\n4  russet potatoes\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n4  garlic cloves, minced  (or 2 teaspoons garlic powder)\n2 teaspoons onion powder\n1 teaspoon smoked paprika\n1 teaspoon salt\noptional  grated vegan parmesan, I used Violife brand\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees F and lightly grease a large baking pan with oil.&nbsp;\nScrub the potatoes clean. On a cutting board, slice in half lengthwise. Then cut those halfs into thirds or fourths, lengthwise, at an angle, depending on the size of your potatoes.\nPlace the sliced potatoes and all the rest of the ingredients in a large resealable bag (alternatively, use a large bowl.) Seal the bag, then shake to coat the potatoes with the seasonings.\u00c2\u00a0\nSpread the potatoes over the prepared baking sheet, and bake for about 35 minutes, flipping them once halfway through. When they are easily pierced with a fork and golden on the outside, they are done. Sprinkle some grated vegan parmesan on top, if desired, and serve with ketchup for dipping.
