["Ingredients:\n2 tablespoons vegetable broth or olive oil, for sauteing\n1  small sweet onion, chopped\n3  cloves garlic, minced\n1  medium russet potato, peeled and cubed\n3  medium carrots, peeled and chopped\n1/2 cup raw cashews\n4 cups vegetable broth\n1/2 cup nutritional yeast\n1 teaspoon smoked paprika\n1 teaspoon salt, or to taste\n1-2 cups water, as needed (see instructions)\n4 cups bite sized broccoli florets\n\nInstructions:\nIn a large soup pot, saute the onion and garlic in the olive oil for 2-3 minutes over medium heat, stirring frequently.\nTo the pot, add the potato, carrots, cashews, vegetable broth, nutritional yeast, smoked paprika and salt. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for about 15 minutes, until fork tender.\nWorking in batches if needed, transfer the soup carefully to a blender and blend until very smooth.\nReturn the mixture back to the pot. If your soup is too thick, add water until a desired consistency is reached (I used 1 cup of water). Add in the bite sized broccoli florets and stir into the soup.&nbsp;\nBring the soup to a boil, then lower the heat to simmer for 10 minutes, until the broccoli is soft and cooked.&nbsp;\nServe, topping with non-dairy cheddar cheese shreds, if desired.
