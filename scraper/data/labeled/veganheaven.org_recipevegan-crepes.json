["Ingredients:\n2 cups all-purpose flour or spelt flour\n2 1/4 cups unsweetened oat, soy, or almond milk\n2 1/4 cups sparkling water\n1 teaspoon baking powder\n1 teaspoon lemon juice\n2 tablespoons melted coconut oil\n1/2 teaspoon natural vanilla extract\n2-3 tablespoons brown sugar or coconut sugar\n1 teaspoon ground flaxseeds\n1 pinch salt\n\nInstructions:\nCombine the dry ingredients in a medium-sized bowl. Melt the coconut oil in a small pot on the stovetop or in the microwave.\nAdd the sparkling water, the plant-based milk, the coconut oil, the lemon juice, and the vanilla extract. If you want to eat your crepes with a savory filling, leave out the sugar and the vanilla extract.\nStir the batter well with a whisk until there are no lumps left.\nHeat some oil in a large non-stick pan (it should be only lightly oiled) and bake one crepe at a time. Use about 1/4 to 1/2 cup for each crepe depending on the size of your pan. Quickly swirl, so the batter covers the entire bottom of your pan.\nStack the ready crepes on a plate and put them in the oven at around 140 F. This way they will keep warm until you're finished making all of the crepes.", {"entities": [[13, 19, "QUANTITY"], [20, 52, "INGREDIENT"], [53, 63, "QUANTITY"], [64, 100, "INGREDIENT"], [101, 111, "QUANTITY"], [112, 127, "INGREDIENT"], [128, 138, "QUANTITY"], [139, 152, "INGREDIENT"], [153, 163, "QUANTITY"], [164, 175, "INGREDIENT"], [176, 189, "QUANTITY"], [190, 208, "INGREDIENT"], [209, 221, "QUANTITY"], [222, 245, "INGREDIENT"], [248, 261, "QUANTITY"], [262, 290, "INGREDIENT"], [291, 301, "QUANTITY"], [302, 318, "INGREDIENT"], [327, 331, "INGREDIENT"], [408, 419, "INGREDIENT"], [480, 495, "INGREDIENT"], [501, 517, "INGREDIENT"], [523, 534, "INGREDIENT"], [540, 551, "INGREDIENT"], [561, 576, "INGREDIENT"], [646, 651, "INGREDIENT"], [660, 675, "INGREDIENT"], [705, 710, "PROCESS"], [752, 755, "INGREDIENT"], [819, 823, "PROCESS"], [862, 869, "QUANTITY"], [874, 878, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
