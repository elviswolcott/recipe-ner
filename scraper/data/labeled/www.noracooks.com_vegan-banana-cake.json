["Ingredients:\n3 large ripe bananas (1 1/2 cups mashed)\n2 cups unsweetened soy milk\n2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar\n3 tablespoons ground flaxseeds\n3 cups all purpose flour\n2 teaspoons baking powder\n1 teaspoon baking soda\n1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n3/4 cup vegan butter, softened\n1 cup granulated sugar\n1/2 cup brown sugar, packed\n2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract\n8 ounces vegan cream cheese\n1/2 cup vegan butter, softened\n3 cups powdered sugar\n1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\nchopped walnuts, optional for topping\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 350 and grease a 9x13 inch pan.\nMash the bananas in a medium bowl and set aside. I just use my stand mixer for this, then set them aside in a bowl.\nIn a large measuring cup, add the soy milk, apple cider vinegar and ground flaxseeds. Whisk to combine, then set aside.\nIn medium bowl, add the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and salt and whisk to combine. Set aside.\nIn a stand mixer with the paddle attachment or in a large bowl using a handheld mixer, beat the vegan butter for about a minute until creamy. Now add the sugars and beat for 2 minutes until combined. Add the vanilla and mashed bananas and mix in.\nAlternate adding the milk/flaxseed mixture and the dry ingredients, in about three additions, mixing until each addition is just incorporated.\u00c2\u00a0 Do not over mix.\nTransfer the cake batter to the pan and bake for 45-50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.\nRemove from oven and let cool in a wire rack. Let it cool completely before frosting. I usually stick it in the refrigerator to speed this up.", {"entities": [[35, 45, "QUANTITY"], [46, 52, "INGREDIENT"], [54, 60, "QUANTITY"], [61, 81, "INGREDIENT"], [82, 93, "QUANTITY"], [94, 113, "INGREDIENT"], [114, 127, "QUANTITY"], [128, 144, "INGREDIENT"], [145, 151, "QUANTITY"], [152, 169, "INGREDIENT"], [170, 181, "QUANTITY"], [182, 195, "INGREDIENT"], [196, 206, "QUANTITY"], [207, 218, "INGREDIENT"], [219, 231, "QUANTITY"], [232, 247, "INGREDIENT"], [248, 260, "QUANTITY"], [261, 265, "INGREDIENT"], [266, 273, "QUANTITY"], [274, 296, "INGREDIENT"], [297, 302, "QUANTITY"], [303, 319, "INGREDIENT"], [320, 327, "QUANTITY"], [328, 347, "INGREDIENT"], [348, 359, "QUANTITY"], [360, 380, "INGREDIENT"], [381, 389, "QUANTITY"], [390, 408, "INGREDIENT"], [409, 416, "QUANTITY"], [417, 439, "INGREDIENT"], [440, 446, "QUANTITY"], [447, 461, "INGREDIENT"], [462, 472, "QUANTITY"], [473, 493, "INGREDIENT"], [494, 519, "INGREDIENT"], [736, 739, "QUANTITY"], [741, 744, "PROCESS"], [749, 757, "INGREDIENT"], [759, 778, "INGREDIENT"], [783, 799, "INGREDIENT"], [851, 854, "PROCESS"], [859, 864, "INGREDIENT"], [866, 879, "INGREDIENT"], [881, 892, "INGREDIENT"], [894, 902, "INGREDIENT"], [907, 911, "INGREDIENT"], [916, 921, "PROCESS"], [1041, 1053, "INGREDIENT"], [1091, 1094, "PROCESS"], [1153, 1160, "INGREDIENT"], [1165, 1179, "INGREDIENT"], [1184, 1187, "PROCESS"], [1202, 1208, "PROCESS"], [1213, 1217, "INGREDIENT"], [1286, 1292, "PROCESS"], [1299, 1303, "INGREDIENT"], [1349, 1352, "PROCESS"], [1394, 1398, "PROCESS"]]}]
