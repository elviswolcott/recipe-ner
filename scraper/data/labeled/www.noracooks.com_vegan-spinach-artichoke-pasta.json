["Ingredients:\n16 ounces penne pasta\n1 1/2 cups raw cashews, soaked\n1 1/2 cups unsweetened cashew, soy or almond milk\n1/4 cup  nutritional yeast\n2 tablespoons lemon juice\n1 1/2 teaspoons salt\n4 cups loosely packed baby spinach\n(2) 14-ounce cans artichokes, water packed, drained well\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n1 small onion, chopped\n4 cloves garlic, minced\n\nInstructions:\nCook the pasta in boiling water according to package instructions, then drain and set aside. Save some (about a cup) of the pasta water for adding back in later.\nSoak the cashews in boiling hot water for 5 minutes, then drain and add to a high powered blender, along with the milk, nutritional yeast, lemon juice and salt. Blend until very smooth.\nTo the blender, add the spinach and artichokes, and pulse a few times, using the tamper, being careful not to blend too much as you want to leave a good amount of texture. Set aside.\nIn the same pot you used to cook the pasta, add a tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat, then add the onion and garlic and saut\u00c3\u00a9 for 3-4 minutes until translucent.\nNow add the creamy mixture from the blender, and stir, cooking for 2-3 minutes until it thickens somewhat. Be careful not to burn the bottom.\nNow add the cooked pasta, and stir to mix. I usually add some of the water, 1/2 cup or more, if it&#039;s too thick. Serve immediately and enjoy!", {"entities": [[13, 22, "QUANTITY"], [23, 34, "INGREDIENT"], [35, 45, "QUANTITY"], [46, 65, "INGREDIENT"], [66, 76, "QUANTITY"], [77, 115, "INGREDIENT"], [116, 123, "QUANTITY"], [125, 142, "INGREDIENT"], [143, 156, "QUANTITY"], [157, 168, "INGREDIENT"], [169, 184, "QUANTITY"], [185, 189, "INGREDIENT"], [190, 196, "QUANTITY"], [197, 224, "INGREDIENT"], [255, 260, "INGREDIENT"], [261, 267, "INGREDIENT"], [282, 294, "QUANTITY"], [295, 304, "INGREDIENT"], [313, 318, "INGREDIENT"], [320, 327, "INGREDIENT"], [330, 336, "INGREDIENT"], [337, 343, "INGREDIENT"], [345, 351, "INGREDIENT"], [376, 381, "INGREDIENT"], [385, 398, "INGREDIENT"], [479, 482, "QUANTITY"], [491, 502, "INGREDIENT"], [507, 513, "PROCESS"], [538, 545, "INGREDIENT"], [549, 566, "INGREDIENT"], [597, 600, "PROCESS"], [643, 647, "INGREDIENT"], [649, 666, "INGREDIENT"], [668, 679, "INGREDIENT"], [684, 689, "INGREDIENT"], [731, 734, "PROCESS"], [739, 746, "INGREDIENT"], [926, 930, "PROCESS"], [935, 940, "INGREDIENT"], [942, 945, "PROCESS"], [962, 971, "INGREDIENT"], [995, 998, "PROCESS"], [1003, 1008, "INGREDIENT"], [1013, 1019, "INGREDIENT"], [1070, 1073, "PROCESS"], [1115, 1119, "PROCESS"], [1121, 1128, "PROCESS"], [1212, 1215, "PROCESS"], [1220, 1232, "INGREDIENT"], [1238, 1242, "PROCESS"], [1246, 1249, "PROCESS"], [1261, 1264, "PROCESS"], [1277, 1282, "INGREDIENT"], [1284, 1291, "QUANTITY"], [1292, 1299, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
