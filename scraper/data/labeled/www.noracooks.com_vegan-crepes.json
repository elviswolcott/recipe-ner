["Ingredients:\n1 1/2 cups all purpose flour\n1 tablespoon cornstarch\n1 tablespoon granulated sugar\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n2 tablespoons neutral flavored oil, such as canola, melted refined coconut, or avocado oil\n1 cup unsweetened soy milk\n1 cup sparkling water OR regular water\n2-4 tablespoons vegan butter, for the pan\n2-3 lemons sliced, for serving\n2-4 tablespoons powdered sugar\nberries, optional for serving\nmaple syrup, for serving\n\nInstructions:\nIn a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cornstarch, sugar and salt. Now add the oil, non-dairy milk and sparkling water OR regular water (sparkling water makes them even lighter, but is not necessary). Whisk well until smooth and well combined.\nHeat a medium sized, non-stick pan to medium heat. Once hot, add a tablespoon or two of vegan butter to the pan. Once melted, add about 1/3 cup of the batter to the pan. Immediately pick up the pan and rotate it to move the batter into a thin circle.\nCook until the top looks fairly dry, about 2 minutes. Using a spatula, carefully flip the crepe over and cook for 30 seconds on the other side. Remove from pan and repeat with the rest of the batter.\nServe: My favorite way to serve crepes is by squirting a little lemon juice on the crepe, add some powdered sugar, and roll or fold. Dust with more powdered sugar and serve with fresh berries and maple syrup.", {"entities": [[13, 23, "QUANTITY"], [24, 41, "INGREDIENT"], [42, 54, "QUANTITY"], [55, 65, "INGREDIENT"], [66, 78, "QUANTITY"], [79, 95, "INGREDIENT"], [96, 108, "QUANTITY"], [109, 113, "INGREDIENT"], [114, 127, "QUANTITY"], [128, 204, "INGREDIENT"], [205, 210, "QUANTITY"], [211, 231, "INGREDIENT"], [232, 237, "QUANTITY"], [238, 270, "INGREDIENT"], [273, 286, "QUANTITY"], [287, 312, "INGREDIENT"], [346, 359, "QUANTITY"], [360, 374, "INGREDIENT"], [405, 416, "INGREDIENT"], [462, 467, "PROCESS"], [481, 486, "INGREDIENT"], [488, 498, "INGREDIENT"], [500, 505, "INGREDIENT"], [510, 515, "INGREDIENT"], [520, 523, "PROCESS"], [528, 531, "INGREDIENT"], [533, 547, "INGREDIENT"], [552, 584, "INGREDIENT"], [586, 601, "INGREDIENT"], [754, 757, "PROCESS"], [781, 793, "INGREDIENT"], [819, 822, "PROCESS"], [829, 836, "QUANTITY"], [931, 935, "PROCESS"], [1049, 1053, "PROCESS"], [1208, 1219, "INGREDIENT"], [1234, 1237, "PROCESS"], [1243, 1257, "INGREDIENT"], [1292, 1306, "INGREDIENT"], [1322, 1327, "INGREDIENT"], [1340, 1351, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
