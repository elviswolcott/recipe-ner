["Ingredients:\n3/4 cup vegan butter\ntwo 10-ounce bags vegan marshmallows*\n1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n8 cups rice krispie cereal*\n\nInstructions:\nLine a 9 x 13 inch baking pan with parchment paper and lightly spray with oil. Set aside.\nIn a large pot, melt the vegan butter. Now add the vegan marshmallows and stir, until the marshmallows are melted. They won&#x27;t melt as well as regular marshmallows, but they should still melt and turn into sort of a big blob.\nRemove the pan from heat and stir in the vanilla. Now fold in the cereal using a large spoon or spatula. There will be chunks of marshmallows and that&#x27;s okay, just try to coat all the cereal.\nTransfer to the prepared pan and press down evenly either with your hands or a spatula. You can lightly grease the spatula if it sticks.\nAllow the treats to cool for 1 hour. Remove from the pan, using the parchment paper, then cut into squares and serve.
