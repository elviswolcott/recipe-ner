["Ingredients:\n15-ounce can chickpeas, drained and rinsed (1 1/2 cups)\n1/4 cup chopped small red onion (about 1/2 small red onion)\n2 cloves garlic, minced\n1/2 teaspoon ground cumin\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n2 tablespoons tahini or peanut butter\n1/3 cup breadcrumbs\n1/2 cup chopped cilantro (may also use parsley)\n\nInstructions:\nIn a large bowl, add the drained and rinsed chickpeas. Use a potato masher or fork to mash them until no whole beans remain.\nAdd the chopped red onion, garlic, cumin, salt, tahini, breadcrumbs and cilantro to the chickpeas, and stir with a large spoon until well combined.\nForm into burger shapes, about 3-4 inches wide and 1/2 inch thick.\nIn a large pan, heat 1/4 cup of oil over medium heat. Carefully place the patties on the pan, and fry for about 4 minutes, then flip and cook for another 3-4 minutes until golden brown. Alternatively, you could bake the burgers at 350 degrees for 15 minutes, then flip and bake for 15 more minutes.\nRemove from the pan and place on a paper towel lined plate.\nServe immediately on buns with toppings of choice. I went with vegan mayo, arugula, tomatoes and red onion slices.
