["Ingredients:\n1/2 cup almond flour\n1/2 cup flour (, I use unbleached white. Use oat flour or gluten-free blend to make gluten-free)\n1/4 tsp salt\n1/3 tsp cinnamon\n3.5 tbsp coconut sugar ( or use any fine grain sugar of choice)\n2.5 to 3 tbsp oil (, organic safflower or other neutral)\n1 1/4 cup sweet potato puree (, or use pure pumpkin puree)\n1/4 cup maple syrup\n5 tsp starch (, cornstarch or arrowroot starch)\n1 tsp pumpkin pie spice (, or use 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ground ginger, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, a pinch of cloves)\n1/2 tsp vanilla extract\n1/8 tsp salt\n1 tbsp oil (, organic safflower or other neutral)\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a loaf pan with parchment such that the parchment strip is hanging over the edge (see pics). Make the Crust: Add all the ingredients except oil in a bowl and mix well. Add 2 tbsp of oil and mix in with a spoon or your hand. Add more oil a tsp at a time to mix in until the crust starts to stick to make fat crumbs.&nbsp;\nTransfer mixture to the loaf pan (a stoneware or glass pan works better to keep the crust more shortbread like and reduce overbrowning). Press it down to form a well packed and even crust. Bake for 8 to 10 mins.\nMix everything under the sweet potato layer until well combined. Pour over the baked crust. Bake for 35 to 45 minutes until the top is well set.&nbsp;\nLet it cool for 15 minutes, then gently remove from the pan. Chill for atleast an hour before slicing. Longer chilling time (a few hours) makes for a better set top and much more spiced and buttery flavor profile. Serve as is or with a dollop of vegan vanilla ice cream or whipped coconut cream and a dusting of pumpkin pie spice.", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 33, "INGREDIENT"], [34, 41, "QUANTITY"], [42, 47, "INGREDIENT"], [79, 88, "INGREDIENT"], [131, 138, "QUANTITY"], [139, 143, "INGREDIENT"], [144, 151, "QUANTITY"], [152, 160, "INGREDIENT"], [170, 183, "INGREDIENT"], [208, 213, "INGREDIENT"], [232, 238, "QUANTITY"], [239, 242, "INGREDIENT"], [254, 263, "INGREDIENT"], [282, 291, "QUANTITY"], [292, 310, "INGREDIENT"], [326, 339, "INGREDIENT"], [341, 348, "QUANTITY"], [349, 360, "INGREDIENT"], [361, 366, "QUANTITY"], [367, 373, "INGREDIENT"], [377, 407, "INGREDIENT"], [409, 414, "QUANTITY"], [415, 432, "INGREDIENT"], [443, 450, "QUANTITY"], [451, 459, "INGREDIENT"], [461, 468, "QUANTITY"], [469, 482, "INGREDIENT"], [484, 491, "QUANTITY"], [492, 498, "INGREDIENT"], [511, 517, "INGREDIENT"], [519, 526, "QUANTITY"], [527, 542, "INGREDIENT"], [543, 550, "QUANTITY"], [551, 555, "INGREDIENT"], [556, 562, "QUANTITY"], [563, 566, "INGREDIENT"], [578, 587, "INGREDIENT"], [801, 804, "INGREDIENT"], [819, 822, "PROCESS"], [833, 839, "QUANTITY"], [840, 846, "INGREDIENT"], [851, 854, "PROCESS"], [894, 897, "INGREDIENT"], [917, 920, "PROCESS"], [1148, 1154, "INGREDIENT"], [1219, 1231, "INGREDIENT"], [1273, 1278, "PROCESS"], [1591, 1614, "INGREDIENT"], [1618, 1639, "INGREDIENT"], [1657, 1674, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
