["Ingredients:\n8 ounces vegan chocolate chips or chopped vegan chocolate bars (about 1 cup)\n1 cup full fat coconut milk or cream\n\nInstructions:\nAdd chocolate chips to a medium sized bowl. If using chocolate bars, chop and place in the bowl.\nScoop the thick white part from the can of coconut if it&#039;s naturally separated. Try to use mostly the thick white coconut cream, but some of the clearer liquid is fine. A can of coconut cream works best.\nPut the coconut milk in a microwave safe bowl or measuring cup and heat in the microwave for about 1 minute, watching to make sure it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bubble over.\nPour the warm cream over the chocolate chips and let sit for 2-3 minutes. Don&#039;t stir yet.\nAfter 2-3 minutes, whisk the chocolate/melted coconut milk until smooth. To use as a frosting let it cool completely first, it will thicken up and become spreadable. To make it runnier, you can warm it in the microwave for 30 seconds to 1 minute before using, such as for pancakes, cupcakes, or as a drizzle on a cake.", {"entities": [[13, 21, "QUANTITY"], [22, 75, "INGREDIENT"], [83, 88, "QUANTITY"], [90, 95, "QUANTITY"], [96, 126, "INGREDIENT"], [146, 161, "INGREDIENT"], [195, 204, "INGREDIENT"], [220, 225, "PROCESS"], [275, 278, "INGREDIENT"], [282, 289, "INGREDIENT"], [358, 371, "INGREDIENT"], [415, 418, "INGREDIENT"], [419, 435, "INGREDIENT"], [456, 468, "INGREDIENT"], [507, 510, "QUANTITY"], [634, 649, "INGREDIENT"], [690, 694, "PROCESS"], [719, 724, "PROCESS"], [729, 738, "INGREDIENT"], [746, 758, "INGREDIENT"], [890, 893, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
