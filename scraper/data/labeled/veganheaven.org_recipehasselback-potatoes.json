["Ingredients:\n12  fist-sized potatoes (for example Russet or Idaho potatoes (or other starchy potatoes))\n5 tablespoons olive oil\n5  cloves of garlic\n3  sprigs of rosemary\nsea salt\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 425 F. Place the potatoes on a cutting board. With a sharp knife carefully cut the potatoes into 1/4 inch thick slices. The slices should still stay connected at the bottom, so don&#039;t cut all the way through the potato. Leave a solid base of at least 1/2 inch at the bottom of the potato. Cut the garlic into slices.\u00c2\u00a0\nLine a baking tray with parchment paper. Place the potatoes on the baking tray. Brush them with half of the olive oil (make sure to get some oil in between the slices), and place some rosemary leaves, and the garlic slices in between each cut of the potatoes. Sprinkle each potato generously with sea salt. Bake for 30 minutes.\u00c2\u00a0\nRemove the potatoes from the oven and brush them with the remaining olive oil. If some of the garlic slices are too dark, discard them. Bake for another 30 minutes.\u00c2\u00a0\nRemove from the oven and serve immediately, either as a side dish or with sour cream and a big green salad.\u00c2\u00a0", {"entities": [[28, 36, "INGREDIENT"], [66, 74, "INGREDIENT"], [93, 101, "INGREDIENT"], [104, 117, "QUANTITY"], [118, 127, "INGREDIENT"], [131, 137, "INGREDIENT"], [141, 147, "INGREDIENT"], [161, 169, "INGREDIENT"], [170, 178, "INGREDIENT"], [231, 239, "INGREDIENT"], [297, 305, "INGREDIENT"], [430, 436, "INGREDIENT"], [499, 505, "INGREDIENT"], [515, 521, "INGREDIENT"], [544, 550, "PROCESS"], [588, 596, "INGREDIENT"], [604, 610, "PROCESS"], [645, 654, "INGREDIENT"], [678, 681, "INGREDIENT"], [710, 715, "PROCESS"], [721, 729, "INGREDIENT"], [746, 752, "INGREDIENT"], [771, 775, "INGREDIENT"], [787, 795, "INGREDIENT"], [806, 810, "INGREDIENT"], [811, 817, "INGREDIENT"], [834, 842, "INGREDIENT"], [878, 886, "INGREDIENT"], [935, 944, "INGREDIENT"], [961, 967, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
