["Ingredients:\n1 1/2 cups all purpose flour\n1/4 cup granulated sugar\n2 teaspoons baking powder\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n2 teaspoons ground cinnamon\n1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce\n1/2 cup soy milk\n2 large apples (granny smith, honey crisp or other crisp variety)\nvegetable oil, for frying*\n3 cups powdered sugar\n1/3 cup soy milk\n1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n\nInstructions:\nIn a large bowl, add the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and cinnamon and stir to combine.\nNow add the applesauce and soy milk to the bowl with the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Do not over mix. Fold in the diced apples.\nHeat 2 inches of oil in a large, heavy skillet or pot to about 375 degrees (you do need a thermometer).\u00c2\u00a0Scoop 1/3 cup of the apple fritter batter and place in the hot oil, spreading it down to flatten quite a bit. You can also first flatten them on a floured surface, then transfer carefully to the pot for frying.\nCook on one side for about 2-3 minutes until golden brown, then flip with tongs and cook another 1-2 minutes until browned.\nPlace the cooked fritters on a cooling rack with a pan or parchment paper underneath to catch any oil drippings, as well as to catch glaze later.\nContinue with all the batter until you have used it all, then turn off the heat.\nMake the glaze: Whisk the glaze ingredients together in a small-medium sized bowl until smooth, then dunk each fritter into it. Place back on rack to harden and drip. Wait a few minutes if possible for the glaze to harden before enjoying.", {"entities": [[13, 23, "QUANTITY"], [24, 41, "INGREDIENT"], [42, 49, "QUANTITY"], [50, 66, "INGREDIENT"], [67, 78, "QUANTITY"], [79, 92, "INGREDIENT"], [93, 105, "QUANTITY"], [106, 110, "INGREDIENT"], [111, 122, "QUANTITY"], [123, 138, "INGREDIENT"], [139, 146, "QUANTITY"], [147, 169, "INGREDIENT"], [170, 177, "QUANTITY"], [178, 186, "INGREDIENT"], [217, 222, "INGREDIENT"], [253, 278, "INGREDIENT"], [280, 286, "QUANTITY"], [287, 301, "INGREDIENT"], [302, 309, "QUANTITY"], [310, 318, "INGREDIENT"], [319, 331, "QUANTITY"], [332, 352, "INGREDIENT"], [385, 388, "PROCESS"], [393, 398, "INGREDIENT"], [400, 405, "INGREDIENT"], [407, 420, "INGREDIENT"], [422, 426, "INGREDIENT"], [431, 439, "INGREDIENT"], [444, 448, "PROCESS"], [465, 468, "PROCESS"], [473, 483, "INGREDIENT"], [488, 496, "INGREDIENT"], [538, 541, "PROCESS"], [575, 578, "PROCESS"], [592, 597, "INGREDIENT"], [620, 626, "INGREDIENT"], [717, 724, "QUANTITY"], [757, 762, "PROCESS"], [774, 777, "INGREDIENT"], [825, 828, "INGREDIENT"], [914, 920, "PROCESS"], [1006, 1010, "PROCESS"], [1056, 1062, "PROCESS"], [1144, 1147, "INGREDIENT"], [1379, 1383, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
