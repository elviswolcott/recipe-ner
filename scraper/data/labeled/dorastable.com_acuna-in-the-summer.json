["Ingredients:\n3  Plum tomatoes, (small)\n1  Beefsteak tomato\n1/4  White onion\n3 cloves Garlic, unpeeled\n1  Poblano Pepper\n1  Anaheim pepper\n1  Jalape\u00c3\u00b1o\n2  Serrano Peppers\n1/2 tsp. Salt (plus more as needed)\n1/4  cup Chopped cilantro\n\nInstructions:\nCut off the stems of the peppers and the tops of the tomatoes.&nbsp;\nHeat a griddle or cast iron pan to high heat. Place all of the peppers, tomatoes, onion, and garlic on the griddle until they become soft and slightly blackened, about 7-10 min. (See note)\nFlip peppers, tomatoes, onion, and garlic and continue to char for another 5- 7 minutes. (The garlic will be done before the peppers and onions are finished cooking. Simply remove them from the griddle.)\nRemove ingredients from griddle and set aside. Peel most of the dark burnt skin off of the tomatoes and chiles. You can leave a little bit for the smoky flavor. Peel the garlic.&nbsp;\nTo start grinding ingredients in molcajete, place 1/2 tsp. of salt and the garlic in the molcajete. Grind down until a thick paste has been made.&nbsp;\nAdd the onion and grind down to a paste. Add the peppers and grind down one by one until you have the desired consistency. Add the tomatoes one by one and keep grinding. Chop cilantro and add it to the molcajete. Season to taste and serve.\u00c2\u00a0\nIf you do not have a molcajete you can use a blender or food processor. Simply place all the cooked ingredients in the machine and pulse until the desired consistency is reached. I prefer it on the chunky side.", {"entities": [[21, 29, "INGREDIENT"], [52, 58, "INGREDIENT"], [64, 75, "INGREDIENT"], [78, 84, "INGREDIENT"], [131, 137, "INGREDIENT"], [170, 177, "QUANTITY"], [179, 183, "INGREDIENT"], [206, 214, "QUANTITY"], [215, 231, "INGREDIENT"], [388, 396, "INGREDIENT"], [398, 403, "INGREDIENT"], [409, 415, "INGREDIENT"], [519, 527, "INGREDIENT"], [529, 534, "INGREDIENT"], [540, 546, "INGREDIENT"], [599, 605, "INGREDIENT"], [642, 648, "INGREDIENT"], [662, 669, "PROCESS"], [800, 808, "INGREDIENT"], [825, 828, "INGREDIENT"], [937, 942, "PROCESS"], [943, 950, "QUANTITY"], [952, 959, "INGREDIENT"], [968, 974, "INGREDIENT"], [1018, 1023, "INGREDIENT"], [1053, 1058, "INGREDIENT"], [1079, 1084, "INGREDIENT"], [1176, 1184, "INGREDIENT"], [1220, 1228, "INGREDIENT"], [1233, 1236, "PROCESS"], [1322, 1325, "INGREDIENT"], [1366, 1371, "PROCESS"], [1380, 1386, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
