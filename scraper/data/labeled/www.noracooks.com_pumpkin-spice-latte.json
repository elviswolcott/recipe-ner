["Ingredients:\n2 tablespoons pure maple syrup\n2 tablespoons pumpkin puree\n1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice mix\n1/2 cup unsweetened non-dairy milk of choice (almond, soy, coconut, cashew)\n1/2 cup strong brewed coffee, or 1-2 shots of espresso\nVegan Whipped Cream\n\nInstructions:\nIn a small pot over medium heat, add the maple syrup and pumpkin puree. Stir, then add the pumpkin pie spice mix and the non-dairy milk. Warm, but do not bring to a boil.\nOnce warm, turn off the heat and add the coffee (or espresso shots) and stir. Taste for sweetness: Add more maple syrup for a sweeter drink; I found 2 tablespoons to be just right.\nPour into a mug and top with vegan whipped cream. Sprinkle a little more pumpkin pie spice mix on top if desired. Enjoy!", {"entities": [[13, 26, "QUANTITY"], [27, 43, "INGREDIENT"], [44, 57, "QUANTITY"], [58, 71, "INGREDIENT"], [72, 84, "QUANTITY"], [85, 106, "INGREDIENT"], [107, 114, "QUANTITY"], [115, 151, "INGREDIENT"], [166, 174, "INGREDIENT"], [183, 190, "QUANTITY"], [191, 237, "INGREDIENT"], [306, 309, "PROCESS"], [314, 325, "INGREDIENT"], [330, 343, "INGREDIENT"], [356, 359, "PROCESS"], [364, 385, "INGREDIENT"], [394, 408, "INGREDIENT"], [438, 442, "PROCESS"], [477, 480, "PROCESS"], [516, 520, "PROCESS"], [552, 563, "INGREDIENT"], [593, 606, "QUANTITY"], [698, 719, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
