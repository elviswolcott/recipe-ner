Now add the almond milk and vanilla to the bowl and mix until just combined.\nHeat waffle iron according to instructions. Once the waffle iron is ready, cook the waffles according to the manufacturer instructions. Spray your waffle iron well with oil to prevent sticking, and allow the waffle to cook fully before opening the waffle maker. If you try to remove it too soon, it may stick.\nServe with fresh fruit, vegan butter and maple syrup as desired.\nTo freeze: Allow the waffles to cool completely. Place in a large freezer bag or container in stacks and freeze. When ready to serve, place waffle either in the toaster or oven until warmed through.\u00c2\u00a0", {"entities": [[13, 19, "QUANTITY"], [20, 41, "INGREDIENT"], [63, 68, "INGREDIENT"], [70, 76, "QUANTITY"], [77, 89, "INGREDIENT"], [90, 102, "QUANTITY"], [103, 116, "INGREDIENT"], [117, 130, "QUANTITY"], [131, 141, "INGREDIENT"], [142, 155, "QUANTITY"], [156, 172, "INGREDIENT"], [176, 187, "INGREDIENT"], [203, 215, "QUANTITY"], [216, 220, "INGREDIENT"], [221, 227, "QUANTITY"], [228, 239, "INGREDIENT"], [245, 253, "INGREDIENT"], [255, 265, "QUANTITY"], [266, 286, "INGREDIENT"], [319, 322, "PROCESS"], [364, 367, "PROCESS"], [372, 383, "INGREDIENT"], [388, 395, "INGREDIENT"], [412, 415, "PROCESS"], [512, 516, "PROCESS"], [606, 609, "INGREDIENT"], [655, 659, "PROCESS"], [758, 763, "INGREDIENT"], [771, 783, "INGREDIENT"], [788, 799, "INGREDIENT"], [946, 951, "PROCESS"]]}]
