["Ingredients:\n3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons flour (I use all-purpose. You can also use oat flour to make it gluten-free.)\n3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons, almond flour\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n2 teaspoons  flaxseed meal  (mixed with 2 tablespoons of water)\n1/2 teaspoon oregano\n1/4 teaspoon thyme (these herbs are optional)\n4-5 tablespoons non-dairy milk\n14 ounces  firm tofu (pressed for 5 mins)\n1 tablespoon flour  (or use chickpea flour)\n1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n1/2 teaspoon Indian Sulfur salt or Kala Namak\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon turmeric\n1/4 teaspoon baking powder\n1/2 teaspoon onion powder\n1-2 tablespoons nutritional yeast\n2 tablespoons  water\n1 teaspoon oil (or use 2-3 tbsp broth to saut\u00c3\u00a9 to make Oilfree )\n3  garlic cloves minced\n3/4 cup chopped leeks\n1 cup thinly sliced mushrooms\n1/4 tsp salt\n3/4 cup frozen spinach thawed and squeezed lightly\n\nInstructions:\nMake the Pie crust:\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0In a bowl or food processor, add the flour, almond flour, salt, herbs, and pulse or mix. Add in the flax egg and mix in.\nThen add in 4 tablespoons of non-dairy milk and mix well or process 10-15 seconds\nIf the dough is somewhat dry, add in more non-dairy milk, 1 teaspoon at a time until you can make a dough which is somewhat sticky and crumbly, not necessarily all together, but sticks when you press.\nPress this dough into a greased 9 inch tart pan (or use a pie pan) . Use a fork to create holes in the dough. Then bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 c) for 13 minutes.\nMeanwhile for the filling:  heat up oil in the skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook for half a minute. Then add in the leeks, mushrooms, and salt and continue to cook until the mushrooms are golden.\nOnce the mushrooms are somewhat golden, add in the spinach. Mix in and continue until the spinach moisture is evaporated for 3-4 minutes. Cool this mixture for 10 mins\nMake the tofu egg mixture by adding all of the ingredients to a food processor with 2 tablespoons of water and processing it until the mixture is somewhat smooth.\nMix your mushroom leek filling in this mixture and then transfer it to the baked pie crust.\nEven it out. Top it with some cherry tomatoes or sun-dried tomatoes and bake for 30-35 minutes.\nOnce the center is set and not jiggly, the quiche is done. Take it out of the oven and let it sit for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 45, "INGREDIENT"], [70, 73, "INGREDIENT"], [83, 92, "INGREDIENT"], [118, 125, "QUANTITY"], [126, 158, "INGREDIENT"], [159, 171, "QUANTITY"], [172, 176, "INGREDIENT"], [177, 188, "QUANTITY"], [190, 203, "INGREDIENT"], [206, 211, "PROCESS"], [217, 230, "QUANTITY"], [231, 239, "INGREDIENT"], [241, 253, "QUANTITY"], [254, 261, "INGREDIENT"], [262, 274, "QUANTITY"], [275, 280, "INGREDIENT"], [288, 293, "INGREDIENT"], [310, 323, "QUANTITY"], [324, 338, "INGREDIENT"], [339, 348, "QUANTITY"], [350, 359, "INGREDIENT"], [361, 368, "PROCESS"], [381, 393, "QUANTITY"], [394, 399, "INGREDIENT"], [409, 423, "INGREDIENT"], [425, 437, "QUANTITY"], [438, 450, "INGREDIENT"], [451, 463, "QUANTITY"], [464, 496, "INGREDIENT"], [497, 509, "QUANTITY"], [510, 514, "INGREDIENT"], [515, 527, "QUANTITY"], [528, 536, "INGREDIENT"], [537, 549, "QUANTITY"], [550, 563, "INGREDIENT"], [564, 576, "QUANTITY"], [577, 589, "INGREDIENT"], [592, 605, "QUANTITY"], [606, 623, "INGREDIENT"], [624, 637, "QUANTITY"], [639, 644, "INGREDIENT"], [645, 655, "QUANTITY"], [656, 659, "INGREDIENT"], [670, 676, "QUANTITY"], [677, 682, "INGREDIENT"], [714, 720, "INGREDIENT"], [721, 727, "INGREDIENT"], [728, 734, "INGREDIENT"], [735, 742, "QUANTITY"], [743, 756, "INGREDIENT"], [757, 762, "QUANTITY"], [763, 786, "INGREDIENT"], [787, 794, "QUANTITY"], [795, 799, "INGREDIENT"], [800, 807, "QUANTITY"], [808, 850, "INGREDIENT"], [919, 922, "PROCESS"], [927, 932, "INGREDIENT"], [934, 946, "INGREDIENT"], [948, 952, "INGREDIENT"], [954, 959, "INGREDIENT"], [974, 977, "PROCESS"], [1003, 1006, "PROCESS"], [1016, 1019, "PROCESS"], [1023, 1036, "QUANTITY"], [1040, 1054, "INGREDIENT"], [1059, 1062, "PROCESS"], [1123, 1126, "PROCESS"], [1135, 1149, "INGREDIENT"], [1151, 1161, "QUANTITY"], [1182, 1185, "INGREDIENT"], [1287, 1292, "PROCESS"], [1409, 1413, "PROCESS"], [1500, 1503, "INGREDIENT"], [1545, 1551, "INGREDIENT"], [1556, 1560, "PROCESS"], [1585, 1588, "PROCESS"], [1603, 1612, "INGREDIENT"], [1618, 1622, "INGREDIENT"], [1639, 1643, "PROCESS"], [1654, 1663, "INGREDIENT"], [1685, 1694, "INGREDIENT"], [1716, 1719, "PROCESS"], [1727, 1734, "INGREDIENT"], [1766, 1773, "INGREDIENT"], [1853, 1857, "INGREDIENT"], [1873, 1879, "PROCESS"], [1928, 1941, "QUANTITY"], [1942, 1950, "INGREDIENT"], [2016, 2024, "INGREDIENT"], [2025, 2029, "INGREDIENT"], [2082, 2087, "PROCESS"], [2129, 2144, "INGREDIENT"], [2148, 2166, "INGREDIENT"], [2171, 2175, "PROCESS"]]}]
