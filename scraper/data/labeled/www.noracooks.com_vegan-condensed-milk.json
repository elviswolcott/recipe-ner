["Ingredients:\n13.5 ounce can coconut cream\n1/2 cup granulated sugar\n1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\npinch of salt (~1/8th teaspoon)\n\nInstructions:\nIn a small saucepan, combine the coconut cream, sugar, vanilla and salt over medium-high heat.\nWhisk well to combine and bring the mixture to a boil then quickly reduce the heat and simmer on low heat for 40-45 minutes, whisking every 5-10 minutes. The liquid should be reduced by about half when it&#39;s done. It will still be fairly thin at first, but as it cools it will thicken up nicely.\nRemove from heat and transfer to a glass container with a lid. Place in the refrigerator to chill for at least an hour before using.\nLeftover vegan condensed milk can be stored in a covered container for up to 2 weeks. To freeze, store in a jar with a tight fitting lid. When ready to use, thaw in the refrigerator overnight then add to a bowl and whisk until smooth (or throw it in a blender until smooth).", {"entities": [[24, 41, "INGREDIENT"], [42, 49, "QUANTITY"], [50, 66, "INGREDIENT"], [67, 79, "QUANTITY"], [80, 100, "INGREDIENT"], [101, 114, "INGREDIENT"], [181, 194, "INGREDIENT"], [196, 201, "INGREDIENT"], [203, 210, "INGREDIENT"], [215, 219, "INGREDIENT"], [292, 296, "PROCESS"], [484, 488, "PROCESS"], [684, 704, "INGREDIENT"], [705, 708, "INGREDIENT"], [872, 875, "PROCESS"], [890, 895, "PROCESS"]]}]
