Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F / 180c.\nAdd water, blueberries and sugars to a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil. Simmer until all the blueberries break apart and the mixture starts to thicken (about 5 to 6 mins). You can use a spatula to mash the berries so they cook through.\nTake off heat and Cool the mixture for a minute or so. Add the flax meal and chocolate and mix until the chocolate melt. Add the oil and vanilla and mix to combine. Let the mixture cool further to until warm to touch.*\nMeanwhile, mix the flours, cocoa, baking soda and salt in a bowl until well combined. Add the chocolate chips and blueberries and mix.\nAdd the dry to the wet and mix until just about combined. Drop the thick batter into the prepared brownie pan. Press the batter into the pan using a spatula or oiled hands. Press in 2 tbsp or more of chocolate chips or slivered almonds on top.\nBake for 20 to 22 minutes. Check with a toothpick an inch from the edge. the center might be liquidy but the toothpick from the edge should come out clean or not liquid.\nCool in the pan for 10 minutes, then remove from the pan and cool on the cooling rack for another 10 minutes before slicing.Serve warm with vegan ice cream of choice", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 26, "INGREDIENT"], [27, 34, "QUANTITY"], [35, 46, "INGREDIENT"], [47, 54, "QUANTITY"], [55, 68, "INGREDIENT"], [74, 85, "INGREDIENT"], [87, 94, "QUANTITY"], [95, 100, "INGREDIENT"], [101, 107, "QUANTITY"], [108, 122, "INGREDIENT"], [141, 148, "QUANTITY"], [149, 180, "INGREDIENT"], [186, 218, "INGREDIENT"], [234, 240, "QUANTITY"], [241, 244, "INGREDIENT"], [245, 250, "QUANTITY"], [251, 266, "INGREDIENT"], [267, 272, "QUANTITY"], [273, 278, "INGREDIENT"], [309, 316, "QUANTITY"], [317, 329, "INGREDIENT"], [330, 337, "QUANTITY"], [338, 350, "INGREDIENT"], [351, 358, "QUANTITY"], [359, 363, "INGREDIENT"], [364, 371, "QUANTITY"], [372, 383, "INGREDIENT"], [384, 391, "QUANTITY"], [392, 413, "INGREDIENT"], [414, 421, "QUANTITY"], [422, 433, "INGREDIENT"], [558, 563, "INGREDIENT"], [565, 576, "INGREDIENT"], [631, 635, "PROCESS"], [658, 669, "INGREDIENT"], [741, 744, "INGREDIENT"], [787, 791, "PROCESS"], [849, 854, "INGREDIENT"], [864, 873, "INGREDIENT"], [878, 887, "INGREDIENT"], [892, 895, "PROCESS"], [906, 915, "INGREDIENT"], [930, 933, "INGREDIENT"], [938, 945, "INGREDIENT"], [950, 953, "PROCESS"], [1031, 1034, "PROCESS"], [1047, 1052, "INGREDIENT"], [1054, 1065, "INGREDIENT"], [1070, 1074, "INGREDIENT"], [1114, 1129, "INGREDIENT"], [1134, 1145, "INGREDIENT"], [1150, 1153, "PROCESS"], [1182, 1185, "PROCESS"], [1337, 1343, "QUANTITY"], [1344, 1351, "INGREDIENT"], [1355, 1370, "INGREDIENT"], [1383, 1390, "INGREDIENT"], [1715, 1718, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
