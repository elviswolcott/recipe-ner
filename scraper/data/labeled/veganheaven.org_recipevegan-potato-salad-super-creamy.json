["Ingredients:\n35 oz waxy potatoes\n2 tablespoons white wine vinegar\n15  dill pickles, diced\n4 stalks of celery, diced\n1 small red onion, finely chopped\n2  green onions, cut into rings\n1/2 cup chopped parsley\n1/2 cup vegan mayonnaise\n2 teaspoons Dijon mustard\nsalt\npepper\n\nInstructions:\nFirst, peel the potatoes. I usually use all-purpose potatoes for my potato salad as they work for most potato dishes. Any kind of waxy potatoes work as well or actually even better. Just make sure not to use starchy potatoes.&nbsp;\nThen, dice the potatoes into medium-sized pieces.\nPlace the diced potatoes in a saucepan. Cover them with cold water and bring to boil. When the water is boiling, add one teaspoon of salt and turn the heat to medium. Cook for about 8 minutes. Check them regularly, you want them to be fork-tender. Make sure they're not too soft.\nDrain the potatoes and put them back in the pot. Add two tablespoons of white wine vinegar and let them cool down for about 25 minutes.\nWhile the potatoes are cooking, chop up the celery, the dill pickles, the red onions, the parsley, and the green onions. Put all ingredients (including the cooked potatoes) in a large bowl and stir in the vegan mayonnaise and the mustard. Season with salt and pepper.", {"entities": [[13, 18, "QUANTITY"], [19, 32, "INGREDIENT"], [33, 46, "QUANTITY"], [47, 65, "INGREDIENT"], [70, 74, "INGREDIENT"], [84, 89, "INGREDIENT"], [102, 108, "INGREDIENT"], [110, 115, "INGREDIENT"], [124, 133, "INGREDIENT"], [142, 149, "INGREDIENT"], [153, 165, "INGREDIENT"], [182, 189, "QUANTITY"], [190, 205, "INGREDIENT"], [206, 213, "QUANTITY"], [214, 230, "INGREDIENT"], [231, 242, "QUANTITY"], [243, 256, "INGREDIENT"], [257, 261, "INGREDIENT"], [262, 268, "INGREDIENT"], [300, 308, "INGREDIENT"], [336, 344, "INGREDIENT"], [352, 358, "INGREDIENT"], [387, 393, "INGREDIENT"], [414, 427, "INGREDIENT"], [531, 539, "INGREDIENT"], [576, 590, "INGREDIENT"], [622, 632, "INGREDIENT"], [646, 650, "PROCESS"], [661, 666, "INGREDIENT"], [670, 677, "PROCESS"], [679, 682, "PROCESS"], [696, 703, "INGREDIENT"], [856, 864, "INGREDIENT"], [918, 936, "INGREDIENT"], [992, 1000, "INGREDIENT"], [1005, 1012, "PROCESS"], [1026, 1032, "INGREDIENT"], [1038, 1042, "INGREDIENT"], [1060, 1066, "INGREDIENT"], [1072, 1079, "INGREDIENT"], [1089, 1101, "INGREDIENT"], [1138, 1144, "PROCESS"], [1145, 1153, "INGREDIENT"], [1175, 1179, "PROCESS"], [1187, 1203, "INGREDIENT"], [1212, 1219, "INGREDIENT"], [1233, 1237, "INGREDIENT"], [1242, 1248, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
