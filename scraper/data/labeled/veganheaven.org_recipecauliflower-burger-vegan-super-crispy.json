["Ingredients:\n1  medium-sized cauliflower\n1/2 cup vegan BBQ sauce\n1/2 cup all-purpose flour\n1/2 cup unsweetened plant-based milk (I usually use soy or almond milk)\n1 teaspoon smoked paprika powder\n1 teaspoon regular paprika powder\n1 teaspoon garlic powder\nsalt and pepper\n1 cup panko breadcrumbs\n2  burger buns\nlettuce\n2  tomatoes, sliced\n1/2  red onion, cut into rings\n2 tablespoons vegan mayonnaise\n\nInstructions:\nWith a sharp knife, cut the cauliflower into half.&nbsp; Slice in the center from top to bottom. This way you will have two cauliflower steaks. Leave the large stem at the bottom as it helps to hold together the \"steaks\". Use the remaining cauliflower for another recipe such as cauliflower wings. Or just freeze them for another time.\nIn a bowl, combine the flour, the plant-based milk, the water, paprika powder and garlic powder.&nbsp;Stir until well combined.&nbsp;Dip the cauliflower steaks into the batter, so they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re completely coated.\nPour the panko breadcrumbs on a plate.&nbsp;You could also use other breadcrumbs, but the cauliflower burger will get a lot crispier when you use panko breadcrumbs. So I highly recommend using panko breadcrumbs.\nTurn the cauliflower steaks in the panko breadcrumbs. They should be evenly covered.\nLine a baking sheet with parchment paper and carefully put the cauliflower steaks on top. Preheat the oven to 350 F and bake them for 25 minutes. Turn them halfway.\nAfter baking, carefully coat the cauliflower steaks with the BBQ sauce. I used a silicone basting brush for that.\nPut the cauliflower steaks back in the oven and bake again for 15 minutes (still at 350 F).\nServe the cauliflower steaks on burger buns together with vegan mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato and red onion slices. So yummy!", {"entities": [[29, 40, "INGREDIENT"], [41, 48, "QUANTITY"], [49, 64, "INGREDIENT"], [65, 72, "QUANTITY"], [73, 90, "INGREDIENT"], [91, 98, "QUANTITY"], [99, 127, "INGREDIENT"], [143, 161, "INGREDIENT"], [163, 173, "QUANTITY"], [174, 195, "INGREDIENT"], [196, 206, "QUANTITY"], [207, 229, "INGREDIENT"], [230, 240, "QUANTITY"], [241, 254, "INGREDIENT"], [255, 259, "INGREDIENT"], [264, 270, "INGREDIENT"], [271, 276, "QUANTITY"], [277, 294, "INGREDIENT"], [321, 329, "INGREDIENT"], [343, 352, "INGREDIENT"], [369, 382, "QUANTITY"], [383, 399, "INGREDIENT"], [443, 454, "INGREDIENT"], [539, 550, "INGREDIENT"], [655, 666, "INGREDIENT"], [694, 705, "INGREDIENT"], [774, 779, "INGREDIENT"], [785, 801, "INGREDIENT"], [807, 812, "INGREDIENT"], [814, 828, "INGREDIENT"], [833, 839, "INGREDIENT"], [892, 903, "INGREDIENT"], [969, 986, "INGREDIENT"], [1029, 1040, "INGREDIENT"], [1050, 1061, "INGREDIENT"], [1106, 1123, "INGREDIENT"], [1153, 1170, "INGREDIENT"], [1181, 1192, "INGREDIENT"], [1207, 1224, "INGREDIENT"], [1264, 1270, "PROCESS"], [1320, 1331, "INGREDIENT"], [1377, 1381, "PROCESS"], [1428, 1434, "PROCESS"], [1455, 1466, "INGREDIENT"], [1483, 1492, "INGREDIENT"], [1544, 1555, "INGREDIENT"], [1584, 1588, "PROCESS"], [1638, 1649, "INGREDIENT"], [1686, 1702, "INGREDIENT"], [1713, 1719, "INGREDIENT"], [1724, 1740, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
