In another pot, cook the vegan ramen noodles according to the instructions on the package. Set aside when done.\nIn the meantime, finely chop the onion, the garlic, and the ginger. Saut\u00c3\u00a9 in a large pan (you will need it again for the tofu later). Set aside.\nWhen the cooking time of the broth is over, carefully take out about half of the shiitake mushrooms with a ladle. Set aside for later. Let the soup cool down for a few minutes. Add the saut\u00c3\u00a9ed onion, garlic, and ginger to the soup as well as the miso paste. Then carefully transfer it into a high speed blender and process until fairly smooth. Transfer it back to the pot and simmer on low heat until you&#039;re done with the remaining steps.\nCut the cooked shiitake mushrooms into strips.\nCut the tofu into slices. Heat some oil (I used sesame oil) in the same pan that you used for the onions and pan-fry the tofu slices for about 2 minutes on each side on high heat. Add 1-2 teaspoons of soy sauce as well as some salt and pepper.\nGrate the carrots. Just before serving, add the cooked ramen noodles, the fresh spinach, the cooked tofu, the shiitake mushrooms, and the carrots to the ramen broth. Garnish with green onions and sesame and serve immediately.", {"entities": [[13, 19, "QUANTITY"], [20, 35, "INGREDIENT"], [40, 64, "INGREDIENT"], [65, 78, "QUANTITY"], [79, 98, "INGREDIENT"], [102, 107, "INGREDIENT"], [116, 123, "INGREDIENT"], [127, 133, "INGREDIENT"], [137, 143, "INGREDIENT"], [145, 151, "INGREDIENT"], [168, 196, "INGREDIENT"], [197, 207, "QUANTITY"], [208, 218, "INGREDIENT"], [229, 242, "INGREDIENT"], [243, 247, "QUANTITY"], [248, 257, "INGREDIENT"], [261, 268, "INGREDIENT"], [275, 288, "INGREDIENT"], [305, 317, "INGREDIENT"], [387, 402, "INGREDIENT"], [435, 439, "PROCESS"], [450, 463, "INGREDIENT"], [564, 569, "INGREDIENT"], [575, 581, "INGREDIENT"], [591, 597, "INGREDIENT"], [653, 657, "INGREDIENT"], [686, 693, "PROCESS"], [706, 711, "INGREDIENT"], [758, 776, "INGREDIENT"], [871, 876, "INGREDIENT"], [878, 884, "INGREDIENT"], [890, 896, "INGREDIENT"], [924, 934, "INGREDIENT"], [1130, 1136, "PROCESS"], [1137, 1155, "INGREDIENT"], [1177, 1181, "INGREDIENT"], [1205, 1208, "INGREDIENT"], [1217, 1227, "INGREDIENT"], [1267, 1273, "INGREDIENT"], [1282, 1285, "PROCESS"], [1290, 1294, "INGREDIENT"], [1325, 1329, "INGREDIENT"], [1355, 1366, "QUANTITY"], [1367, 1379, "INGREDIENT"], [1396, 1400, "INGREDIENT"], [1405, 1411, "INGREDIENT"], [1423, 1430, "INGREDIENT"], [1453, 1456, "PROCESS"], [1461, 1467, "PROCESS"], [1468, 1481, "INGREDIENT"], [1487, 1500, "INGREDIENT"], [1506, 1512, "PROCESS"], [1513, 1517, "INGREDIENT"], [1523, 1541, "INGREDIENT"], [1551, 1558, "INGREDIENT"], [1572, 1577, "INGREDIENT"], [1592, 1604, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
