["Ingredients:\n1 1/2 cups raw cashew pieces\n3/4 cup water\n2 tablespoons rice vinegar\njuice from 1 lemon (about 2 tablespoons)\n1 teaspoon salt\n1 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder\n1 1/2 teaspoon onion powder\n1/4 cup fresh dill OR 2-3 teaspoons dried dill*\n\nInstructions:\nSoak the raw cashew pieces in hot water for 5-10 minutes. I heat up water in my electric kettle and pour it over the cashews to soak.&nbsp;\nDrain the cashews and add to your blender. Add the remaining ingredients except the dill, and blend until very smooth.\nNow add the dill, and pulse a few times to combine. You don't want to blend the dill or it will end up very green.&nbsp;\nServe on salad or with fresh vegetables for dipping. This will keep for up to a week in the fridge. It will thicken in the fridge, just thin out with water until it reaches the consistency you prefer.&nbsp;", {"entities": [[13, 23, "QUANTITY"], [24, 41, "INGREDIENT"], [42, 49, "QUANTITY"], [50, 55, "INGREDIENT"], [56, 69, "QUANTITY"], [70, 82, "INGREDIENT"], [109, 122, "QUANTITY"], [124, 134, "QUANTITY"], [135, 139, "INGREDIENT"], [140, 154, "QUANTITY"], [155, 168, "INGREDIENT"], [169, 183, "QUANTITY"], [184, 196, "INGREDIENT"], [197, 204, "QUANTITY"], [205, 244, "INGREDIENT"], [269, 286, "INGREDIENT"], [290, 299, "INGREDIENT"], [328, 333, "INGREDIENT"], [377, 384, "INGREDIENT"], [410, 417, "INGREDIENT"], [422, 425, "PROCESS"], [484, 488, "INGREDIENT"], [523, 526, "PROCESS"], [531, 535, "INGREDIENT"], [599, 603, "INGREDIENT"], [663, 668, "INGREDIENT"], [669, 679, "INGREDIENT"], [776, 780, "PROCESS"], [790, 795, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
