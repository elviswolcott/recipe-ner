Using an immersion blender, blend until the soup is very smooth. You may also blend it all in a regular blender if desired.\nTaste and adjust, adding more salt if desired, or 1-2 teaspoons sugar to cut down on any acidity.&nbsp;\nNow stir in 1/2-1 cup of full fat coconut milk, to add creaminess and richness to the soup.
