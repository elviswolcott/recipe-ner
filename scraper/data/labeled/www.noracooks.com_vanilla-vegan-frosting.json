["Ingredients:\n1 cup earth balance vegan butter, softened to room temperature\n3 cups powdered sugar\n2-3 tablespoons unsweetened non-dairy milk\n1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n\nInstructions:\nBeat the vegan butter with an electric mixer until creamy.\nGradually add the powdered sugar, about 1/2 cup at a time, until all the powdered sugar is mixed in.\nWith the mixer on low-medium speed, add the non-dairy milk, 1 tablespoon at a time. Add the vanilla as well, and increase the speed to high. Beat for about 30 seconds, until light and fluffy.\nIf the frosting seems too thick, you can add more non-dairy milk, 1 tablespoon at a time. If the frosting is too thin and runny, simply add more powdered sugar, 1/2 cup at a time until the desired consistency is reached.\nUse it to frost Funfetti Cupcakes, Chocolate Cake (or cupcakes) or Vegan Vanilla Cake.\nYou can store the frosting in the refrigerator for 1-2 weeks. It will firm up when it's cold, so let it soften at room temperature a bit before frosting a cake or cupcakes with it.", {"entities": [[13, 18, "QUANTITY"], [19, 75, "INGREDIENT"], [76, 82, "QUANTITY"], [83, 97, "INGREDIENT"], [100, 113, "QUANTITY"], [114, 140, "INGREDIENT"], [141, 151, "QUANTITY"], [152, 172, "INGREDIENT"], [197, 209, "INGREDIENT"], [257, 260, "PROCESS"], [265, 279, "INGREDIENT"], [287, 294, "QUANTITY"], [320, 334, "INGREDIENT"], [338, 343, "PROCESS"], [384, 387, "PROCESS"], [392, 406, "INGREDIENT"], [408, 420, "QUANTITY"], [440, 447, "INGREDIENT"], [577, 580, "INGREDIENT"], [581, 584, "PROCESS"], [590, 604, "INGREDIENT"], [606, 618, "QUANTITY"], [653, 657, "PROCESS"], [676, 679, "PROCESS"], [685, 699, "INGREDIENT"], [701, 708, "QUANTITY"], [796, 805, "INGREDIENT"], [852, 855, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
