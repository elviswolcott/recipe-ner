["Ingredients:\n2 cups vegan chocolate chips\n2 teaspoons refined coconut oil\n1/3 cup smooth peanut butter\n1 tablespoon maple syrup\n2-3 tablespoons oat flour\n6  soft Medjool dates\n1/4 cup roasted unsalted peanuts\n\nInstructions:\nMake the peanut butter nougat. Warm the peanut butter in the microwave, if it&#39;s\u00c2\u00a0too stiff. Then mix in the maple syrup. Add in the oat flour until the mixture is slightly stiff then set aside.\nMelt the chocolate. Add the chocolate and coconut oil to a double boiler and heat over medium heat. Start whisking when the chocolate is starting to melt and whisk until the chocolate is melted evenly. Take off heat. You can also melt the chocolate in the microwave. Melt in 30-second intervals and whisk. Once half of the chocolate has started melting and just whisk so that it&#39;s melted evenly.\nPrep a muffin tin by adding muffin liners.\nAdd about 2 teaspoons of melted chocolate to the liner and move the liner to spread around at the bottom so that the chocolate goes up at least half an inch on the edges. You can use up to a tablespoon of melted chocolate, \u00c2\u00a0if the chocolate isn&#39;t spreading enough.\nThen take about 2-3 teaspoons of the peanut butter nougat mixture then make it into a ball then flatten it so that it&#39;s almost the size of the muffin hole and place it on the melted chocolate.\nSlice the date in half and remove the pit. Then spread out the half date into a somewhat circle so that it will fit over the peanut butter mixture and then place it on the peanut butter mixture in the muffin pan.\nSpread some peanuts on top then add a tablespoon of the melted chocolate all over and spread it so that it covers all of the peanuts and also drips on the side.\nRepeat to finish all the peanut nougat and chocolate. Place the muffin pan in the fridge so that the chocolate can harden.\nRemove from the muffin liners after an hour and serve.
