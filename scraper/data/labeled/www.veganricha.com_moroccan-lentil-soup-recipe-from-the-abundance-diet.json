Add the onion, carrot, and garlic and saut\u00c3\u00a9, adding additional broth as necessary to keep the vegetables from burning. Saut\u00c3\u00a9 until the onions are softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the coriander, cumin, turmeric, smoked paprika, cinnamon, and ground ginger. Saut\u00c3\u00a9 the vegetables and seasonings for 1 to 2 minutes to allow the flavors to bloom.
