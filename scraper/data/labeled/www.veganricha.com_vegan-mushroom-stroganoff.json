["Ingredients:\n2 tsp oil\n1/2  medium onion (finely chopped, about 3/4 cup)\n4  garlic cloves (finely chopped)\n10-12 oz mushrooms (white, cremini or combination, thinly sliced)\n1/4 tsp salt (or to taste)\n1 tbsp soy sauce (or tamari for gluten-free)\n1 tbsp vegan Worcestershire sauce\n1 tsp dijon mustard\n1/2 tsp dried thyme\n1/4 cup white wine (or use vegetable broth)\n2.5 cups mushroom stock (or vegetable broth.)\n2.5 cups dried pasta such as fusilli (or farfalle)\n1/4 cup cashew cream (which is 1/4 cup cashews blended with 1/4 cup water)\nfresh black pepper (pepper flakes, vegan parm, and dill for serving.)\n\nInstructions:\nHeat a skillet over medium heat, add oil, and add in the onion, garlic, and mushrooms, and half of the salt and mix in.\nCook until the mushrooms are golden brown on most of the edges, about 9-12 minutes. Stir occasionally in between\nOnce the mushrooms are golden brown, remove half of the mushrooms to use as a garnish later.\nAdd in the sauces, herbs, stock, and mix in, and add in the rest of the salt, pasta, and mix in. If the stock doesn&#039;t cover the pasta, add in 1/4 cup more stock.\nCover the skillet and cook for 19-21 minutes, or until the stock is absorbed by the pasta, and the pasta is well cooked.\nStir the pasta once in between, so that any of the pasta that is on the top also gets cooked evenly.\nAdd in the cashew cream, and mix in. Cook for a minute or two to thicken, taste and adjust salt and flavor.\nThen serve the pasta in bowls, topped with the reserved mushrooms, top with pepper flakes, vegan parm, and dill or parsley, and serve. The pasta will keep in the fridge for up to 4 days.\nTo make without Pasta: blend 1/3 cup cashews with 1 cup stock 2 tsp flour or cornstarch. Add the well blended mix to the skillet at step 4, bring to a boil and cook for 2-3 more mins minutes to thicken then use.", {"entities": [[13, 18, "QUANTITY"], [19, 22, "INGREDIENT"], [35, 40, "INGREDIENT"], [49, 56, "INGREDIENT"], [64, 71, "QUANTITY"], [76, 82, "INGREDIENT"], [83, 89, "INGREDIENT"], [98, 105, "INGREDIENT"], [110, 115, "QUANTITY"], [116, 125, "INGREDIENT"], [158, 171, "INGREDIENT"], [173, 180, "QUANTITY"], [181, 185, "INGREDIENT"], [200, 206, "QUANTITY"], [207, 216, "INGREDIENT"], [221, 227, "INGREDIENT"], [245, 251, "QUANTITY"], [252, 278, "INGREDIENT"], [279, 284, "QUANTITY"], [285, 298, "INGREDIENT"], [299, 306, "QUANTITY"], [307, 318, "INGREDIENT"], [319, 326, "QUANTITY"], [327, 337, "INGREDIENT"], [346, 361, "INGREDIENT"], [372, 386, "INGREDIENT"], [391, 406, "INGREDIENT"], [418, 445, "INGREDIENT"], [450, 458, "INGREDIENT"], [460, 467, "QUANTITY"], [468, 480, "INGREDIENT"], [491, 498, "QUANTITY"], [499, 506, "INGREDIENT"], [520, 527, "QUANTITY"], [528, 533, "INGREDIENT"], [535, 553, "INGREDIENT"], [555, 568, "INGREDIENT"], [570, 580, "INGREDIENT"], [586, 590, "INGREDIENT"], [653, 656, "PROCESS"], [657, 660, "INGREDIENT"], [666, 669, "PROCESS"], [677, 682, "INGREDIENT"], [684, 690, "INGREDIENT"], [696, 705, "INGREDIENT"], [723, 727, "INGREDIENT"], [732, 735, "PROCESS"], [755, 764, "INGREDIENT"], [862, 871, "INGREDIENT"], [909, 918, "INGREDIENT"], [965, 970, "INGREDIENT"], [972, 977, "INGREDIENT"], [983, 986, "PROCESS"], [995, 998, "PROCESS"], [1018, 1022, "INGREDIENT"], [1024, 1029, "INGREDIENT"], [1035, 1038, "PROCESS"], [1050, 1055, "INGREDIENT"], [1079, 1084, "INGREDIENT"], [1086, 1089, "PROCESS"], [1093, 1100, "QUANTITY"], [1106, 1111, "INGREDIENT"], [1135, 1139, "PROCESS"], [1172, 1177, "INGREDIENT"], [1197, 1202, "INGREDIENT"], [1212, 1217, "INGREDIENT"], [1226, 1232, "INGREDIENT"], [1243, 1248, "INGREDIENT"], [1285, 1290, "INGREDIENT"], [1320, 1326, "INGREDIENT"], [1346, 1358, "INGREDIENT"], [1364, 1367, "PROCESS"], [1426, 1430, "INGREDIENT"], [1458, 1463, "INGREDIENT"], [1499, 1508, "INGREDIENT"], [1519, 1532, "INGREDIENT"], [1534, 1544, "INGREDIENT"], [1550, 1554, "INGREDIENT"], [1558, 1565, "INGREDIENT"], [1582, 1587, "INGREDIENT"], [1659, 1666, "QUANTITY"], [1667, 1674, "INGREDIENT"], [1680, 1685, "QUANTITY"], [1686, 1691, "INGREDIENT"], [1692, 1697, "QUANTITY"], [1698, 1717, "INGREDIENT"], [1740, 1743, "PROCESS"], [1781, 1785, "PROCESS"], [1790, 1794, "PROCESS"]]}]
