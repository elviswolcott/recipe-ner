["Ingredients:\n1  large eggplant\n1/2  medium onion chopped\n1  medium tomato chopped\n1 inch ginger chopped\n3 cloves of garlic chopped\n1  Serrano pepper chopped\n2 teaspoons oil\n1/2 teaspoon turmeric\npinch of asofetida\n1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste\n1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds\n1 teaspoon dry coriander powder\n1 cup cilantro leaves for garnish\n\nInstructions:\nRoast the eggplant on a medium flame gas burner for 15-20 minutes, moving it every 4-5 minutes. It should start becoming charred and mushy and look like the picture above. I dont roast the eggplant completely like my mom does, because then the gas burner becomes very messy. The eggplant starts to drip once the skin gets charred and open. I usually put a foil and some water in the burner base to help with the cleaning later. The burner top though, you cant save:). I just char the skin to get the roasted taste in the eggplant.\nLet the eggplant cool and then remove the as much skin as possible.\nMash the eggplant.\nIn a large pan, heat the oil.\nAdd in the mustard seeds and wait till they sputter.\nAdd in the turmeric, and coriander powder and mix well.\nAdd in the chopped ginger, garlic and Serrano pepper and mix well. Let cook on medium flame for 5 minutes\nAdd in the chopped onions and cook them till soft(5-7 minutes)\nAdd in the chopped tomato and the mashed eggplant and mix well.\nAdd in salt and cook covered on medium-low flame.\nStir every 5 minutes.\nIn about 10-15 minutes the mixture will start to dry up a bit.\nSome people like the bharta more wet than others.. I like mine quite dry so I cook it for 10-15 minutes on low heat till it is dry and a nice earthy brown color.\nGarnish with cilantro leaves and serve hot with chapatis, or Naan or any Indian Bread!", {"entities": [[43, 56, "INGREDIENT"], [67, 73, "INGREDIENT"], [74, 81, "INGREDIENT"], [89, 103, "INGREDIENT"], [106, 112, "INGREDIENT"], [116, 130, "INGREDIENT"], [142, 148, "INGREDIENT"], [149, 156, "INGREDIENT"], [157, 168, "QUANTITY"], [169, 172, "INGREDIENT"], [173, 185, "QUANTITY"], [186, 194, "INGREDIENT"], [204, 213, "INGREDIENT"], [214, 226, "QUANTITY"], [227, 243, "INGREDIENT"], [244, 256, "QUANTITY"], [257, 270, "INGREDIENT"], [271, 281, "QUANTITY"], [282, 302, "INGREDIENT"], [303, 308, "QUANTITY"], [309, 336, "INGREDIENT"], [531, 536, "PROCESS"], [722, 727, "INGREDIENT"], [852, 859, "PROCESS"], [995, 998, "INGREDIENT"], [1011, 1024, "INGREDIENT"], [1064, 1072, "INGREDIENT"], [1078, 1094, "INGREDIENT"], [1099, 1102, "PROCESS"], [1120, 1134, "INGREDIENT"], [1136, 1142, "INGREDIENT"], [1155, 1161, "INGREDIENT"], [1166, 1169, "PROCESS"], [1180, 1184, "PROCESS"], [1226, 1240, "INGREDIENT"], [1245, 1249, "PROCESS"], [1289, 1303, "INGREDIENT"], [1312, 1318, "INGREDIENT"], [1332, 1335, "PROCESS"], [1349, 1353, "INGREDIENT"], [1358, 1362, "PROCESS"], [1555, 1559, "PROCESS"], [1652, 1667, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
