["Ingredients:\n3/4 cup bread flour\n1/3 cup whole wheat flour ((Use bread flour for totally white and even squishier buns))\n1 teaspoon vital wheat gluten (optional, for better gluten formation and some extra protein)\n1.5 tablespoon hot cereal mix ((I use 4 grains+ flax cereal. cracked wheat, steel cuts oats, rye and barley grits, flax seeds))\n1 tablespoon raw sugar or equivalent jaggery/agave/maple syrup or other sweeteners.\n1.5 teaspoons quick rise yeast\n2/3 cup water\n2 tablespoons Virgin olive oil\n1 tablespoons vegan butter like earth balance\n1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste\n1 teaspoon lemon juice\n1/2 teaspoon dried basil flakes or black pepper or garlic flakes for a fun twist to the flavor.\n\nInstructions:\nCook the hot cereal in 1/2 cup of boiling water for 5-7 minutes or until tender. All of the water might not be absorbed.\nLet the mixture cool a little to about warm to touch. Add the yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar and mix well. Let stand for 10 minutes or until frothy.\nAdd in the flours and rest of the ingredients and give a mix for a few seconds. (For a more wheat bun, use 3/4 cup wheat flour and 1/3 cup bread flour. you might need a little more water for a soft dough.)\nIf the dough looks too dry, add a little water and knead.\nKnead the dough for 4-5 minutes by hand or in mixer, scraping sides every 2 minutes if using a stand mixer. add more bread flour or water in little quantities if needed.\nYou can let this dough sit in a covered container for an hour for the first rise and then shape into balls and let rise again for 30 minutes, Or directly go to the next step.\nDivide dough into equal parts(or parts half the size of bun size you want) and roll into a ball pull and tuck under) and place on parchment on baking sheet, an inch apart.\nSpritz the top with water, sprinkle sesame seeds or seeds of choice,then spritz oil spray, and cover with a towel.\nPlace it in a warm place or warm oven for 35-40 minutes or until doubled.\nRemove towel and bake at preheated 350 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until the bread sounds hollow.\nRemove buns from sheet, spritz a fine mist of water and then oil on top and let cool on rack.\nPull the buns apart, dip in some herbed olive oil and enjoy as is! or slice into halfs and use for your favorite burger! Buns ready in just about an hour!
