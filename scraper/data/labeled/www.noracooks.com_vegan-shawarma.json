["Ingredients:\n4 ounces soy curls (half a bag)\n3 cups warm water\n1/4 cup olive oil\n3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice\n5-6  garlic cloves, minced\n1 teaspoon salt\n1 teaspoon cardamom\n1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n1 teaspoon paprika\n1/2 teaspoon ground cumin\n1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes\n4-5  flatbread or pita\ndill pickles, spears or slices\nsliced or quartered tomatoes\nlettuce\nShawarma Sauce\n\nInstructions:\nPrepare soy curls: In a large bowl, add the dehydrated soy curls, then cover with 3 cups warm water. Let them rehydrate for about 10 minutes until they have grown in size and softened. Drain in a colander and squeeze any excess water from the pieces.\nMarinate: In a large bowl, add all the marinade ingredients and whisk to combine. Add the soaked and drained soy curls to the bowl with the marinade and stir to coat the soy curls. Cover the bowl and place in the refrigerator to marinate for 1 hour (or up to a day).\nCook: After the soy curls have marinated for at least an hour, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add a few tablespoons of olive oil, then add the soy curls, including the marinade, and fry for about 5 minutes, until they get a little blackened in some areas. Remove from heat.\nServe: Serve the soy curl shawarma in pita or flatbread with pickles, tomatoes, lettuce and my amazing Shawarma Sauce, a simple tahini sauce or even just plain vegan yogurt.
