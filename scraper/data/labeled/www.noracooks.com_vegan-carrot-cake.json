["Ingredients:\n2 1/2 cups all purpose flour\n1 cup brown sugar\n1 cup white sugar\n2 teaspoons baking powder\n1 teaspoon baking soda\n2 teaspoons cinnamon\n1/2 teaspoon ground ginger\n1/4  teaspoon nutmeg\n1 teaspoon salt\n1/2 cup canola oil\n1 cup applesauce\n3/4 cup almond milk\n1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract\n3 cups grated carrots (about 3 large carrots)\n1 cup chopped walnuts, optional\n1 Recipe Vegan Cream Cheese Frosting\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F and prepare 2 round 8-inch cake pans by lining the bottom with parchment paper and spraying well with oil.\nIn a large bowl, add all the dry ingredients and whisk well.&nbsp;\nPour in the canola oil, applesauce, almond milk and vanilla and mix until combined with a large spoon. Now fold in the grated carrots and walnuts. Be very careful not to over mix the batter, or your cake will come out dense and chewy!\nPour the cake batter evenly between the prepared pans, then bake for 35-45 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean and the tops of the cakes are set. Remove from the oven, and allow to cool for about 20 minutes before carefully removing from the pans. Allow the cakes to cool completely before frosting.\nOnce cooled completely, frost with Vegan Cream Cheese Frosting, or Vegan Vanilla Frosting if preferred. Enjoy! Store leftover cake in the refrigerator for up to 1 week, covered.", {"entities": [[13, 23, "QUANTITY"], [24, 41, "INGREDIENT"], [42, 47, "QUANTITY"], [48, 59, "INGREDIENT"], [60, 65, "QUANTITY"], [66, 77, "INGREDIENT"], [78, 89, "QUANTITY"], [90, 103, "INGREDIENT"], [104, 114, "QUANTITY"], [115, 126, "INGREDIENT"], [127, 138, "QUANTITY"], [139, 147, "INGREDIENT"], [148, 160, "QUANTITY"], [161, 174, "INGREDIENT"], [175, 188, "QUANTITY"], [189, 195, "INGREDIENT"], [196, 206, "QUANTITY"], [207, 211, "INGREDIENT"], [212, 219, "QUANTITY"], [220, 230, "INGREDIENT"], [231, 236, "QUANTITY"], [237, 247, "INGREDIENT"], [252, 267, "INGREDIENT"], [268, 280, "QUANTITY"], [281, 301, "INGREDIENT"], [302, 308, "QUANTITY"], [309, 323, "INGREDIENT"], [339, 346, "INGREDIENT"], [348, 353, "QUANTITY"], [354, 379, "INGREDIENT"], [568, 571, "INGREDIENT"], [590, 593, "PROCESS"], [622, 627, "PROCESS"], [652, 662, "INGREDIENT"], [664, 674, "INGREDIENT"], [676, 687, "INGREDIENT"], [692, 699, "INGREDIENT"], [704, 707, "PROCESS"], [759, 773, "INGREDIENT"], [778, 785, "INGREDIENT"], [815, 818, "PROCESS"], [935, 939, "PROCESS"]]}]
