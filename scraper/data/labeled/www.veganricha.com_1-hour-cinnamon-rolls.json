I usually use oil)\n1 tsp nutritional yeast (optional)\n2.5 cups or more flour (I use unbleached white or a combination of white and wheat flour)\n1/3 tsp salt\n1 to 2 tbsp Oil  (or melted vegan butter)\n1/3 cup or more coconut sugar  (or brown sugar)\n2 to 3 tsp cinnamon\n1/4 tsp salt\nAdd some cardamom or nutmeg for variation\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F / 180c. Line a 8 by 8 inch brownie pan or 9 inch pie pan with parchment. Mix the first 5 ingredients under rolls until the sugar is mixed in. Let sit for a minute for the yeast to activate.\nAdd in the oil, nutritional yeast and mix in. Add 2 cups flour and salt and knead. Add more flour, few tbsps at a time to make a soft somewhat smooth dough. 4 to 6 mins.\nRoll the dough out using additional flour into a 10 by 14 inch rectangle\nSpray or brush oil or vegan butter on the rolled out dough. (use as much melted vegan butter as you like :)).Sprinkle sugar, cinnamon and salt evenly. Roll the dough tightly along the longer edge to make a cylinder.\nSlice using a pizza cutter or floss or a serrated knife. Place the slices in a parchment lined brownie baking pan or pie pan. Spray or brush oil on top. Cover lightly with a towel and Let the pan sit near the warm oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until just about doubled. Remove the towel.\nBake at 350f / 180c for 21 to 23 minutes or until golden on some edges.(just about starting to get golden)\nLet the rolls sit for a few minutes, while you make the icing or frosting of choice. Frost and serve.", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 35, "INGREDIENT"], [36, 43, "QUANTITY"], [44, 52, "INGREDIENT"], [53, 59, "QUANTITY"], [60, 84, "INGREDIENT"], [85, 91, "QUANTITY"], [92, 103, "INGREDIENT"], [114, 126, "INGREDIENT"], [131, 140, "QUANTITY"], [141, 153, "INGREDIENT"], [155, 161, "QUANTITY"], [162, 165, "INGREDIENT"], [174, 193, "INGREDIENT"], [209, 212, "INGREDIENT"], [214, 219, "QUANTITY"], [220, 237, "INGREDIENT"], [258, 271, "INGREDIENT"], [326, 337, "INGREDIENT"], [339, 351, "INGREDIENT"], [357, 363, "QUANTITY"], [364, 367, "INGREDIENT"], [373, 392, "INGREDIENT"], [394, 401, "QUANTITY"], [402, 423, "INGREDIENT"], [429, 440, "INGREDIENT"], [447, 452, "QUANTITY"], [453, 461, "INGREDIENT"], [462, 469, "QUANTITY"], [470, 474, "INGREDIENT"], [484, 502, "INGREDIENT"], [689, 694, "INGREDIENT"], [698, 703, "PROCESS"], [737, 742, "INGREDIENT"], [767, 770, "INGREDIENT"], [772, 789, "INGREDIENT"], [794, 797, "PROCESS"], [806, 812, "QUANTITY"], [813, 818, "INGREDIENT"], [823, 827, "INGREDIENT"], [832, 837, "PROCESS"], [848, 853, "INGREDIENT"], [962, 967, "INGREDIENT"], [1014, 1033, "INGREDIENT"], [1072, 1091, "INGREDIENT"], [1117, 1122, "INGREDIENT"], [1124, 1132, "INGREDIENT"], [1137, 1141, "INGREDIENT"], [1318, 1324, "PROCESS"], [1356, 1359, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
