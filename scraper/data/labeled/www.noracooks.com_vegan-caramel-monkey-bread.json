["Ingredients:\n1/4 cup warm water\n2 1/4 teaspoons dry active yeast (1 packet)\n1/4 cup granulated sugar\n1 cup soy milk\n2 tablespoons vegan butter, melted (I use earth balance)\n3 1/2 cups all purpose flour\n1 1/2 teaspoons salt\n1/2 cup vegan butter\n1/2 cup full fat coconut milk (the thick white part)\n1 1/2 cups brown sugar\npinch of salt, optional\n\nInstructions:\nMake the dough: In a mixing bowl, add the warm water and yeast. Let sit for 5 minutes, it should get a bit foamy on top. Now add the rest of the dough ingredients, and mix. Knead a little with your hands to combine. It should be sticky. Cover with a towel and set aside to rise for about 2 hours, then stick it in the fridge to cool.\nMake the caramel: Melt the vegan butter in a small pan over medium heat. Now add the coconut milk and brown sugar, and stir. Bring to a boil and stir constantly for 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Add a sprinkle of salt, if desired.\nPreheat the oven to&nbsp; 350 degrees F and lightly grease a bundt or pie pan.\nAssemble: Punch the cold dough gently to release the air bubbles. Pull apart and shape into 1 1/2 inch balls. In prepared pan, layer 1/4 cup caramel, dough balls, 1/4 cup caramel, dough balls and pour 1/4 more cup caramel on top. Reserve the remaining caramel.\nBake for 25-30 minutes, or until the top pieces are starting to get golden. Cool for 5-10 minutes, and then invert carefully onto a serving plate. Drizzle extra caramel on top, if desired, and serve.
