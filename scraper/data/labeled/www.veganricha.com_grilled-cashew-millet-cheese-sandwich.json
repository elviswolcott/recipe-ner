Place on parchment lined sheet.\nSprinkle salt and dried herbs of choice and bake at 415 degrees F / 210c for 18-20 minutes.\nCashew Millet Cheese: Blend all the ingredients except millet. Taste and adjust salt and spice.\nAdd millet and blend again to somewhat smooth state. Some unblended millet is fine.\nIf you are not planning to grill the sandwich at high heat, you can omit the tapioca starch. The starch helps the cheese sauce thicken and get stringy when hot. The cheese then sets as it cools and holds the sandwich together. * You can also use cooked quinoa or 2 tbsp more ground cashew.\nSandwich:\nMake the Pea pesto.
