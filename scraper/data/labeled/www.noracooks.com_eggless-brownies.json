["Ingredients:\n1/2 cup aquafaba (liquid from a can of chickpeas)\n1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar\n1 1/2 cups granulated sugar\n2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract\n1 cup vegan chocolate chips\n1/2 cup vegan butter (1 stick or 8 tablespoons)\n1 1/2 cups all purpose flour\n1/2 cup dutch processed cocoa powder\n1 teaspoon baking powder\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 cup additional vegan chocolate chips, optional\n\nInstructions:\nLine a 8x8 inch pan with parchment paper and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.\nBeat aquafaba with cream of tartar for 5 minutes until stiff peaks form. I use my stand mixer with whisk attachment, but you can use an electric hand mixer. Slowly add in the sugar, about 1/4 cup at a time, until it&#39;s all incorporated. It should be very fluffy at this point with stiff peaks. Beat in the vanilla and set aside.\nIn a microwave safe bowl, add the chocolate chips and vegan butter. Melt in the microwave in 30 second intervals, whisking well at each interval, until melted.\nPour the melted chocolate/butter mixture into the aquafaba mixture and stir gently with a spatula. The aquafaba mixture will shrink at this point but that is fine.\nTo a medium bowl, whisk the flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt together until combined and no clumps remain. If your cocoa is really clumpy, use a sifter.\nAdd the dry ingredients to the wet and stir until combined using a spatula. Fold in the additional chocolate chips, if using. Pour the brownie batter into the prepared pan, even it out with a spatula or your hands and bake for 35-37 minutes until the top is shiny.\nLet cool for at least 30 minutes as the brownies will firm up as they cool.
