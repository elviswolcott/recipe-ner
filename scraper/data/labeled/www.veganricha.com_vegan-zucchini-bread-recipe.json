["Ingredients:\n3/4 cup non dairy milk (, such as almond milk, soy milk)\n1/3 cup raw sugar or light brown sugar or coconut sugar (, 1-2 tbsp more for sweeter)\n3 tbsp chia seeds\n3 tbsp oil\n1/4 cup maple syrup\n1/2 tsp vanilla extract\n1.5 cups flour ((I use 1 cup unbleached all purpose and 1/2 cup wheat))\n1.5 tsp baking powder\n1/4 tsp baking soda\n1/2 tsp salt\n1/2 tsp spices like cinnamon (, optional)\n1 cup shredded zucchini (, squeezed between paper towels to remove excess moisture)\n1/3 cup chocolate chips (, plus more for topping)\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 365 deg F (190 C), line a loaf pan with parchment or grease well. Mix non dairy milk and chia seeds in a large bowl and let sit for 10 mins. Then whisk in the rest of the wet ingredients until well combined.&nbsp;\nFold in the zucchini. Add the dry ingredients (start with 1.25 cups flour if using&nbsp; more whole grain flour, and more a tbsp at a time), and mix to make a thick muffin like batter. Fold in the chocolate chips (and 1/4 cup chopped nuts if using). ( If omitting the chia seeds from the wet, you will need a bit more flour to get the thick batter).\nPour into prepared pan. Sprinkle 1 tbsp chocolate chips on top.\nBake at 365 degrees F (190 deg C) for 55 to 65 minutes or until a toothpick comes out almost clean from the center. (baking time will depend on the moisture content of the zucchini and the batter) .
