If you added too much flour or oatmeal and the mixture looks like a stiff dry dough, then add in a little oil and or lemon juice to make it gooey. (If the dough is stiff and not sticky, the cookies might come out too hard)\nOil hands or tablespoon and pick up tablespoon full dough, drop them and flatten on parchment paper. Thinner the better.!\nBake in preheated oven at 350 degrees F for 10-11 minutes(add minutes depending on the thickness of the cookie).
