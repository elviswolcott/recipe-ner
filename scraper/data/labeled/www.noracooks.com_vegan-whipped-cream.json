["Ingredients:\n1/2 cup aquafaba (liquid from 1 can of chickpeas)\n1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar\n1/2-3/4 cup powdered sugar\n1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n\nInstructions:\nDrain the liquid from a can of chickpeas into a large bowl. Reserve the chickpeas for another use. You should have about 1/2 cup of liquid, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be exact; a little more or a little less is fine.\nAdd the cream of tartar; this helps with the whipping process. With a hand mixer, start mixing on medium speed. Once it gets a little foamy, increase the speed to high and beat for about 3-4 minutes, until stiff peaks form.\nAdd the powdered sugar and vanilla and continue to beat about 1 more minute, until fluffy and smooth. That&#x27;s it!\nServe immediately for best results. Store leftover whipped cream in the freezer, it won&#x27;t hold up as well in the refrigerator. It reminds me a lot of cool whip straight from the freezer!", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 29, "INGREDIENT"], [45, 61, "INGREDIENT"], [63, 75, "QUANTITY"], [76, 91, "INGREDIENT"], [96, 103, "QUANTITY"], [104, 118, "INGREDIENT"], [119, 129, "QUANTITY"], [130, 150, "INGREDIENT"], [190, 206, "INGREDIENT"], [238, 247, "INGREDIENT"], [287, 294, "QUANTITY"], [392, 407, "INGREDIENT"], [472, 478, "PROCESS"], [616, 630, "INGREDIENT"], [635, 642, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
