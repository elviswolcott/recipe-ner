["Ingredients:\n1 large head cauliflower (about 5-6 cups florets)\n1 cup water\n3/4 cup all purpose flour\n1 tablespoon garlic powder\n1 tablespoon onion powder\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n2 cups panko breadcrumbs\n18 ounces your favorite barbecue sauce OR Quick and Easy Vegan Barbecue Sauce\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat.&nbsp;\nWash and cut cauliflower into bite sized pieces. I like to leave some of the cauliflower stem on each piece, it makes them easier to pick up when eating.\nIn a large bowl, add water, flour, garlic and onion powder, and salt. Whisk until well combined. In a second, smaller bowl, add the panko breadcrumbs.&nbsp;\nAdd the cauliflower to the batter in the large bowl, and toss to coat. Remove the pieces of cauliflower, one by one, and tap off the excess batter a few times on the side of the bowl. Roll them in the breadcrumbs, coating on all sides, and place on the prepared baking sheet.\nBake for 15 minutes. Flip them over and bake for 10 more minutes, until brown and crispy. Remove from the oven.\nToss the florets with 1 1/2 cups barbecue sauce to coat in a large bowl, then return to the pan. Put them back in the oven for 15 minutes.&nbsp;\nRemove from the oven, brush with more barbecue sauce before serving, if desired. Serve with Vegan Ranch for dipping.
