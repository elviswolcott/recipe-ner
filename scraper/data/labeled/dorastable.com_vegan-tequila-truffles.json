["Ingredients:\n1/2 cup Coconut milk (full fat)\n12 oz. Vegan Dark Chocolate at least 70% Cacao (finely chopped)\n1 pinch Sea Salt\n1/2 tsp. Mexican Vanilla Extract\n2 tbsp. Tequila\n- tsp. Chili Powder (optional)\n1/4 cup Cocoa powder (for dusting)\n\nInstructions:\nIn a medium saucepan heat the the coconut milk over medium heat. When the milk comes to a low boil add the chopped chocolate and continually stir until about  of the chocolate has melted. Turn off the heat and add the pinch of salt, vanilla, tequila and chili powder if using. Keep stirring until all of the chocolate has melted.&nbsp;\nPour the chocolate into a loaf pan or shallow dish. Refrigerate for 2 hours, or until the chocolate is almost solid. If the chocolate is still wet in some spots continue chilling until firm.&nbsp;\nOnce the chocolate is chilled and firm, prepare a dish with the cocoa powder for rolling. Use a tablespoon sized scoop to scoop out small balls; I like to use a cookie scoop. Scoop out the tablespoon size balls then gently use your hands to roll into a round ball shape. Toss in cocoa powder to coat and shake off the excess. Transfer to a cookie sheet or pan lined with wax paper. Continue until all the chocolate has been scooped out. Depending on the size of the scoop, you should get about 14-16 truffles.&nbsp;\nEnjoy the truffles right away or store in a tightly covered container in the fridge. Let the truffles come up to room temperature before serving, about 10-15 minutes.&nbsp;", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 33, "INGREDIENT"], [45, 50, "QUANTITY"], [63, 72, "INGREDIENT"], [100, 107, "INGREDIENT"], [121, 125, "INGREDIENT"], [126, 133, "QUANTITY"], [159, 165, "QUANTITY"], [206, 213, "QUANTITY"], [214, 226, "INGREDIENT"], [290, 302, "INGREDIENT"], [330, 334, "INGREDIENT"], [350, 354, "PROCESS"], [355, 358, "PROCESS"], [363, 370, "INGREDIENT"], [371, 380, "INGREDIENT"], [397, 401, "PROCESS"], [422, 431, "INGREDIENT"], [466, 469, "PROCESS"], [474, 487, "INGREDIENT"], [489, 496, "INGREDIENT"], [510, 522, "INGREDIENT"], [538, 546, "PROCESS"], [564, 573, "INGREDIENT"], [601, 610, "INGREDIENT"], [682, 691, "INGREDIENT"], [716, 725, "INGREDIENT"], [798, 807, "INGREDIENT"], [853, 877, "INGREDIENT"], [1068, 1080, "INGREDIENT"], [1194, 1203, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
