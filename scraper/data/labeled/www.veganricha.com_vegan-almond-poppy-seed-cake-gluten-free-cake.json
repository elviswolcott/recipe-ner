Break the almond flour lumps if there are any, with your hand or a spatula..\nAdd to the wet and mix well until smooth.* Transfer the batter to a greased 6 inch pan.\nBake at 350 degrees F / 170c for 30 minutes or until a toothpick from the center comes out clean.\nCool for 15 mins, then remove from the pan. Cool completely before slicing. Preferably refrigerate for 15 to 20 mins and then slice. Use an icing of choice. A simple lemon sugar icing works really well.", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 35, "INGREDIENT"], [40, 46, "QUANTITY"], [47, 61, "INGREDIENT"], [64, 70, "QUANTITY"], [71, 87, "INGREDIENT"], [89, 95, "QUANTITY"], [96, 110, "INGREDIENT"], [111, 117, "QUANTITY"], [118, 129, "INGREDIENT"], [130, 136, "QUANTITY"], [137, 142, "INGREDIENT"], [158, 163, "QUANTITY"], [164, 171, "INGREDIENT"], [173, 201, "INGREDIENT"], [203, 208, "QUANTITY"], [209, 224, "INGREDIENT"], [225, 232, "QUANTITY"], [233, 247, "INGREDIENT"], [259, 264, "QUANTITY"], [265, 277, "INGREDIENT"], [301, 308, "QUANTITY"], [309, 315, "INGREDIENT"], [323, 329, "QUANTITY"], [330, 343, "INGREDIENT"], [346, 352, "QUANTITY"], [361, 365, "INGREDIENT"], [367, 374, "QUANTITY"], [375, 379, "INGREDIENT"], [380, 385, "QUANTITY"], [386, 399, "INGREDIENT"], [400, 407, "QUANTITY"], [408, 419, "INGREDIENT"], [425, 430, "QUANTITY"], [431, 442, "INGREDIENT"], [533, 536, "PROCESS"], [553, 567, "INGREDIENT"], [644, 649, "INGREDIENT"], [651, 656, "INGREDIENT"], [658, 665, "INGREDIENT"], [667, 674, "INGREDIENT"], [680, 687, "QUANTITY"], [688, 702, "INGREDIENT"], [733, 736, "PROCESS"], [737, 747, "INGREDIENT"], [790, 795, "INGREDIENT"], [799, 804, "PROCESS"], [826, 829, "PROCESS"], [834, 846, "INGREDIENT"], [858, 862, "INGREDIENT"], [864, 877, "INGREDIENT"], [888, 899, "INGREDIENT"], [911, 923, "INGREDIENT"], [997, 1000, "PROCESS"], [1336, 1341, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
