["Ingredients:\n4 tablespoons ground flax\n1/2 cup  water\n1/2 cup vegan butter (earth balance brand), melted (*see instructions)\n1 cup granulated sugar\n1 cup brown sugar, lightly packed\n1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract\n1 cup all purpose flour\n1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1 teaspoon baking powder\n1 cup non-dairy chocolate chips OR roughly chopped chocolate pieces\n\nInstructions:\nMake the flax eggs by stirring the ground flax and water in a small bowl. Set aside to thicken. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a 7 x 11 pan with parchment paper.\nMelt the vegan butter (earth balance brand preferred), and measure 1/2 cup. I do this by microwaving the vegan butter in a glass measuring cup, in 30 second intervals, until melted.\nIn a large bowl, whisk the melted vegan butter and sugars together. Add the flax eggs and vanilla, whisk until evenly combined.\nOver the same large bowl, sift in the flour and cocoa powder. Add the salt and baking powder and stir with a large wooden spoon until just combined, do not over mix.\u00c2\u00a0\nFold in half of the chocolate chips. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth out the top with a spoon or your hands. Sprinkle the rest of the chocolate chips on top of the batter.\nBake for 35-40 minutes. The brownies may still be bubbling and not look done, but they will firm up a lot as they cool.\nRemove from the oven, allow to cool in the pan for 15 minutes, then pull the brownies out, using the parchment paper and let cool for another 15-30 minutes before slicing and serving.", {"entities": [[13, 26, "QUANTITY"], [27, 38, "INGREDIENT"], [39, 46, "QUANTITY"], [48, 53, "INGREDIENT"], [54, 61, "QUANTITY"], [62, 74, "INGREDIENT"], [125, 130, "QUANTITY"], [131, 147, "INGREDIENT"], [148, 153, "QUANTITY"], [154, 181, "INGREDIENT"], [182, 194, "QUANTITY"], [195, 215, "INGREDIENT"], [216, 221, "QUANTITY"], [222, 239, "INGREDIENT"], [240, 245, "QUANTITY"], [246, 270, "INGREDIENT"], [271, 283, "QUANTITY"], [284, 288, "INGREDIENT"], [289, 299, "QUANTITY"], [300, 313, "INGREDIENT"], [314, 319, "QUANTITY"], [320, 381, "INGREDIENT"], [419, 427, "PROCESS"], [432, 443, "INGREDIENT"], [448, 453, "INGREDIENT"], [580, 592, "INGREDIENT"], [638, 645, "QUANTITY"], [676, 688, "INGREDIENT"], [710, 713, "QUANTITY"], [770, 775, "PROCESS"], [780, 799, "INGREDIENT"], [843, 850, "INGREDIENT"], [852, 857, "PROCESS"], [919, 924, "INGREDIENT"], [929, 941, "INGREDIENT"], [951, 955, "INGREDIENT"], [960, 973, "INGREDIENT"], [978, 982, "PROCESS"], [1042, 1045, "PROCESS"], [1069, 1084, "INGREDIENT"], [1200, 1215, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
