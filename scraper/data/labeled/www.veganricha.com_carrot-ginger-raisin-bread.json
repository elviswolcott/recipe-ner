Add more water if needed. The carrot will loose moisture during rising, so keep a dough a bit dry.\nPlace dough in a warm place, covered, for about an hour or until doubled.\nAdd some raisins to the dough and Knead for 5 minutes.\nShape dough into a loaf and place in a well greased bread pan.\nPlace bread pan in warm oven, with a pan of boiling water for half an hour.
