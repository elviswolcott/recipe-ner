["Ingredients:\n1 cup flour ((I use all purpose for soft pancakes), see Notes for glutenfree)\n1.75 tsp baking powder\n1/4 tsp salt\n1 tsp cinnamon\n3 tbsp sugar\n1 cup non dairy milk\n1/2 tsp vanilla extract\n1/2 tsp vinegar\n1 tbsp oil\n2 tbsp flour\n2 tbsp brown sugar\n1/4 tsp salt\n1 tsp cinnamon\n1 tbsp oil or melted vegan butter\n\nInstructions:\nIn a bowl, whisk the dry ingredients for pancakes until well combined.\nIn another small bowl, mix 3/4 cup non dairy milk, vanilla and vinegar. Add to the dry. Add oil and mix. Add more milk 2 tbsp at a time. Depending on the flours you will need 2 to 6 tbsp more. Whisk to make a pancake batter that is not too stiff and also not too thin.&nbsp;\nMix the flour, sugar,salt and cinnamon for the streusel in a bowl. Add oil and mix to make a crumbly mixture.\nHeat a skillet over medium heat. Brush oil. If making regular pancakes: Pour batter on the hot skillet. Top with some streusel. Cover the pan and cook for 3 to 4 mins. Then flip and cook for another 2 mins.\nIf making cookie cutter pancakes,&nbsp;Once the skillet is hot, place the cookie cutters on the skillet. Spray oil on the cutter. Pour pancake batter to reach a 1/3 to 1/2 of the height of the cookie cutter. Then sprinkle streusel. Cover the pan with a lid and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook for 5 to 7 minutes, then flip the pancake with the cookie cutter and cook for 2 mins. Remove from pan. Let cool for a minute then&nbsp; carefully loosen the cookie cutter.\nDrizzle with maple, icing or top with some cream cheese frosting or whipped coconut cream and fruits!", {"entities": [[13, 18, "QUANTITY"], [19, 24, "INGREDIENT"], [100, 113, "INGREDIENT"], [114, 121, "QUANTITY"], [122, 126, "INGREDIENT"], [127, 132, "QUANTITY"], [133, 141, "INGREDIENT"], [142, 148, "QUANTITY"], [149, 154, "INGREDIENT"], [155, 160, "QUANTITY"], [161, 175, "INGREDIENT"], [176, 183, "QUANTITY"], [184, 199, "INGREDIENT"], [200, 207, "QUANTITY"], [208, 215, "INGREDIENT"], [216, 222, "QUANTITY"], [223, 226, "INGREDIENT"], [227, 233, "QUANTITY"], [234, 239, "INGREDIENT"], [240, 246, "QUANTITY"], [247, 258, "INGREDIENT"], [259, 266, "QUANTITY"], [267, 271, "INGREDIENT"], [272, 277, "QUANTITY"], [278, 286, "INGREDIENT"], [287, 293, "QUANTITY"], [294, 320, "INGREDIENT"], [347, 352, "PROCESS"], [430, 433, "PROCESS"], [434, 441, "QUANTITY"], [442, 456, "INGREDIENT"], [458, 465, "INGREDIENT"], [470, 477, "INGREDIENT"], [499, 502, "INGREDIENT"], [507, 510, "PROCESS"], [521, 525, "INGREDIENT"], [526, 532, "QUANTITY"], [587, 593, "QUANTITY"], [690, 695, "INGREDIENT"], [697, 702, "INGREDIENT"], [703, 707, "INGREDIENT"], [712, 720, "INGREDIENT"], [753, 756, "INGREDIENT"], [761, 764, "PROCESS"], [831, 834, "INGREDIENT"], [938, 942, "PROCESS"], [974, 978, "PROCESS"], [1063, 1068, "PROCESS"], [1110, 1113, "INGREDIENT"], [1212, 1220, "PROCESS"], [1365, 1369, "PROCESS"], [1481, 1486, "INGREDIENT"], [1511, 1523, "INGREDIENT"], [1536, 1557, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
