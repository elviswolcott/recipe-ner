["Ingredients:\n1 small head of cauliflower\n3/4 cup all-purpose flour ((use chickpea flour for a gluten-free version))\n3/4 cup unsweetened almond or soy milk\n1/4 cup water\n2 teaspoons garlic powder\n2 teaspoons paprika powder\n1 cup panko bread crumbs\n1 cup Frank's Red Hot Buffalo Wings sauce\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n1/2 cup vegan mayonnaise\n1 teaspoon dried dill\n1 teaspoon dried parsley\n\nInstructions:\nCarefully cut the cauliflower into bite-sized florets.\nIn a large bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, the plant-based milk, the water, the garlic power, the paprika powder, the salt, and the black pepper. Stir until well combined.\nDip the florets into the batter, so they're completely coated.\nRoll them in the panko breadcrumbs. Omit this step for a gluten-free version. However, they're way crispier with the panko breadcrumb coating.\nLine a baking sheet with parchment paper and lay the cauliflower florets on the baking sheet. Don't put them on top of each other. Bake for 25 minutes at 350 F.\nCombine&nbsp;Frank's Red Hot Buffalo Wings sauce with a tablespoon of olive oil and pour it over the baked cauliflower wings. Evenly coat them from all sides by stirring them a few times.\nPut the coated buffalo wings back on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake again for 20 minutes at 350 F.\nFor the vegan ranch sauce, combine the vegan mayonnaise with dried dill and parsley and stir until well combined. Serve the freshly baked vegan cauliflower wings with the vegan ranch and enjoy! Also sprinkle some chopped green onions and freshly chopped parsley on top if you want.", {"entities": [[29, 40, "INGREDIENT"], [41, 48, "QUANTITY"], [49, 66, "INGREDIENT"], [73, 87, "INGREDIENT"], [116, 123, "QUANTITY"], [124, 154, "INGREDIENT"], [155, 162, "QUANTITY"], [163, 168, "INGREDIENT"], [169, 180, "QUANTITY"], [181, 194, "INGREDIENT"], [195, 206, "QUANTITY"], [207, 221, "INGREDIENT"], [222, 227, "QUANTITY"], [228, 246, "INGREDIENT"], [247, 252, "QUANTITY"], [253, 288, "INGREDIENT"], [289, 301, "QUANTITY"], [302, 311, "INGREDIENT"], [312, 319, "QUANTITY"], [320, 336, "INGREDIENT"], [337, 347, "QUANTITY"], [348, 358, "INGREDIENT"], [359, 369, "QUANTITY"], [370, 383, "INGREDIENT"], [417, 428, "INGREDIENT"], [445, 452, "INGREDIENT"], [483, 500, "INGREDIENT"], [506, 522, "INGREDIENT"], [528, 533, "INGREDIENT"], [539, 545, "INGREDIENT"], [557, 571, "INGREDIENT"], [577, 581, "INGREDIENT"], [591, 603, "INGREDIENT"], [639, 646, "INGREDIENT"], [711, 728, "INGREDIENT"], [811, 816, "INGREDIENT"], [844, 850, "PROCESS"], [890, 909, "INGREDIENT"], [917, 923, "PROCESS"], [956, 960, "INGREDIENT"], [1068, 1077, "INGREDIENT"], [1099, 1104, "PROCESS"], [1105, 1116, "INGREDIENT"], [1159, 1167, "PROCESS"], [1225, 1231, "PROCESS"], [1310, 1321, "INGREDIENT"], [1341, 1357, "INGREDIENT"], [1363, 1373, "INGREDIENT"], [1378, 1385, "INGREDIENT"], [1390, 1394, "PROCESS"], [1434, 1439, "PROCESS"], [1446, 1457, "INGREDIENT"], [1473, 1484, "INGREDIENT"], [1501, 1509, "PROCESS"], [1515, 1535, "INGREDIENT"], [1540, 1563, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
