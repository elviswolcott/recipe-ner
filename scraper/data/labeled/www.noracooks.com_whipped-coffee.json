["Ingredients:\n4 tablespoons instant coffee\n4 tablespoons granulated sugar\n4 tablespoons boiling hot water\n2 cups milk of choice, warm or cold\n\nInstructions:\nAdd the instant coffee granules, sugar and hot water to a medium sized mixing bowl.\nUsing a hand mixer, start mixing the ingredients on low speed. After a minute or so, it will grow in size and begin to get fluffy. At this point, increase the speed to medium and beat in a zig-zag motion until very fluffy with peaks.\nFor iced whipped coffee: In a glass, add a few cubes of ice and fill about 2/3 of the way full with milk of choice (I like oat milk). Add some whipped coffee on top of the milk, stir and enjoy immediately.\nFor warm whipped coffee: Steam or simply warm about 1 cup of milk (microwave works fine), then add a good serving of the whipped coffee on top and stir it into the milk. Enjoy.\n*Some recipes don&#39;t make it clear that you should stir the whipped coffee mixture into milk, but that is exactly what you should do for best results. It&#39;s quite strong on it&#39;s own, but tastes perfect once you stir it in. It will maintain the fluffiness even once stirred in, making it a delicious and unusual drink.", {"entities": [[13, 26, "QUANTITY"], [27, 41, "INGREDIENT"], [42, 55, "QUANTITY"], [56, 72, "INGREDIENT"], [73, 86, "QUANTITY"], [87, 104, "INGREDIENT"], [105, 111, "QUANTITY"], [112, 140, "INGREDIENT"], [164, 178, "INGREDIENT"], [189, 194, "INGREDIENT"], [199, 208, "INGREDIENT"], [227, 233, "PROCESS"], [266, 272, "PROCESS"], [318, 323, "INGREDIENT"], [511, 514, "PROCESS"], [530, 533, "INGREDIENT"], [574, 578, "INGREDIENT"], [597, 605, "INGREDIENT"], [646, 650, "INGREDIENT"], [652, 656, "PROCESS"], [732, 737, "QUANTITY"], [741, 745, "INGREDIENT"], [775, 778, "PROCESS"], [827, 831, "PROCESS"], [844, 848, "INGREDIENT"], [911, 915, "PROCESS"], [948, 952, "INGREDIENT"], [1078, 1082, "PROCESS"], [1132, 1139, "PROCESS"]]}]
