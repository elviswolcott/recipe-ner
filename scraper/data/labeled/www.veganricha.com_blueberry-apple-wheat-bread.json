Mix well and keep aside for 10 minutes or until frothy.\nAdd 1/2 cup (60g) bread flour to it, mix well and keep it for an hour and then refrigerate for 8-12 hours to get a sticky gooey sponge.\nFor the compote, boil 2/3 cup (160ml) of water and add 4 teaspoons sugar, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, and blueberries to it. Boil for 15-20 minutes until it thickens and all blueberries burst.\nFor the dough, Grease the mixer bowl and add in the flours and salt and 1 teaspoon quick rise yeast and.

Use more flour or water if needed.\nPlace dough in well oiled container, covered with plastic wrap in a warm place for 2 hours\nLightly take the dough out and fold it with additional flour if needed. Shape into loaf by pulling on all sides and tucking under. Use flour on hands to avoid dough sticking to hands. Handle dough gently to avoid losing the trapped air.\nPlace loaf in well oiled bread pan and cover with a damp kitchen towel. Let rise for 1.5 hours. Bake loaf at 375 degrees F for 40-45 minutes.\nCool completely before slicing. I usually place the cooled bread in the refrigerator for half an our before slicing with an electric knife for nice and clean slices!", {"entities": [[13, 18, "QUANTITY"], [19, 30, "INGREDIENT"], [33, 39, "QUANTITY"], [40, 57, "INGREDIENT"], [58, 70, "QUANTITY"], [71, 74, "INGREDIENT"], [75, 86, "INGREDIENT"], [87, 98, "QUANTITY"], [99, 104, "INGREDIENT"], [105, 115, "QUANTITY"], [116, 160, "INGREDIENT"], [161, 171, "QUANTITY"], [172, 176, "INGREDIENT"], [177, 183, "QUANTITY"], [184, 211, "INGREDIENT"], [255, 260, "INGREDIENT"], [293, 300, "QUANTITY"], [309, 314, "INGREDIENT"], [319, 322, "PROCESS"], [323, 333, "QUANTITY"], [334, 339, "INGREDIENT"], [344, 354, "QUANTITY"], [355, 367, "INGREDIENT"], [436, 443, "QUANTITY"], [445, 448, "QUANTITY"], [450, 461, "INGREDIENT"], [469, 472, "PROCESS"], [585, 589, "PROCESS"], [590, 597, "QUANTITY"], [606, 614, "INGREDIENT"], [619, 622, "PROCESS"], [623, 634, "QUANTITY"], [635, 640, "INGREDIENT"], [642, 654, "QUANTITY"], [655, 663, "INGREDIENT"], [665, 677, "QUANTITY"], [678, 684, "INGREDIENT"], [690, 701, "INGREDIENT"], [758, 769, "INGREDIENT"], [818, 821, "PROCESS"], [840, 844, "INGREDIENT"], [849, 859, "QUANTITY"], [860, 876, "INGREDIENT"], [903, 906, "INGREDIENT"], [917, 934, "INGREDIENT"], [944, 949, "INGREDIENT"], [955, 960, "PROCESS"], [1090, 1095, "INGREDIENT"], [1099, 1104, "INGREDIENT"], [1159, 1164, "INGREDIENT"], [1168, 1173, "INGREDIENT"], [1243, 1247, "PROCESS"], [1258, 1263, "PROCESS"], [1331, 1336, "INGREDIENT"], [1411, 1416, "INGREDIENT"], [1697, 1702, "PROCESS"]]}]
