["Ingredients:\n3 Tablespoons Raw turbinado sugar or jaggery\n1 teaspoon flax meal\n1 Tablespoon hot water\n2 Tablespoons roasted almond butter (Homemade nut butter recipes)\n1 Tablespoon Vegan butter or Organic Canola Oil or coconut oil\n1/2 teaspoon lemon juice\n1/4 teaspoon cinnamon powder\n1/8 teaspoon salt\n1/4 teaspoon baking powder\n1/3 cup raisins\n4 Tablespoons quinoa (blended coarsely or quinoa flour)\n1/3 cup oats\n2-3 Tablespoons whole wheat pastry flour (Or Rice Flour for a gluten free version)\n\nInstructions:\nIn a bowl, mix the flax meal and hot water and let sit for a minute.\nAdd in the room temperature almond butter, vegan butter or oil, sugar and mix well by hand or by hand mixer until the mixture feels light. The almond butter I used was store bought and it takes a while to mix up. Mix and let sit for a few minutes and then mix again to work that almond butter. I used spoon and woman hand power for the mixing!\nBlend/grind the quinoa to a coarse flour along with the baking powder.\nAdd in quinoa, oats, salt, cinnamon powder and lemon juice and a little wheat or rice flour and mix till just about combined.&nbsp;\nAdd in more oats and flour if needed to get gooey muffin mixture kind of consistency, Or a very sticky dough. If you added too much flour or oats and the mixture looks like a stiff dry dough, then add in a teaspoon oil and/or lemon juice to make it gooey.\nOil hands or tablespoon and pick up tablespoon full dough, drop them and flatten on parchment paper. Thinner the better.! Its hard to work with the sticky mixture, so I usually dont make round balls.:)\nBake in preheated oven at 350 degrees F for 10-12 minutes(add minutes depending on the thickness of the cookie). The cookies should not be runny or liquidy when done.\nTake cookies off baking tray and cool on rack for a few minutes!\nStore in airtight container for a week or so.
