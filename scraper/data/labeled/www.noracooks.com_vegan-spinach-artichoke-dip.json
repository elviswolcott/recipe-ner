["Ingredients:\n1 1/2 cups raw cashews\n4 cloves garlic\n1 small  onion, diced\n1 1/2 cups unsweetened non-dairy milk\n1/4 cup nutritional yeast\n1  small lemon, juiced (2 tablespoons)\n1-1 1/2 teaspoons salt\n4 cups loosely packed fresh spinach\n(2) 14-ounce cans artichokes (drained &amp; rinsed)\nOptional: Vegan Parmesan Cheese (for serving)\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees F.\nSoak the cashews: Heat up about 3 cups of water in a tea kettle or small pot. Pour the boiling hot water over the cashews and let them soak for 5 minutes. Drain them when ready to blend.\nIn a small pan, saute the garlic and onion for 2-3 minutes using either a tablespoon of olive oil or water, until the onion is slightly translucent. Set aside.\nIn a high powered blender such as a Vitamix, add the soaked, drained cashews, unsweetened milk, nutritional yeast, lemon juice, and 1 teaspoon salt. Blend until very smooth.&nbsp;\nNow add the cooked onions/garlic, spinach and artichokes. Pulse a couple of times, but do not blend. You want to leave quite a bit of chunky texture! Taste for salt, add more to taste.\nTransfer to an oven safe dish (I used a 9 inch pie dish) and bake for 20 minutes or so until warm, bubbly and golden brown on top.&nbsp;\nSprinkle with vegan parmesan&nbsp;, if desired and serve with a sliced baguette, pita chips, tortilla chips or vegetable sticks.
