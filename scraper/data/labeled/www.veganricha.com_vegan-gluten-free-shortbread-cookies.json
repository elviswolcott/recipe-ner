["Ingredients:\n1/2 cup white rice flour\n1/4 cup oat flour (use certified gluten-free if needed or use more rice flour)\n1/4 cup ground pistachio (or other nuts)\n1/4 cup coconut flour (or use cashew flour or oat flour)\n1/4 tsp salt\n1/4 tsp baking soda\n1/4 cup oil\n1/4 cup almond milk\n1 Tbsp chia seed meal  (or use golden flax seed meal)\n1.5 tsp vanilla extract\n1/2 cup coconut sugar (or use finely ground raw sugar for whiter cookies)\n\nInstructions:\nIn a bowl, add all the dry ingredients and mix well.\nIn another bowl, mix the chia seed meal with non dairy milk and let sit for 2 minutes. Add in the vanilla and oil and whisk. Add in the sugar and mix until sugar dissolves in.\nAdd to dry and mix. Knead well for 1-2 minutes to form a smooth dough. Spray water on the dough if it does not come together easily (not more than 2-4 sprays). Pat the dough down and use cookie cutters to cut desired shapes. I used 1 inch round cutter. Gather remaining dough, pat down and cut more cookies or shape into balls and flatten. Place the cookies on parchment lined baking sheet, cover with another parchment and refrigerate for 15 minutes(or 10 minutes in the freezer). Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F / 190c. Bake for 13-14 minutes(a few minutes longer for larger cookies) until the edges just about start to get golden. Move the cookies around from outside to inside at the 11 minute mark. Let cool completely. Serve as is or dip in melted chocolate or top with favorite frosting.\nNotes: Add mini chocolate chips or sprinkles to the dough. Do not over bake as the cookies can get quite crunchy. The dough can be stored in the refrigerator for upto 3 days.", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 37, "INGREDIENT"], [38, 45, "QUANTITY"], [46, 55, "INGREDIENT"], [105, 115, "INGREDIENT"], [117, 124, "QUANTITY"], [125, 141, "INGREDIENT"], [152, 156, "INGREDIENT"], [158, 165, "QUANTITY"], [166, 179, "INGREDIENT"], [188, 200, "INGREDIENT"], [204, 213, "INGREDIENT"], [215, 222, "QUANTITY"], [223, 227, "INGREDIENT"], [228, 235, "QUANTITY"], [236, 247, "INGREDIENT"], [248, 255, "QUANTITY"], [256, 259, "INGREDIENT"], [264, 279, "INGREDIENT"], [280, 286, "QUANTITY"], [287, 301, "INGREDIENT"], [318, 332, "INGREDIENT"], [342, 357, "INGREDIENT"], [358, 365, "QUANTITY"], [366, 379, "INGREDIENT"], [388, 411, "INGREDIENT"], [458, 461, "PROCESS"], [490, 493, "PROCESS"], [517, 520, "PROCESS"], [525, 539, "INGREDIENT"], [545, 559, "INGREDIENT"], [598, 605, "INGREDIENT"], [610, 613, "INGREDIENT"], [618, 623, "PROCESS"], [636, 641, "INGREDIENT"], [646, 649, "PROCESS"], [656, 661, "INGREDIENT"], [691, 694, "PROCESS"], [753, 758, "INGREDIENT"], [1053, 1059, "PROCESS"], [1432, 1441, "INGREDIENT"], [1484, 1504, "INGREDIENT"], [1544, 1548, "PROCESS"], [1564, 1567, "INGREDIENT"], [1597, 1600, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
