["Ingredients:\n3 large king oyster mushrooms\n1 tablespoon vegetable oil, for frying\n3 cloves garlic, finely minced\n1 inch ginger, finely minced\n1/2 tablespoons doubanjiang (spicy bean paste)\n1 tablespoon light soy sauce\n1 tablespoon dark soy sauce\n1 cube fermented bean curd with chili (optional)\n1/4 cup water\n1 tablespoon rice cooking wine (like Shaoxing wine)\n1 tablespoon sugar\n1  bay leaf\n1/2 teaspoon ground five-spice\n1/2 teaspoon toasted sesame oil\n\nInstructions:\nPrepare the King Oyster Mushrooms. Start by cutting the cap off each king oyster mushroom (this is optional and only for aesthetics). Poke holes with a fork on all surfaces of the mushrooms. After poking holes, use a knife to score two sides of each mushroom.\nPrepare the Sauce. In a bowl, add fermented bean curd and mash it up well (skip if not using). Follow with soy sauces, sugar, rice cooking wine, and water. Mix well and set aside.\nCook the King Oyster Mushrooms. In a medium-sized pot, heat up vegetable oil on medium-low heat. Add ginger and garlic, and fry for another 30-60 seconds, or until smelling nice. Add doubanjiang (spicy bean paste) and slowly fry until the oil stains orange. Place the king oyster mushrooms in the pot and turn the heat up to medium. Cook the mushrooms for 2-3 minutes, turning as needed, until each side is lightly-browned. Note: You can use a heavy object to press down on the mushrooms at this point to achieve a denser, more \"meaty\" texture. Deglaze the pot with the prepared sauce, followed by the bay leaf and five-spice. Cook covered for 15 minutes.\nReduce the cooking liquid. After 15 minutes, remove the lid and turn up the heat to reduce the braising liquid. Reduce by about half, or until the liquid achieves a sauce-like coating consistency. Finish with toasted sesame oil. Remove from the heat and serve immediately.", {"entities": [[33, 42, "INGREDIENT"], [43, 55, "QUANTITY"], [56, 81, "INGREDIENT"], [84, 90, "INGREDIENT"], [91, 97, "INGREDIENT"], [106, 112, "INGREDIENT"], [120, 141, "INGREDIENT"], [142, 157, "QUANTITY"], [158, 169, "INGREDIENT"], [182, 187, "INGREDIENT"], [189, 201, "QUANTITY"], [202, 217, "INGREDIENT"], [218, 230, "QUANTITY"], [231, 245, "INGREDIENT"], [263, 272, "INGREDIENT"], [295, 302, "QUANTITY"], [303, 308, "INGREDIENT"], [309, 321, "QUANTITY"], [322, 339, "INGREDIENT"], [346, 359, "INGREDIENT"], [361, 373, "QUANTITY"], [374, 379, "INGREDIENT"], [392, 404, "QUANTITY"], [405, 422, "INGREDIENT"], [423, 435, "QUANTITY"], [436, 454, "INGREDIENT"], [534, 538, "INGREDIENT"], [551, 559, "INGREDIENT"], [650, 659, "INGREDIENT"], [715, 719, "INGREDIENT"], [720, 728, "INGREDIENT"], [760, 763, "PROCESS"], [774, 783, "INGREDIENT"], [849, 854, "INGREDIENT"], [856, 873, "INGREDIENT"], [879, 884, "INGREDIENT"], [973, 986, "INGREDIENT"], [1011, 1017, "INGREDIENT"], [1022, 1028, "INGREDIENT"], [1034, 1037, "PROCESS"], [1093, 1104, "INGREDIENT"], [1117, 1122, "INGREDIENT"], [1135, 1138, "PROCESS"], [1149, 1152, "INGREDIENT"], [1190, 1199, "INGREDIENT"], [1252, 1261, "INGREDIENT"], [1304, 1308, "INGREDIENT"], [1344, 1347, "INGREDIENT"], [1370, 1375, "PROCESS"], [1388, 1397, "INGREDIENT"], [1530, 1535, "INGREDIENT"], [1577, 1584, "PROCESS"], [1661, 1669, "PROCESS"], [1775, 1793, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
