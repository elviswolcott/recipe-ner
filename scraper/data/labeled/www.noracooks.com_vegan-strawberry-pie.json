["Ingredients:\n1 recipe Easy Vegan Pie Crust (| OR store bought vegan pie crust)\n2 pints (1 quart) strawberries (about 4 cups)\n1 cup granulated sugar\n3/4 cup water\n3 tablespoons cornstarch\n1 teaspoon lemon juice\nOptional: Coconut Whip Cream (| I used SoDelicious Coco Whip)\n\nInstructions:\nBake the pie crust: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. If using my pie crust recipe, prepare the crust according to instructions and line a 9 inch pie pan with the crust, trimming the edges as needed. Poke all over the bottom with a fork and bake for 15-20 minutes. If worried about the crust puffing up, you can place a piece of parchment paper inside the crust and put about 1 cup of dried beans or rice on top. Let cool for 10 minutes.\nMeanwhile, wash and hull the strawberries. Slice if desired (I left them whole).\nTake 3/4 cup of the strawberries and add to a saucepan. Mash them with a fork or potato masher, then stir in the sugar, water, cornstarch and lemon juice. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently, and cook for 2-3 minutes until thickened. Remove from heat.\nPlace the rest of the strawberries in the cooked pie crust, pointy side up (for prettiness!). You will probably have 2 layers of strawberries; simply arrange them fairly evenly.\nPour the thickened strawberry sauce into the pie pan with the strawberries, evenly distributing the sauce over the berries.\nChill in the refrigerator for 4-6 hours before serving. The pie will thicken and become sliceable. Serve with a dollop of Coconut Whip Cream if desired and enjoy!", {"entities": [[49, 61, "INGREDIENT"], [79, 86, "QUANTITY"], [88, 95, "QUANTITY"], [97, 109, "INGREDIENT"], [117, 123, "QUANTITY"], [125, 130, "QUANTITY"], [131, 147, "INGREDIENT"], [148, 155, "QUANTITY"], [156, 161, "INGREDIENT"], [162, 175, "QUANTITY"], [176, 186, "INGREDIENT"], [187, 197, "QUANTITY"], [198, 209, "INGREDIENT"], [261, 270, "INGREDIENT"], [527, 531, "PROCESS"], [594, 597, "INGREDIENT"], [598, 603, "PROCESS"], [662, 667, "QUANTITY"], [686, 690, "INGREDIENT"], [753, 765, "INGREDIENT"], [810, 817, "QUANTITY"], [825, 837, "INGREDIENT"], [842, 845, "PROCESS"], [886, 892, "INGREDIENT"], [906, 910, "PROCESS"], [918, 923, "INGREDIENT"], [925, 930, "INGREDIENT"], [932, 942, "INGREDIENT"], [947, 959, "INGREDIENT"], [971, 975, "PROCESS"], [977, 985, "PROCESS"], [1002, 1006, "PROCESS"], [1029, 1038, "PROCESS"], [1080, 1092, "INGREDIENT"], [1100, 1106, "INGREDIENT"], [1187, 1199, "INGREDIENT"], [1245, 1254, "PROCESS"], [1298, 1310, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
