["Ingredients:\n1/2 cup melted vegan butter\n3/4 cup brown sugar\n1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n3 tablespoons almond milk (soy or coconut milk fine)\n1 3/4 cups all purpose flour\n1/2 teaspoon baking powder\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n1 1/4 cups vegan chocolate chips (I used mini chocolate chips)\n10 ounces vegan marshmallows (I used Trader Joes brand)\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line an 8 x 8 inch pan with parchment paper.\nIn a large bowl, whisk together the melted vegan butter, brown sugar, vanilla and almond milk until smooth. Now add the flour, baking powder and salt and mix with a large wooden spoon until combined.\nAdd 2/3 of the cookie dough into the pan and push it down evenly with your hands. (If it sticks, wet your hands slightly as needed.)\nSprinkle 1 cup of the chocolate chips on top of the cookie dough (leave 1/4 cup for the top). Now add the marshmallows, evenly, on top of the chocolate chips.\nSprinkle the rest of the cookie dough on top, as well as the rest of the chocolate chips.\nBake for 25 minutes until golden brown. May also broil for just a couple of minutes to make the marshmallows even more toasty, but watch closely so it doesn&#x27;t burn! Let cool for 10 minutes or so before slicing and serving.
