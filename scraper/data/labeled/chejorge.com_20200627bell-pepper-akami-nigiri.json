["Ingredients:\n2 medium -sized red bell peppers\n1 teaspoon wasasbi (for nigiri)\n1 cup Japanese short-grained white rice, cooked\n1/2 tablespoon rice vinegar\n1 teaspoon Sugar\n1 clove garlic, finely minced\n1/4 cup kombu dashi\n3 tablespoons soy sauce\n1 tablespoon sesame oil\n1 tablespoon mirin\n1 sheet dried nori, torn into large pieces\n\nInstructions:\nRoast the Bell Peppers. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. First, Penetrate the top of the bell pepper with a meat fork and use a gas stovetop or a blowtorch to blacken the surfaces of the bell peppers. The skins don't have to be completely black, just partly (Optional: Once the bell peppers are blackened, wrap them in plastic wrap to trap the heat, which creates steam that will help release the skin. After 5 minutes in the plastic wrap, unwrap them). Place the blackened bell peppers onto a parchment-lined baking tray, and roast the bell peppers until blistered and shriveled, around 15 minutes.\nCut the Bell Peppers into Akami-like strips. After the Bell Peppers are roasted, let them rest for 15 minutes. After resting, start by cutting off the stem and removing the seeds. Then, cut the bell peppers into Akami-like strips. Be sure to remove the waxy part on the underside of the bell peppers.\nPrepare the Marinade. In a pot, combine all the marinade ingredients. Bring it to a boil and pour it into a bowl. While the marinade is still hot, place the prepared bell pepper slices in. Let this marinate overnight.\nPrepare the Sushi Rice. Take some freshly steamed rice and place it into a bowl. Add the rice vinegar and sugar and mix well \u00e2\u20ac\u201d do this while the rice is still hot so the sugar will melt. To shape the rice, dampen your hands with water and shape the rice into ovals. I also prepare sushi rice in a similar fashion in my Watermelon Sushi Recipe.\nMake the Nigiri.
