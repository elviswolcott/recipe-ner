["Ingredients:\n1 Recipe Vegan Steak\n1/2 cup orange juice (fresh squeezed is best)\n4 cloves garlic, minced\n2 tablespoons fresh lime juice (from about 2 limes)\n1 cup chopped cilantro\n1  jalape\u00c3\u00b1o, minced, seeds removed for less heat\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n1/4 cup olive oil\n2 tablespoons white vinegar\ncorn or flour tortillas\nchopped white onion\nchopped cilantro\nvegan cheese shreds\nVegan Sour Cream\n\nInstructions:\nMake the seitan steak, but do not make the marinade with the recipe. Instead, use this carne asada marinade.\nIn a large ziplock type bag (wash and reuse after to reduce waste), add all marinade ingredients. Alternatively, use a container with a lid.\nOnce the steaks have steamed, cut them up into slices and add to the bag with the marinade.\nSeal and squish the bag around to coat. Let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, overnight preferred, in the refrigerator.\nHeat a grill pan or cast iron pan over medium-high heat. Place the marinaded seitan steak pieces in the pan, saving the excess marinade. Cook for a few minutes on each side, until a bit blackened. Add a little more marinade right before removing from the pan, for extra flavor.\nRemove from heat and serve in corn or flour tortillas with toppings of choice. I like chopped white onion, chopped cilantro and crumbled vegan feta (not traditional, but Violife&#39;s vegan feta reminds me of cotja cheese!)
