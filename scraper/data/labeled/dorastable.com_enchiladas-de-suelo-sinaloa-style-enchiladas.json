["Ingredients:\n1 pkg. Extra Firm Tofu ((14oz.))\n1-2 tsp. Salt\n2 tbsp. Nutritional yeast\n1 tsp. Garlic powder\n1 tbsp. Apple Cider vinegar\n  Lime (juiced)\n5  Chiles ancho (destemmed, deseeded)\n1 clove Garlic\n1/4  White onion\n1/2 tsp. Oregano\n1/4 tsp. Cumin\n1 tsp. White vinegar\n1.5 cups Chile water, (leftover from cooking)\n2 cups Diced zucchini\n12 oz. Soy Chorizo\n1 cup Vegetable oil\n12  Tortillas\n1 cup Tofu Queso fresco\n2 cups Shredded lettuce\n4  Radishes (sliced)\n1  Avocado (sliced)\n\nInstructions:\nTo make the queso fresco: Press tofu for 30 min. Crumble tofu into a bowl and add the salt, nutritional yeast, lime juice, and garlic powder. Using your hand mix well. Let sit overnight.\nTo make the sauce: bring a medium pot, filled with water, to a boil. Add zucchini and let cook for 2-3 minutes or until it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slightly tender. Remove the zucchini with a strainer, and set aside.\nIn the same boiling water drop the chiles and simmer slowly for 7 minutes. Strain the chiles, but save 1.5 cups of the chile water.\nPlace the soaked chiles, onion, garlic, cumin, oregano, white vinegar, and chile water in the blender. Process until smooth. Season to taste with salt. Set aside.\nTo make the enchiladas: heat a large saut\u00c3\u00a9 pan to medium heat and add the chorizo, cook stirring often for 4-5 minutes until the chorizo is golden brown. Remove the chorizo from the pan and set it aside.\nHeat the pan you cooked the chorizo in, to low heat, and pour in the enchilada sauce. Bring to a simmer and turn off.\nHeat the vegetable oil in a separate saut\u00c3\u00a9 pan to 350F. Dip one of the tortillas in the enchilada sauce, make sure both sides are covered in sauce. Take this tortilla and drop it in the oil. Almost immediately flip the tortilla, then quickly remove it from the oil. Place it on the plate. (You must do this quickly or the tortilla will get soggy and fall apart). Repeat this process with the rest of the tortillas.\nTo assemble the enchiladas: top the tortillas with the chorizo, add the cooked zucchini, shredded, lettuce, sliced radishes, queso fresco, and avocado. Serve immediately.", {"entities": [[31, 35, "INGREDIENT"], [38, 42, "QUANTITY"], [48, 53, "QUANTITY"], [55, 59, "INGREDIENT"], [60, 66, "QUANTITY"], [68, 85, "INGREDIENT"], [86, 91, "QUANTITY"], [93, 106, "INGREDIENT"], [107, 113, "QUANTITY"], [127, 134, "INGREDIENT"], [209, 220, "INGREDIENT"], [221, 228, "QUANTITY"], [230, 237, "INGREDIENT"], [238, 245, "QUANTITY"], [253, 258, "QUANTITY"], [260, 273, "INGREDIENT"], [283, 295, "INGREDIENT"], [311, 318, "PROCESS"], [320, 326, "QUANTITY"], [327, 341, "INGREDIENT"], [342, 347, "QUANTITY"], [361, 366, "QUANTITY"], [367, 380, "INGREDIENT"], [395, 400, "QUANTITY"], [401, 418, "INGREDIENT"], [419, 425, "QUANTITY"], [426, 442, "INGREDIENT"], [531, 535, "INGREDIENT"], [556, 560, "INGREDIENT"], [577, 580, "PROCESS"], [585, 589, "INGREDIENT"], [591, 608, "INGREDIENT"], [610, 620, "INGREDIENT"], [626, 639, "INGREDIENT"], [657, 660, "PROCESS"], [737, 742, "INGREDIENT"], [749, 753, "PROCESS"], [776, 780, "PROCESS"], [894, 907, "INGREDIENT"], [1007, 1012, "INGREDIENT"], [1024, 1030, "INGREDIENT"], [1039, 1044, "INGREDIENT"], [1046, 1052, "INGREDIENT"], [1054, 1059, "INGREDIENT"], [1061, 1068, "INGREDIENT"], [1070, 1083, "INGREDIENT"], [1095, 1100, "INGREDIENT"], [1160, 1165, "INGREDIENT"], [1244, 1247, "PROCESS"], [1261, 1265, "PROCESS"], [1266, 1274, "PROCESS"], [1399, 1405, "INGREDIENT"], [1451, 1466, "INGREDIENT"], [1509, 1522, "INGREDIENT"], [1589, 1604, "INGREDIENT"], [1687, 1690, "INGREDIENT"], [1762, 1765, "INGREDIENT"], [1980, 1983, "PROCESS"], [1988, 1994, "INGREDIENT"], [2005, 2013, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
