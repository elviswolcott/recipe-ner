["Ingredients:\n1.5-2 cups cooked Whole grain Penne or any pasto of choice\n1.5 cups broccoli florets (blanched)\n1/3 cup  raw cashews (soaked in water for atleast half an hour)\n1/3 cup water\n1 teaspoon lemon juice or apple cider vinegar\n1/4 teaspoon salt or to taste\nfew teaspoons evoo\n1-1.5 Tablespoon nutritional Yeast\n2 teaspoons dried onion flakes or 1 teaspoon onion powder\n1/2 to 1 teaspoon garlic powder\n1/2 teaspoon cayenne\n1 teaspooon paprika (to taste/color)\na generous pinch of salt\na generous pinch Rock salt/Kala namak\nYou can add Daiya cheddar or yellow mustard powder for cheddar\nToasted Bread Crumbs or Toasted Oats and rice flakes (coarsely ground.(1.5-2 Tablespoons))\n\nInstructions:\nMix the doritos spice mix or blend in grinder to get a well blended mix. Taste test and adjust.\nCook the Penne per instructions. Blanch the broccoli(cook 3-4 minutes in boiling water, then rinse in cold water).\nBlend the soaked cashews with enough water to make a smooth cream.\nAdd lemon juice, salt to taste and half of the Doritos spice mix to the cashew cream.\nYou can just toss the pasta and broccoli and serve at this point. I usually like to heat everything a bit so the spice taste comes out more and cashew cream doesnt taste raw.\nIn a pan, add 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil, heat on medium.\nAdd the broccoli and toss for a few seconds.\nAdd the pasta and the cashew cream. Mix well. Cover and let it start to bubble on low heat. (1-2 minutes).\nTaste test and adjust spices and salt and take off heat.\nMix some of the Doritos spice with bread crumbs or crumbs of toasted Oats and rice flakes.\nSprinkle the crumbs on hot pasta right before serving!", {"entities": [[17, 23, "QUANTITY"], [24, 71, "INGREDIENT"], [81, 97, "INGREDIENT"], [99, 107, "PROCESS"], [109, 116, "QUANTITY"], [118, 129, "INGREDIENT"], [131, 137, "INGREDIENT"], [141, 146, "INGREDIENT"], [173, 180, "QUANTITY"], [181, 186, "INGREDIENT"], [187, 197, "QUANTITY"], [198, 232, "INGREDIENT"], [233, 245, "QUANTITY"], [246, 262, "INGREDIENT"], [277, 281, "INGREDIENT"], [299, 316, "INGREDIENT"], [317, 328, "QUANTITY"], [329, 374, "INGREDIENT"], [382, 392, "QUANTITY"], [393, 406, "INGREDIENT"], [407, 419, "QUANTITY"], [420, 427, "INGREDIENT"], [440, 447, "INGREDIENT"], [476, 489, "INGREDIENT"], [512, 516, "INGREDIENT"], [517, 527, "INGREDIENT"], [532, 535, "INGREDIENT"], [536, 539, "PROCESS"], [557, 571, "INGREDIENT"], [623, 627, "INGREDIENT"], [632, 643, "INGREDIENT"], [666, 679, "QUANTITY"], [713, 718, "INGREDIENT"], [719, 722, "PROCESS"], [765, 768, "PROCESS"], [866, 879, "INGREDIENT"], [895, 905, "INGREDIENT"], [918, 932, "INGREDIENT"], [945, 950, "INGREDIENT"], [979, 990, "INGREDIENT"], [992, 1005, "INGREDIENT"], [1030, 1035, "INGREDIENT"], [1036, 1039, "PROCESS"], [1047, 1059, "INGREDIENT"], [1065, 1068, "INGREDIENT"], [1083, 1088, "INGREDIENT"], [1093, 1101, "INGREDIENT"], [1174, 1179, "INGREDIENT"], [1205, 1217, "INGREDIENT"], [1246, 1249, "PROCESS"], [1250, 1261, "QUANTITY"], [1262, 1284, "INGREDIENT"], [1310, 1318, "INGREDIENT"], [1355, 1360, "INGREDIENT"], [1369, 1381, "INGREDIENT"], [1487, 1491, "INGREDIENT"], [1535, 1540, "INGREDIENT"], [1546, 1558, "INGREDIENT"], [1580, 1584, "INGREDIENT"], [1589, 1600, "INGREDIENT"], [1629, 1634, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
