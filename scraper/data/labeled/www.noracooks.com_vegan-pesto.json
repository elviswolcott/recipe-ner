["Ingredients:\n3/4 cup raw cashews (or pine nuts, walnuts, sunflower seeds)\n3 cloves garlic\n2 cups fresh basil, packed\n4 tablespoons nutritional yeast\n2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/4 cup olive oil (omit for oil free)\n1/4 cup water, plus more as needed\n8 ounces uncooked pasta of choice\n\nInstructions:\nTo a food processor, add the cashews, garlic, basil, nutritional yeast, lemon juice, salt, olive oil (if using) and 1/4 cup water.

Pesto also freezes well for up to 6 months. I freeze it in an ice cube tray, then pop the cubes out and stick them in a ziplock freezer bag or container.", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 32, "INGREDIENT"], [37, 46, "INGREDIENT"], [48, 55, "INGREDIENT"], [57, 72, "INGREDIENT"], [76, 82, "INGREDIENT"], [83, 89, "INGREDIENT"], [90, 96, "QUANTITY"], [97, 116, "INGREDIENT"], [117, 130, "QUANTITY"], [131, 148, "INGREDIENT"], [149, 162, "QUANTITY"], [163, 180, "INGREDIENT"], [181, 193, "QUANTITY"], [194, 198, "INGREDIENT"], [199, 206, "QUANTITY"], [207, 216, "INGREDIENT"], [227, 230, "INGREDIENT"], [237, 244, "QUANTITY"], [245, 271, "INGREDIENT"], [272, 280, "QUANTITY"], [281, 305, "INGREDIENT"], [342, 345, "PROCESS"], [350, 357, "INGREDIENT"], [359, 365, "INGREDIENT"], [367, 372, "INGREDIENT"], [374, 391, "INGREDIENT"], [393, 404, "INGREDIENT"], [406, 410, "INGREDIENT"], [412, 421, "INGREDIENT"], [437, 444, "QUANTITY"], [445, 450, "INGREDIENT"], [474, 480, "PROCESS"], [486, 491, "INGREDIENT"], [547, 550, "INGREDIENT"], [582, 589, "QUANTITY"], [590, 595, "INGREDIENT"], [613, 618, "INGREDIENT"], [620, 624, "PROCESS"], [698, 704, "PROCESS"], [710, 715, "INGREDIENT"], [719, 728, "INGREDIENT"], [878, 881, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
