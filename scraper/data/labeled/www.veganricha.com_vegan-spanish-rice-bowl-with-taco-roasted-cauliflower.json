["Ingredients:\n1 cup white rice such as basmati, or use short grain (washed, drained, then soaked in water for 15 mins)\n1   tomato\n1/4 cup chopped onion\n1 tsp cumin\n1 tsp chili powder blend or taco seasoning ((see Recipe notes))\n1 tbsp pickled jalapeno\n1/2 tsp salt\n1 3/4 cup water\n1/4 cup chunky salsa\n2 tbsp cilantro\n1  small head of cauliflower chopped into florets\n2 tsp oil or aquafaba\n1 tbsp or more taco spice (/seasoning blend)\n1/2  garlic powder\n1/2 tsp salt\n1/2 tsp oregano\nSalsa of choice\nGuacamole\nLime juice\n\nInstructions:\nSpanish Rice: Blend the tomato, onion, cumin, chili powder, jalapeno, garlic powder until smooth and set aside.\nDrain the rice and combine with 1 3/4 cup water in a saucepan.(You can roast the drained rice in 1 tsp oil for a few mins until it starts to turn golden before adding water). Add the pureed tomato mixture, 1/2 tsp salt and mix in. (at this point you can also add some chopped bell pepper).\nCover and cook over medium-low heat for 16 to 18 minutes or until the rice is cooked through. Mix in about 1/4 cup chunky salsa and the chopped cilantro and fluff. Taste and adjust salt, flavor(add more chili powder or taco seasoning, more salsa if needed).\nRoasted Cauliflower: Drizzle oil over the cauliflower florets. Mix in well (I use my hands to rub the oil all over). You can also add other veggies to the mix such as broccoli, zucchini, sweet potato, rutabaga. Increase the spices and salt accordingly.\nMix the spices and salt in a small bowl then sprinkle all over. Toss to coat.&nbsp;Distribute the Cauliflower on a parchment lined baking sheet or baking dish.\nBake at 425 degrees F (220 deg C) for 25 mins or until the veggies are cooked through.\nServe the spanish rice with the roasted cauliflower/veggies, sprinkle of lime juice, some salsa and guacamole/avocado.&nbsp;For a hearty meal, add beans of choice. I also like a dash of black pepper over the bowl. The mix can also be made into burritos with some lettuce and refried beans.", {"entities": [[13, 18, "QUANTITY"], [19, 65, "INGREDIENT"], [89, 95, "INGREDIENT"], [99, 104, "INGREDIENT"], [122, 128, "INGREDIENT"], [129, 136, "QUANTITY"], [137, 150, "INGREDIENT"], [151, 156, "QUANTITY"], [157, 162, "INGREDIENT"], [163, 168, "QUANTITY"], [169, 205, "INGREDIENT"], [227, 233, "QUANTITY"], [234, 250, "INGREDIENT"], [251, 258, "QUANTITY"], [259, 263, "INGREDIENT"], [264, 273, "QUANTITY"], [274, 279, "INGREDIENT"], [280, 287, "QUANTITY"], [288, 300, "INGREDIENT"], [301, 307, "QUANTITY"], [308, 316, "INGREDIENT"], [334, 345, "INGREDIENT"], [346, 353, "INGREDIENT"], [359, 366, "INGREDIENT"], [367, 372, "QUANTITY"], [373, 388, "INGREDIENT"], [389, 395, "QUANTITY"], [396, 414, "INGREDIENT"], [439, 452, "INGREDIENT"], [453, 460, "QUANTITY"], [461, 465, "INGREDIENT"], [466, 473, "QUANTITY"], [474, 481, "INGREDIENT"], [482, 497, "INGREDIENT"], [508, 518, "INGREDIENT"], [558, 564, "INGREDIENT"], [566, 571, "INGREDIENT"], [573, 578, "INGREDIENT"], [580, 592, "INGREDIENT"], [604, 617, "INGREDIENT"], [656, 660, "INGREDIENT"], [678, 687, "QUANTITY"], [688, 693, "INGREDIENT"], [713, 716, "INGREDIENT"], [717, 722, "PROCESS"], [735, 739, "INGREDIENT"], [743, 748, "QUANTITY"], [749, 752, "INGREDIENT"], [806, 812, "PROCESS"], [813, 818, "INGREDIENT"], [836, 842, "INGREDIENT"], [852, 859, "QUANTITY"], [860, 864, "INGREDIENT"], [869, 872, "PROCESS"], [896, 899, "INGREDIENT"], [905, 908, "PROCESS"], [914, 933, "INGREDIENT"], [946, 950, "PROCESS"], [1006, 1010, "INGREDIENT"], [1014, 1020, "INGREDIENT"], [1043, 1050, "QUANTITY"], [1051, 1063, "INGREDIENT"], [1072, 1088, "INGREDIENT"], [1117, 1121, "INGREDIENT"], [1139, 1151, "INGREDIENT"], [1155, 1169, "INGREDIENT"], [1176, 1181, "INGREDIENT"], [1223, 1226, "INGREDIENT"], [1236, 1255, "INGREDIENT"], [1296, 1299, "INGREDIENT"], [1315, 1318, "INGREDIENT"], [1324, 1327, "PROCESS"], [1328, 1341, "INGREDIENT"], [1349, 1352, "PROCESS"], [1361, 1369, "INGREDIENT"], [1381, 1393, "INGREDIENT"], [1429, 1433, "INGREDIENT"], [1466, 1470, "INGREDIENT"], [1492, 1500, "PROCESS"], [1578, 1584, "PROCESS"], [1594, 1600, "PROCESS"], [1666, 1673, "INGREDIENT"], [1678, 1684, "PROCESS"], [1712, 1716, "INGREDIENT"], [1726, 1733, "PROCESS"], [1734, 1745, "INGREDIENT"], [1746, 1753, "INGREDIENT"], [1755, 1763, "PROCESS"], [1767, 1777, "INGREDIENT"], [1784, 1789, "INGREDIENT"], [1794, 1803, "INGREDIENT"], [1837, 1840, "PROCESS"], [1877, 1892, "INGREDIENT"], [1912, 1915, "PROCESS"], [1916, 1919, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
