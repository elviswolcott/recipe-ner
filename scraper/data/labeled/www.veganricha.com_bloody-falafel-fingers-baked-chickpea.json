["Ingredients:\n1/2 cup dry chickpeas\n1/2 cup dry split yellow peas\n1/3 cup chopped red onion\n4 cloves of garlic\n1/4 cup cilantro (packed)\n1/4 cup  parsley (packed)\n1 teaspoon salt or to taste\n1/2 teaspoon cumin powder\n1/2 teaspoon whole coriander seeds  (or coriander powder)\n1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper/ or black pepper or to taste (I also added 1/2 a Serrano chili pepper. Spice!)\n2 teaspoons oil (optional)\n1-2 Tablespoons chickpea flour\n\nInstructions:\nWash and Soak chickpeas and split peas for 2 hours or overnight (overnight for best results. you can also use Sprouted chickpeas). They should have a give when you press them. *If the chickpeas or split peas are too hard even after the soak (sometimes they are too old), blanch them in rapidly boiling water for 3 to 4 minutes. Drain and then use.\nDrain and add to food processor or blender. Add the rest of the ingredients except chickpea flour. Pulse to form a coarse mixture. If using a Blendtec or other blender, blend half the amount at a time. Transfer to bowl and add chickpea flour if the mixture is too mushy and doesn't easily stick together. Form patties or long fingers.\nStick almond halves to the fingers using chickpea flour and water paste(add a few drops of water to a teaspoon of chickpea flour). I soaked raw almonds for an hour, then peeled and halved them to use.\nBake in preheated 375 degrees F / 170c for 25 minutes or until golden brown on the outside. (Turn the tray after 15 minutes to bake evenly). Serve hot. If serving patties, serve with tahini sauce, hummus, lettuce, pickles, onions and tomatoes, as is or in a pita.\nDip the fingers in ketchup or Sriracha and serve as is or in a Sandwich with Tahini, Onions, greens and drizzle more Sriracha.", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 34, "INGREDIENT"], [35, 42, "QUANTITY"], [43, 64, "INGREDIENT"], [65, 72, "QUANTITY"], [73, 90, "INGREDIENT"], [93, 99, "INGREDIENT"], [103, 109, "INGREDIENT"], [110, 117, "QUANTITY"], [118, 126, "INGREDIENT"], [128, 134, "INGREDIENT"], [136, 143, "QUANTITY"], [145, 152, "INGREDIENT"], [154, 160, "INGREDIENT"], [162, 172, "QUANTITY"], [173, 189, "INGREDIENT"], [190, 202, "QUANTITY"], [203, 215, "INGREDIENT"], [216, 228, "QUANTITY"], [229, 250, "INGREDIENT"], [256, 272, "INGREDIENT"], [274, 286, "QUANTITY"], [287, 330, "INGREDIENT"], [339, 344, "PROCESS"], [351, 371, "INGREDIENT"], [381, 392, "QUANTITY"], [393, 396, "INGREDIENT"], [410, 423, "QUANTITY"], [424, 438, "INGREDIENT"], [468, 477, "INGREDIENT"], [488, 492, "INGREDIENT"], [551, 554, "INGREDIENT"], [573, 582, "INGREDIENT"], [618, 623, "PROCESS"], [638, 647, "INGREDIENT"], [657, 661, "INGREDIENT"], [725, 731, "PROCESS"], [748, 761, "INGREDIENT"], [812, 815, "PROCESS"], [885, 899, "INGREDIENT"], [1025, 1028, "PROCESS"], [1029, 1043, "INGREDIENT"], [1178, 1192, "INGREDIENT"], [1197, 1202, "INGREDIENT"], [1225, 1233, "INGREDIENT"], [1248, 1265, "INGREDIENT"], [1270, 1276, "INGREDIENT"], [1277, 1288, "INGREDIENT"], [1465, 1469, "PROCESS"], [1521, 1533, "INGREDIENT"], [1535, 1541, "INGREDIENT"], [1561, 1567, "INGREDIENT"], [1572, 1580, "INGREDIENT"], [1621, 1628, "INGREDIENT"], [1632, 1640, "INGREDIENT"], [1679, 1685, "INGREDIENT"], [1719, 1727, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
