["Ingredients:\n1/4 cup almond milk (use coconut milk or other non dairy milk to make nut-free)\n1 tsp apple cider vinegar\n1/2 tsp lemon juice\n1/2 cup pumpkin puree chilled  (I used canned. Chill at least for an hour)\n2 Tablespoons safflower or coconut oil or softened vegan butter (I used safflower)\n1/3 tsp salt\na pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg\n1 Tbsp maple syrup\n1 cup unbleached white flour\n1/2 cup spelt or whole wheat flour\n2.5 tsp baking powder\n1/4 tsp baking soda\n1 Tbsp chopped fresh Sage  (or 2 tsp dried)\n1/2 to 1 tsp dried thyme\nadd roasted garlic (add other herbs.)\nUse 1 to 2 Tbsp more vegan butter for flakier biscuits.\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees F / 200c. In a bowl mix almond milk, vinegar, lemon juice and let sit to curdle for 2 minutes. Add chilled pumpkin puree, oil/butter, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, maple, Mix well. In another bowl, mix the flours and baking powder and soda. Mix in the sage and thyme.\nAdd the flour mixture to the wet. Mix well. The mixture will appear dry at first. Get your hands in there if needed to make a soft somewhat sticky dough. Add more non dairy milk or flour if needed, do not over-mix or knead.\nPat the dough onto parchment to about a 1/2-3/4 inch thick. Use a little flour if needed if the dough is sticky. Cut the biscuits using a 2 inch cookie cutter or biscuit cutter. Place on parchment, push the center a little with a finger to make an indent, brush safflower/coconut/melted vegan butter on top.\nBake for 12 to 13 minutes. Let cool for 2 minutes or so as the biscuits will still be cooking on the inside. Serve warm with a dollop of vegan butter or jam or gravy. Cool completely and refrigerate in air tight container until ready to use. Warm in the oven before serving.\nOr serve with the morning scramble", {"entities": [[17, 32, "INGREDIENT"], [38, 74, "INGREDIENT"], [93, 98, "QUANTITY"], [99, 118, "INGREDIENT"], [119, 126, "QUANTITY"], [127, 138, "INGREDIENT"], [139, 146, "QUANTITY"], [147, 168, "INGREDIENT"], [178, 184, "INGREDIENT"], [214, 227, "QUANTITY"], [228, 277, "INGREDIENT"], [286, 295, "INGREDIENT"], [297, 309, "INGREDIENT"], [318, 329, "INGREDIENT"], [334, 340, "INGREDIENT"], [341, 347, "QUANTITY"], [348, 359, "INGREDIENT"], [360, 365, "QUANTITY"], [366, 388, "INGREDIENT"], [389, 396, "QUANTITY"], [397, 423, "INGREDIENT"], [432, 445, "INGREDIENT"], [446, 453, "QUANTITY"], [454, 465, "INGREDIENT"], [466, 472, "QUANTITY"], [473, 491, "INGREDIENT"], [497, 502, "QUANTITY"], [517, 522, "QUANTITY"], [523, 534, "INGREDIENT"], [535, 538, "PROCESS"], [539, 546, "PROCESS"], [547, 553, "INGREDIENT"], [555, 558, "PROCESS"], [565, 570, "INGREDIENT"], [582, 588, "QUANTITY"], [589, 628, "INGREDIENT"], [696, 699, "PROCESS"], [700, 712, "INGREDIENT"], [713, 720, "INGREDIENT"], [722, 733, "INGREDIENT"], [775, 796, "INGREDIENT"], [798, 801, "INGREDIENT"], [802, 808, "INGREDIENT"], [810, 814, "INGREDIENT"], [816, 824, "INGREDIENT"], [826, 832, "INGREDIENT"], [834, 839, "INGREDIENT"], [868, 871, "PROCESS"], [887, 900, "INGREDIENT"], [922, 926, "INGREDIENT"], [931, 936, "INGREDIENT"], [946, 951, "INGREDIENT"], [1101, 1115, "INGREDIENT"], [1119, 1124, "INGREDIENT"], [1148, 1151, "PROCESS"], [1155, 1160, "PROCESS"], [1235, 1240, "INGREDIENT"], [1424, 1433, "INGREDIENT"], [1434, 1441, "INGREDIENT"], [1442, 1461, "INGREDIENT"], [1520, 1525, "INGREDIENT"], [1556, 1563, "PROCESS"], [1607, 1619, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
