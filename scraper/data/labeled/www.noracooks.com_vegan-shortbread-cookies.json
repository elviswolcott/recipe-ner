["Ingredients:\n2 1/2 cups all purpose flour\n3/4 cup powdered sugar\n1 1/4 cups vegan butter, softened\n1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 325 degrees F and line two baking sheets with\u00c2\u00a0parchment paper.\nIn a large bowl, stir the flour and powdered sugar together. Now add the softened butter and vanilla and mix with a hand mixer on low-medium speed until blended well. The dough will look crumbly and soft but should smush together when squeezed in your hands.\nPlace a sheet of parchment paper on your countertop and sprinkle with a little flour, then form the dough into a ball and place in the middle of the parchment paper.\nUse another piece of parchment paper for the top, sprinkling a little flour on top of the dough to prevent sticking, and roll the dough to about 1/3-1/2 of an inch thick. Cut into desired shapes (I used a small rounded cookie cutter) and place on the prepared baking sheets.\nContinue re-rolling the dough until it is all used. Bake in the oven for 12-15 minutes, until the bottom is just slightly golden. Let cool for 10 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack. Store in an airtight container for 5-6 days.", {"entities": [[13, 23, "QUANTITY"], [24, 41, "INGREDIENT"], [42, 49, "QUANTITY"], [50, 64, "INGREDIENT"], [65, 75, "QUANTITY"], [76, 98, "INGREDIENT"], [99, 111, "QUANTITY"], [112, 132, "INGREDIENT"], [195, 201, "PROCESS"], [249, 253, "PROCESS"], [258, 263, "INGREDIENT"], [268, 282, "INGREDIENT"], [297, 300, "PROCESS"], [314, 320, "INGREDIENT"], [325, 332, "INGREDIENT"], [337, 340, "PROCESS"], [547, 555, "PROCESS"], [570, 575, "INGREDIENT"], [613, 618, "PROCESS"], [727, 732, "INGREDIENT"], [895, 900, "PROCESS"], [917, 923, "PROCESS"]]}]
