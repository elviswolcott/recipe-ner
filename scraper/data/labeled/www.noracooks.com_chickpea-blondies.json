["Ingredients:\n15 ounces canned chickpeas, drained and rinsed (1 1/2 cups)\n3/4 cup brown sugar\n1/3 cup creamy peanut butter\n1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n1/4 cup almond flour\n1/4 teaspoon baking soda\n1/2 teaspoon baking powder\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n3/4 cup non-dairy chocolate chips, divided\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a 8 by 8 inch pan with parchment paper.\nIn a food processor, add all the ingredients except the chocolate chips and blend until very smooth, stopping to scrape the sides as needed.\nFold in half of the chocolate chips with a spoon. Transfer to the prepared pan and spread the batter evenly. I usually wet my hands and press down gently, or use a spatula.\nSprinkle the last 1/4 cup chocolate chips on top of the batter. Bake for 25-30 minutes.\nLet them cool at least 10 minutes before serving. Enjoy! I like to store leftover bars in the refrigerator; they will last up to 1 week this way and they taste good cold. Or store in a covered container at room temperature for 2-3 days.", {"entities": [[13, 22, "QUANTITY"], [23, 59, "INGREDIENT"], [61, 71, "QUANTITY"], [73, 80, "QUANTITY"], [81, 92, "INGREDIENT"], [93, 100, "QUANTITY"], [101, 121, "INGREDIENT"], [122, 132, "QUANTITY"], [133, 153, "INGREDIENT"], [154, 161, "QUANTITY"], [162, 174, "INGREDIENT"], [175, 187, "QUANTITY"], [188, 199, "INGREDIENT"], [200, 212, "QUANTITY"], [213, 226, "INGREDIENT"], [227, 239, "QUANTITY"], [240, 244, "INGREDIENT"], [245, 252, "QUANTITY"], [253, 287, "INGREDIENT"], [407, 410, "PROCESS"], [442, 457, "INGREDIENT"], [547, 562, "INGREDIENT"], [663, 668, "PROCESS"], [718, 725, "QUANTITY"], [726, 741, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
