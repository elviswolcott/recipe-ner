["Ingredients:\n1 1/2 cup flour ((I use 1 cup Spelt/whole wheat + 1/2 cup unbleached all purpose flour) see gluten-free option in the notes)\n2 to 3 tbsp chia seeds\n1/4 tsp salt\n2 tsp baking powder\n1/4 tsp baking soda\n1 tsp spice (such as a combination of cardamom cinnamon nutmeg to preference)\n3 to 4 tbsp chopped dates (currants, raisins or other dried fruit)\n1 cup chopped carrots (heaped) ( or 1 packed up grated)\n1/3 cup maple syrup\n1/4 cup shredded coconut\n1 tbsp oil (optional)\n1/2 to 1 tsp turmeric  (or use 1/2 inch knob or peeled fresh turmeric)\n1/2 in peeled fresh ginger\n1 tsp vanilla extract\n1 to 2 tablespoons sugar for sweeter (optional)\n2 to 3 teaspoons lemon juice\n1/2 cup + 1/4 cup non dairy milk such as almond (light coconut or soy)\nchia seeds and coconut for topping\n\nInstructions:\nIn a bowl mix the dry ingredients. Fold in dates, currants or other dried fruit. Preheat the oven to 365 degrees F / 180c. Line a muffin pan and set aside.\nIn a blender combine all wet ingredients carrots through lemon juice, with 1/2 cup non dairy milk. Blend until carrots are blended but have some texture. Transfer to the dry ingredient bowl. Use 1/4 cup non dairy milk to rinse the blender out and add to the bowl. (Alternatively, mix all the wet ingredients in a bowl until sugar is combined. You will need grated carrots if not using a blender. Add 3 tbsp applesauce with the wet for additional moisture to compensate for the moisture that releases on blending the carrots)\nMix the wet and dry until just about combined. If too runny, add a few tbsp more flour. Drop the batter into muffin pan. Garnish with chia seeds and coconut.\nBake for 25 to 28 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes, then serve. Cool completely before storing(on the counter for the day, in the refrigerator for upto 5 days).", {"entities": [[13, 22, "QUANTITY"], [23, 28, "INGREDIENT"], [37, 42, "QUANTITY"], [49, 60, "INGREDIENT"], [63, 70, "QUANTITY"], [71, 99, "INGREDIENT"], [143, 149, "QUANTITY"], [150, 160, "INGREDIENT"], [161, 168, "QUANTITY"], [169, 173, "INGREDIENT"], [174, 179, "QUANTITY"], [180, 193, "INGREDIENT"], [194, 201, "QUANTITY"], [202, 213, "INGREDIENT"], [214, 219, "QUANTITY"], [220, 225, "INGREDIENT"], [252, 260, "INGREDIENT"], [261, 269, "INGREDIENT"], [270, 276, "INGREDIENT"], [297, 303, "QUANTITY"], [304, 317, "INGREDIENT"], [319, 327, "INGREDIENT"], [329, 336, "INGREDIENT"], [359, 364, "QUANTITY"], [365, 380, "INGREDIENT"], [397, 403, "INGREDIENT"], [407, 413, "INGREDIENT"], [415, 422, "QUANTITY"], [423, 434, "INGREDIENT"], [435, 442, "QUANTITY"], [443, 459, "INGREDIENT"], [460, 466, "QUANTITY"], [467, 470, "INGREDIENT"], [489, 494, "QUANTITY"], [495, 503, "INGREDIENT"], [537, 542, "INGREDIENT"], [543, 551, "INGREDIENT"], [567, 579, "INGREDIENT"], [580, 585, "QUANTITY"], [586, 601, "INGREDIENT"], [607, 620, "QUANTITY"], [621, 638, "INGREDIENT"], [655, 666, "QUANTITY"], [667, 678, "INGREDIENT"], [679, 686, "QUANTITY"], [687, 726, "INGREDIENT"], [734, 741, "INGREDIENT"], [750, 760, "INGREDIENT"], [765, 772, "INGREDIENT"], [810, 813, "PROCESS"], [843, 848, "INGREDIENT"], [850, 858, "INGREDIENT"], [997, 1004, "INGREDIENT"], [1013, 1024, "INGREDIENT"], [1031, 1038, "QUANTITY"], [1039, 1053, "INGREDIENT"], [1067, 1074, "INGREDIENT"], [1151, 1158, "QUANTITY"], [1159, 1173, "INGREDIENT"], [1203, 1206, "PROCESS"], [1236, 1239, "PROCESS"], [1280, 1285, "INGREDIENT"], [1313, 1327, "INGREDIENT"], [1356, 1362, "QUANTITY"], [1363, 1373, "INGREDIENT"], [1472, 1479, "INGREDIENT"], [1542, 1545, "PROCESS"], [1562, 1567, "INGREDIENT"], [1615, 1625, "INGREDIENT"], [1630, 1637, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
