["Ingredients:\n1/2 cup raw slivered almonds\n15 ounce can chickpeas, drained and rinsed\n2  celery ribs, diced small\n1/2 cup red grapes, halved\n1/4 cup dried cherries\n1/2 cup Vegan Mayo\n1 tablespoon lemon juice, from about 1/2 lemon\nsalt and pepper to taste\n\nInstructions:\nIn a food processor, pulse the slivered almonds a few times until crumbly, but not so much they turn into a powder or paste.\nAdd the drained and rinsed chickpeas to the food processor with the almonds, and pulse a few times until flaky. You can leave a few beans whole; you don&#x27;t want to over process and have the mixture become pasty and smooth. Just a few pulses will do.\nAdd the almond/chickpea mixture to a large bowl and mix in the celery, grapes, dried cherries, vegan mayo, lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste.\nRefrigerate until ready to serve. It will keep in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Serve on bread with lettuce, on a salad or even with crackers. Enjoy!", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 41, "INGREDIENT"], [42, 50, "QUANTITY"], [51, 84, "INGREDIENT"], [88, 94, "INGREDIENT"], [101, 106, "INGREDIENT"], [113, 120, "QUANTITY"], [121, 139, "INGREDIENT"], [140, 147, "QUANTITY"], [148, 162, "INGREDIENT"], [163, 170, "QUANTITY"], [171, 181, "INGREDIENT"], [182, 194, "QUANTITY"], [195, 228, "INGREDIENT"], [229, 233, "INGREDIENT"], [238, 244, "INGREDIENT"], [309, 316, "INGREDIENT"], [387, 392, "INGREDIENT"], [402, 430, "INGREDIENT"], [462, 469, "INGREDIENT"], [510, 513, "INGREDIENT"], [663, 671, "INGREDIENT"], [700, 703, "PROCESS"], [711, 717, "INGREDIENT"], [727, 741, "INGREDIENT"], [743, 753, "INGREDIENT"], [755, 766, "INGREDIENT"], [772, 776, "INGREDIENT"], [781, 787, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
