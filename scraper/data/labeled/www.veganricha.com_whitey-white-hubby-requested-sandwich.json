["Ingredients:\n2 cups bread flour\n2-3 cups all purpose flour\n1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil\n1  flax egg\n1 cup water\n2 teaspoons sugar\n1  packet quick rise yeast ((1.25 teaspoons))\n1 teaspoon salt\n1/4 cup orange juice\n\nInstructions:\nWarm 1/4 cup (60ml) water and add sugar and yeast to it . Mix well and keep aside for 10 minutes or until frothy.\nGrease the mixer bowl and add in 2 cups (250g) bread flour and 2 cups (250g) all purpose flour and salt. Mix well.\nAdd in the oil , orange juice, water and yeast mixture and knead for 10-12 minutes( batches of 3-4 minutes and then scrape the bowl and wait for the mixer to cool a little if too warm)\nDough should be soft and pliable and non sticky.\nPlace dough in well oiled container, covered with plastic wrap in a warm place for 1.5 hours\nPunch dough down and knead for a minute. Shape into loaf by pulling on all sides and tucking under. Use flour on hands to avoid dough sticking to hands.\nPlace loaf in well oiled bread pan and cover with a damp kitchen towel.

I usually place the cooled bread in the refrigerator for half an our before slicing with an electric knife for nice and clean slices!", {"entities": [[15, 31, "INGREDIENT"], [34, 40, "QUANTITY"], [41, 58, "INGREDIENT"], [59, 66, "QUANTITY"], [67, 89, "INGREDIENT"], [102, 113, "INGREDIENT"], [114, 125, "QUANTITY"], [126, 131, "INGREDIENT"], [142, 158, "INGREDIENT"], [178, 188, "QUANTITY"], [189, 193, "INGREDIENT"], [194, 201, "QUANTITY"], [202, 214, "INGREDIENT"], [235, 242, "QUANTITY"], [250, 255, "INGREDIENT"], [260, 263, "PROCESS"], [264, 269, "INGREDIENT"], [274, 279, "INGREDIENT"], [370, 373, "PROCESS"], [377, 383, "QUANTITY"], [385, 389, "QUANTITY"], [391, 402, "INGREDIENT"], [407, 413, "QUANTITY"], [415, 419, "QUANTITY"], [421, 438, "INGREDIENT"], [443, 448, "INGREDIENT"], [470, 473, "INGREDIENT"], [476, 488, "INGREDIENT"], [490, 495, "INGREDIENT"], [500, 505, "INGREDIENT"], [518, 523, "PROCESS"], [751, 755, "PROCESS"], [766, 771, "PROCESS"], [807, 812, "PROCESS"], [890, 895, "INGREDIENT"], [1123, 1128, "PROCESS"]]}]
