["Ingredients:\n1/2 cup non dairy yogurt (or use blended silken tofu or thick cashew cream or softened vegan cream cheese or vegan sour cream)\n3/4 cup non dairy milk\n3/4 cup or more unrefined sugar (preferably powdered)\n1 tsp vanilla extract\n3 tbsp oil\n3 tbsp lemon juice\nZest of a lemon or lime\n2 cups flour (I use 1 cup wheat or spelt flour, and 1 cup unbleached white)\n1.5 tsp baking powder\n1/4 tsp baking soda\n1/4 tsp salt\n3/4 cup blueberries tossed in 1 tbsp flour\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 365 degrees F / 180c. Line a loaf pan with parchment.\nAdd all the wet ingredients in a bowl and whisk until the sugar is well combined. 1-2 mins\nIn another bowl, whisk all the dry ingredients except blueberries. Add dry to wet and mix until just combined. Reserve 1-2 tbsp blueberries. Fold in the rest of the blueberries into the batter..\nDrop the batter into prepared pan. Distribute the remaining blueberries on top and press in lightly.\nBake for 55 to 60 minutes or until a toothpick from the center comes out clean.\nCool for 10 minutes before removing from pan. Cool completely before slicing. Frost or ice if needed. A simple glaze of lemon zest + lemon juice + sugar icing works really well.", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 37, "INGREDIENT"], [54, 65, "INGREDIENT"], [69, 87, "INGREDIENT"], [100, 138, "INGREDIENT"], [140, 147, "QUANTITY"], [148, 162, "INGREDIENT"], [163, 170, "QUANTITY"], [171, 194, "INGREDIENT"], [217, 222, "QUANTITY"], [223, 238, "INGREDIENT"], [239, 245, "QUANTITY"], [246, 249, "INGREDIENT"], [250, 256, "QUANTITY"], [257, 268, "INGREDIENT"], [293, 299, "QUANTITY"], [300, 305, "INGREDIENT"], [313, 318, "QUANTITY"], [328, 339, "INGREDIENT"], [345, 350, "QUANTITY"], [377, 390, "INGREDIENT"], [391, 398, "QUANTITY"], [399, 410, "INGREDIENT"], [411, 418, "QUANTITY"], [419, 423, "INGREDIENT"], [424, 431, "QUANTITY"], [432, 466, "INGREDIENT"], [598, 603, "PROCESS"], [614, 619, "INGREDIENT"], [664, 669, "PROCESS"], [701, 712, "INGREDIENT"], [733, 736, "PROCESS"], [768, 774, "QUANTITY"], [775, 786, "INGREDIENT"], [812, 823, "INGREDIENT"], [902, 913, "INGREDIENT"], [925, 930, "PROCESS"], [1110, 1113, "INGREDIENT"], [1140, 1153, "INGREDIENT"], [1156, 1167, "INGREDIENT"], [1170, 1175, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
