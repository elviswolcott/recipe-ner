["Ingredients:\n8 oz tempeh\n1 tbsp coriander seeds\n1/4 tsp cumin seeds\n1/3 tsp black peppercorns\n1/4 tsp fenugreek seeds\n1/8 tsp fennel seeds (optional)\n1 tbsp sesame seeds\n1/3 tsp red pepper flakes\n1  large or 2 small tomatoes  (or 1 cup diced)\n1 tsp tamarind paste (or 1 tbsp tamarind chutney or pulp from fresh tamarind, or use 1 tsp lime juice + a dash of sugar)\n2 tbsp ketchup or use 1 tsp more tamarind paste\n1/2  inch ginger\n3/4 tsp salt divided\n1 tsp oil\n1/2  medium onion (, chopped)\n4 cloves of garlic (, finely chopped)\n6 to 8  curry leaves (fresh, frozen or dried)\n1/2  tsp  smoked paprika ore regular paprika\n1 cup cauliflower florets\n1  small potato (, cubed)\n1 cup coconut milk\ncilantro and lemon for garnish\n\nInstructions:\nSteam the tempeh for 12 minutes. Set aside. (If using tofu, you can panfry it on a skillet for 4-5 mins)\nHeat a skillet over medium heat. Add coriander seeds, cumin seeds and black peppercorn. Roast for 2 mins or until fragrant. Add the fenugreek and fennel seeds and roast for half a min. Add sesame seeds and chili flakes and roast for a few seconds. Take off heat. Grind the mixture in a grinder(I use my nutribullet 2 blade grinder and use the same cup for wet blending later with the 4 blade). If you dont have a grinder, just blend everything in the next step with the tomato it will take a few minutes to break the spices down.\nBlend the ground spices with the tomato, ketchup, ginger and tamarind until smooth. Use a few tbsp of water if needed.\nHeat oil in the same skillet over medium heat. Add onion, curry leaves, garlic and a good pinch of salt and cook until translucent. Add the steamed tempeh and cook for a minute to brown some edges.\nAdd the blended tomato+ spice mixture, paprika and 1/3 tsp salt. Mix well and cook over medium heat until the sauce is drying out and sticking to the tempeh. 7 to 10 mins\nAdd the cauliflower, potato, 1/3 tsp salt and coconut milk. Mix well to incorporate, cover and cook for 11 o 13 minutes or until the veggies are cooked through and the sauce has thickened a bit. Continue to cook uncovered if the sauce is too thin or add more coconut milk for saucier.\nTaste and adjust salt, spice and flavor. Add a bit of cayenne or garam masala if needed. Garnish with cilantro and a dash of lemon. Serve with flatbread, naan or rice. As with most Indian sauces, the sauce flavor develops more on sitting for a few hours. Refrigerate for upto 3 days.&nbsp;", {"entities": [[13, 17, "QUANTITY"], [18, 24, "INGREDIENT"], [25, 31, "QUANTITY"], [32, 47, "INGREDIENT"], [48, 55, "QUANTITY"], [56, 67, "INGREDIENT"], [68, 75, "QUANTITY"], [76, 93, "INGREDIENT"], [94, 101, "QUANTITY"], [102, 117, "INGREDIENT"], [118, 125, "QUANTITY"], [126, 138, "INGREDIENT"], [150, 156, "QUANTITY"], [157, 169, "INGREDIENT"], [170, 177, "QUANTITY"], [178, 195, "INGREDIENT"], [216, 224, "INGREDIENT"], [230, 235, "QUANTITY"], [236, 241, "INGREDIENT"], [243, 248, "QUANTITY"], [249, 263, "INGREDIENT"], [268, 274, "QUANTITY"], [305, 310, "INGREDIENT"], [328, 333, "QUANTITY"], [334, 344, "INGREDIENT"], [354, 362, "INGREDIENT"], [364, 370, "QUANTITY"], [371, 411, "INGREDIENT"], [422, 428, "INGREDIENT"], [429, 436, "QUANTITY"], [437, 449, "INGREDIENT"], [450, 455, "QUANTITY"], [456, 459, "INGREDIENT"], [472, 477, "INGREDIENT"], [481, 488, "INGREDIENT"], [492, 498, "INGREDIENT"], [502, 508, "INGREDIENT"], [519, 526, "INGREDIENT"], [536, 541, "INGREDIENT"], [550, 555, "INGREDIENT"], [557, 563, "INGREDIENT"], [574, 582, "QUANTITY"], [584, 618, "INGREDIENT"], [619, 624, "QUANTITY"], [625, 644, "INGREDIENT"], [654, 660, "INGREDIENT"], [664, 669, "INGREDIENT"], [671, 676, "QUANTITY"], [677, 689, "INGREDIENT"], [690, 698, "INGREDIENT"], [746, 752, "INGREDIENT"], [790, 794, "INGREDIENT"], [800, 803, "INGREDIENT"], [878, 893, "INGREDIENT"], [895, 906, "INGREDIENT"], [987, 999, "INGREDIENT"], [1004, 1009, "PROCESS"], [1030, 1042, "INGREDIENT"], [1047, 1059, "INGREDIENT"], [1064, 1069, "PROCESS"], [1189, 1192, "QUANTITY"], [1311, 1317, "INGREDIENT"], [1381, 1387, "INGREDIENT"], [1404, 1410, "INGREDIENT"], [1412, 1419, "INGREDIENT"], [1421, 1427, "INGREDIENT"], [1470, 1478, "INGREDIENT"], [1495, 1498, "INGREDIENT"], [1541, 1546, "INGREDIENT"], [1548, 1553, "INGREDIENT"], [1562, 1568, "INGREDIENT"], [1580, 1593, "INGREDIENT"], [1598, 1602, "PROCESS"], [1630, 1637, "PROCESS"], [1638, 1644, "INGREDIENT"], [1649, 1653, "PROCESS"], [1712, 1717, "INGREDIENT"], [1727, 1734, "INGREDIENT"], [1739, 1751, "INGREDIENT"], [1766, 1770, "PROCESS"], [1838, 1844, "INGREDIENT"], [1867, 1878, "INGREDIENT"], [1880, 1886, "INGREDIENT"], [1888, 1900, "INGREDIENT"], [1905, 1917, "INGREDIENT"], [1954, 1958, "PROCESS"], [1992, 1999, "INGREDIENT"], [2004, 2010, "PROCESS"], [2037, 2046, "PROCESS"], [2066, 2070, "PROCESS"], [2101, 2105, "PROCESS"], [2109, 2112, "PROCESS"], [2118, 2130, "INGREDIENT"], [2161, 2165, "INGREDIENT"], [2167, 2172, "INGREDIENT"], [2195, 2205, "INGREDIENT"], [2209, 2221, "INGREDIENT"], [2246, 2254, "INGREDIENT"], [2306, 2310, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
