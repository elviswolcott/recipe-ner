["Ingredients:\n1 cup raw cashews\n3/4 cup water\n2 cloves garlic\n3 tablespoons lemon juice\n1 tablespoon dijon mustard\n1 tablespoon capers, drained\n1 tablespoon vegan Worcestershire sauce (optional but good)\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n6-8 cups chopped romaine, kale or a mix\nvegan croutons\nVegan Parmesan\n\nInstructions:\nSoak the raw cashew pieces in hot water for 5 minutes. I heat up water in my electric kettle and pour it over the cashews to soak.\u00c2\u00a0If you don&#x27;t have a high powered blender, you should soak them longer, several hours or overnight in order to get them very soft.\nDrain the cashews and add to your blender. Add the remaining ingredients, including 3/4 cup fresh water, and blend until very smooth.\nServe with chopped romaine/kale or a mix, with vegan croutons and optional Vegan Parmesan for a delicious Caesar Salad.
