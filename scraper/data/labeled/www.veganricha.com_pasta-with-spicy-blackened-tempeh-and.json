["Ingredients:\nTempeh strips (used about 4 oz of the flax and soy organic tempeh)\n1/2 teaspoon cajun spice\n1/2 teaspoon sea salt or to taste\n1 teaspoon ginger garlic paste\n1/4 teaspoon red chili powder or Cayenne pepper\n1/4 teaspoon black pepper or to taste\n1 teaspoon lemon juice\n2/3 cup almonds soaked for overnight (or soaked half an hour and then nuked for 1 minute 2 times in the microwave)\n3 cloves garlic\n2-3 cups cilantro\n1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste\n1  Serrano chili pepper or to taste\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n2-3 tablespoons water\n2 cups Elbows or any pasta\n1  medium tomato sliced\n\nInstructions:\nCut up the tempeh in 1/2 inch strips.\nMix in all the ingredients of the marinade and rub over the tempeh. Use more or less marinade, according to preference. Keep for atleast half an hour. Also use the spices according to taste. We like our tempeh a bit spicy.\nIn a small deep non stick pan(can use grill pan too), add some canola oil and heat at medium heat, and arrange the tempeh.\nAdd in 2/3 cup water or just about to reach the tops of the strips and cook covered on Low heat for 10-12 minutes.\nFlip the strips and cook for another 10 minutes. The water should have been absorbed by the tempeh. Keep cooking on the same pan to blacken the strips a little or grill them in any which way, for a few minutes till preferred blackened effect! Cook the tempeh right before serving so it is hot and sizzling!\nCook the pasta according to instruction and keep aside.\nFor the pesto, blend the almonds, cilantro, chili, garlic cloves, salt and olive oil into a smooth paste. Use some water if necessary.\nToss the pasta in the pesto and top it off with the hot blackened Tempeh and some tomato slices!.\nDrop some extra pesto, some chopped cilantro, chili flakes or anything you fancy on top! Quick sizzling Meal!\nOther sauces like a garlicky tomato basil, or a creamy chipotle (cashew cream+chipotle peppers) would work with the blackened Tempeh too!
