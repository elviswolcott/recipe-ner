["Ingredients:\n1 cup whole raw hazelnuts\n1 cup vegan chocolate chips*\n1-4 tablespoons powdered sugar, optional for added sweetness\n\nInstructions:\nToast the hazelnuts: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Spread the hazelnuts in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake in the oven for 10 minutes, until fragrant.\nPlace the hazelnuts in the center of a clean dish towel, then wrap them up and rub vigorously for a few minutes to remove some of the skins. They won&#x27;t all come off, and that is fine!\nAdd the still-warm hazelnuts to a high powered blender (or food processor). Blend and grind the nuts until moist, crumbly and almost a paste. Scrape down the sides as needed, I usually stop and scrape 2-3 times. This will take a little longer in a food processor (5-8 minutes) than a high powered blender (3-5 minutes).\nMelt the chocolate: In a microwave safe bowl, add the chocolate chips and microwave in 30 second intervals, stirring in between, until completely melted and smooth. You can also melt the chocolate in a double broiler.\nAdd the chocolate to the blender with the hazelnut paste. Blend until very smooth, scraping down the sides a few times as needed. Taste, and add powdered sugar if desired for additional sweetness.\nPour into a jar and store at room temperature for up to 2 weeks. If you put it in the refrigerator, the nutella will get very hard so I don&#x27;t recommend it. It may get hard even at room temperature, especially if your house is cold. If it&#x27;s too firm, warm in the microwave for 20-30 seconds and it will soften right up.", {"entities": [[13, 18, "QUANTITY"], [19, 38, "INGREDIENT"], [39, 44, "QUANTITY"], [45, 67, "INGREDIENT"], [70, 83, "QUANTITY"], [84, 128, "INGREDIENT"], [154, 163, "INGREDIENT"], [211, 220, "INGREDIENT"], [251, 257, "PROCESS"], [324, 333, "INGREDIENT"], [376, 380, "PROCESS"], [522, 531, "INGREDIENT"], [599, 603, "INGREDIENT"], [638, 643, "INGREDIENT"], [832, 841, "INGREDIENT"], [869, 872, "PROCESS"], [877, 892, "INGREDIENT"], [931, 939, "PROCESS"], [992, 995, "INGREDIENT"], [1010, 1019, "INGREDIENT"], [1049, 1058, "INGREDIENT"], [1092, 1097, "INGREDIENT"], [1182, 1185, "PROCESS"], [1186, 1200, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
