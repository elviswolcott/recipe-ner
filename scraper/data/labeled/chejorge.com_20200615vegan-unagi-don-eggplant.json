["Ingredients:\n2  Japanese or Chinese eggplants (long and slim)\n1 tablespoon vegetable oil, for frying\n1/2 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds, for garnish\n1  scallion, finely sliced\n2 tablespoons soy sauce\n2 tablespoons mirin\n2 teaspoon sake (rice wine)\n2 tablespoon dark brown sugar\n\nInstructions:\nPrepare the Eggplants. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (204 degrees C). First, poke holes with a toothpick or a fork all around the eggplant \u00e2\u20ac\u201d this will help the eggplant skin release after roasting. Roast the eggplants whole (without peeling) until their skins are blistered and the inside feels just soft, about 30-45 minutes depending on the size of the eggplant. Alternatively, you can microwave the eggplants to achieve a similar result. Place them on a microwave-safe plate, then cover with kitchen towel or a microwave cover and microwave until soft, about 5 minutes.\nPrepare Unagi Sauce. While the eggplants are roasting, prepare the unagi sauce by simply combining soy sauce, mirin, sake (rice wine), and brown sugar. Set aside.\nFinish the Eggplants. When the eggplants are cooled down enough, peel the skins off carefully. Do 1 long incision to open up the eggplant, then do 1-2 more incisions to help flatten (if needed).\nGlaze Eggplants. In a pan, heat ~1 tablespoon vegetable oil over high heat. Add the peeled eggplant (no-seed side down) and sear until beautifully charred on one side. Flip, and add the prepared sauce to glaze the eggplants. Reduce the sauce to a coating consistency while basting the eggplants with it. Once ready, serve immediately over freshly steamed white rice. Garnish with toasted sesame seeds and sliced scallions.", {"entities": [[62, 74, "QUANTITY"], [75, 100, "INGREDIENT"], [101, 113, "QUANTITY"], [114, 147, "INGREDIENT"], [175, 188, "QUANTITY"], [189, 198, "INGREDIENT"], [199, 212, "QUANTITY"], [213, 218, "INGREDIENT"], [219, 229, "QUANTITY"], [230, 234, "INGREDIENT"], [236, 245, "INGREDIENT"], [247, 259, "QUANTITY"], [260, 276, "INGREDIENT"], [486, 494, "PROCESS"], [682, 685, "INGREDIENT"], [916, 924, "PROCESS"], [970, 980, "INGREDIENT"], [981, 986, "INGREDIENT"], [988, 992, "INGREDIENT"], [994, 1003, "INGREDIENT"], [1010, 1021, "INGREDIENT"], [1275, 1288, "INGREDIENT"], [1353, 1357, "PROCESS"], [1407, 1410, "PROCESS"], [1576, 1583, "PROCESS"], [1584, 1594, "INGREDIENT"], [1609, 1629, "INGREDIENT"], [1641, 1650, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
