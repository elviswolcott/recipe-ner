["Ingredients:\n7 ounces stir fry rice noodles\n2-3 tablespoons vegetable oil\n16 ounce block extra-firm tofu, pressed and cut into 1/2 inch cubes\n4 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce\n2 tablespoons rice vinegar\n4 tablespoons pure maple syrup\n2 tablespoons fresh lime juice\n1 teaspoon Sriracha hot sauce\n1 cup julienne sliced carrots, about 3 carrots\n3  green onions, chopped\n2   limes, cut into wedges\n1/2 cup cilantro, chopped\n1/2 cup crushed or chopped peanuts\n1 cup mung bean sprouts, optional\n\nInstructions:\nPrepare all of your ingredients before you begin. Slice the carrots, chop the green onions, cilantro and the peanuts. Press your tofu if needed (I like to get the vacuum packed extra-firm tofu so no need to press it), and then chop into 1/2 inch cubes.\nCook the noodles: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the noodles and cook for 1 minute. Remove from heat, and let them soak for 5 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water. Set aside.\nMake the sauce: Stir all the sauce ingredients together in a small bowl. Set aside.\nFry the tofu: In a large pan (you can even use the same pot you boiled the noodles in), heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the tofu, and fry it until all sides are golden brown.\nTo the pan with the tofu, add the noodles, sauce, carrots, green onions and half of the cilantro. Stir as it warms up.&nbsp;\nServe immediately, sprinkling peanuts and more cilantro on the top of each serving, with lime wedges and mung bean sprouts on the side. Squeeze lime juice to taste before eating.
