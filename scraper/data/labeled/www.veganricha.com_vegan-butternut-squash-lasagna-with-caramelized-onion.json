Then top it with some vegan mozzarella and vegan parmesan and pepper flakes.\nDrizzle another 1/4 cup of water around the edges of the noodles. Then cover the dish with a foil and bake at 350 degrees F (180 c) for about an hour.\nLet the lasagna sit for another 10 minutes then open the foil and serve.
