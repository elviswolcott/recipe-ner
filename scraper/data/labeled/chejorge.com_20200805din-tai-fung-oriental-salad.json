["Ingredients:\n1 large sheet dried kombu\n40 grams dried vermicelli noodles\n100 grams bean curd\n100 grams fresh bean sprouts\n4 tablespoons light soy sauce\n4 tablespoons white rice vinegar\n2 tablespoons sesame oil\n1 tablespoon chili oil (homemade recipe HERE)\n1 tablespoon sugar\n\nInstructions:\nPrepare the Kombu. To prepare the Kombu, start by bringing around 1 Liter of water to boil in a pot. Place the Kombu pieces in (you may want to cut them up so they can be fully submerged) and lower the heat to a simmer. Simmer for around 30 minutes, or until Kombu is soft but not rubbery. Remove from pot and slice into thin long strips. Set aside. Note: reserve the cooking liquid, which becomes Kombu dashi broth.\nPrepare the Vermicelli Noodles. Do as the package instructions \u00e2\u20ac\u201d usually this involves soaking in room temperature water (around 10 minutes) and boiling in water (around 2-3 minutes). Strain the noodles and set aside.\nPrepare the Bean Sprouts. In the same pot of boiling water, blanch the fresh bean sprouts for just 1-2 minutes. Be sure not to overcook them \u00e2\u20ac\u201d they should still be crunchy. Strain and set aside.\nPrepare the Bean Curd. Sliced the bean curd into thin long strips. In the same pot of boiling water, blanch the bean curd for 1 minute. Carefully strain (they are fragile) and set aside.\u00c2\u00a0Note: blanch this last as it releases oil & makes your water oily.\nAssembly. In a large bowl, combine the kombu, vermicelli noodles, bean sprouts and bean curd. Add soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, chili oil, and sugar. Gently toss to combine. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for an hour before serving.", {"entities": [[33, 38, "INGREDIENT"], [39, 47, "QUANTITY"], [48, 72, "INGREDIENT"], [73, 82, "QUANTITY"], [83, 92, "INGREDIENT"], [93, 102, "QUANTITY"], [103, 121, "INGREDIENT"], [122, 135, "QUANTITY"], [136, 151, "INGREDIENT"], [152, 165, "QUANTITY"], [166, 184, "INGREDIENT"], [185, 198, "QUANTITY"], [199, 209, "INGREDIENT"], [210, 222, "QUANTITY"], [223, 232, "INGREDIENT"], [256, 268, "QUANTITY"], [269, 274, "INGREDIENT"], [364, 372, "INGREDIENT"], [376, 380, "PROCESS"], [454, 457, "INGREDIENT"], [611, 615, "PROCESS"], [658, 665, "PROCESS"], [700, 705, "INGREDIENT"], [807, 829, "INGREDIENT"], [854, 861, "PROCESS"], [865, 870, "INGREDIENT"], [972, 985, "INGREDIENT"], [987, 993, "PROCESS"], [998, 1016, "INGREDIENT"], [1147, 1153, "INGREDIENT"], [1158, 1167, "INGREDIENT"], [1173, 1177, "PROCESS"], [1210, 1223, "INGREDIENT"], [1225, 1231, "PROCESS"], [1236, 1245, "INGREDIENT"], [1318, 1324, "PROCESS"], [1350, 1353, "INGREDIENT"], [1367, 1372, "INGREDIENT"], [1418, 1423, "INGREDIENT"], [1425, 1443, "INGREDIENT"], [1445, 1457, "INGREDIENT"], [1462, 1471, "INGREDIENT"], [1477, 1487, "INGREDIENT"], [1488, 1500, "INGREDIENT"], [1502, 1512, "INGREDIENT"], [1514, 1523, "INGREDIENT"], [1529, 1534, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
