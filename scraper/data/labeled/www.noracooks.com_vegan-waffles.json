["Ingredients:\n1/4 cup ground flaxseeds\n1/2  cup water\n3 1/2 cups soy milk\n2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar\n2 cups all purpose flour\n1 1/2 cups whole wheat pastry flour\n2 tablespoons baking powder\n1 teaspoon salt\n1/3 cup granulated sugar\n1/2 cup melted coconut oil\n2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.\nMake the Flax Eggs: In a small bowl, combine the ground flax and water. Stir, and set aside to thicken.\nMake the Vegan Buttermilk: If your milk is cold, warm it for a minute in the microwave, otherwise it will cause the coconut oil to harden in the batter. In a large measuring cup or bowl, measure 3 1/2 cups of soy milk. Add the apple cider vinegar, stir a little with a spoon and set aside to curdle.\u00c2\u00a0\nIn a large bowl, whisk together the flours, baking powder, salt and sugar.&nbsp;\nAdd the flax eggs, vegan buttermilk, melted coconut oil and vanilla to the dry ingredients. Stir until just combined with a large wooden spoon, being careful not to over mix. The batter should be fairly thick, if it's too runny add a few tablespoons more of flour. If it's too thick, add a little more water.\nSpray waffle iron with oil (unless your waffle iron is non-stick). Pour the recommended amount of batter onto hot waffle iron, and cook until the waffle is golden brown on both sides.\nServe immediately, or keep in a warm oven (200 degrees F) until ready to serve. Top with fresh berries, coconut whip, vegan butter, maple syrup and anything else you desire!", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 37, "INGREDIENT"], [38, 46, "QUANTITY"], [47, 52, "INGREDIENT"], [53, 63, "QUANTITY"], [64, 72, "INGREDIENT"], [73, 86, "QUANTITY"], [87, 106, "INGREDIENT"], [107, 113, "QUANTITY"], [114, 131, "INGREDIENT"], [132, 142, "QUANTITY"], [143, 167, "INGREDIENT"], [168, 181, "QUANTITY"], [182, 195, "INGREDIENT"], [196, 206, "QUANTITY"], [207, 211, "INGREDIENT"], [212, 219, "QUANTITY"], [220, 236, "INGREDIENT"], [237, 244, "QUANTITY"], [245, 263, "INGREDIENT"], [264, 275, "QUANTITY"], [276, 296, "INGREDIENT"], [423, 434, "INGREDIENT"], [439, 444, "INGREDIENT"], [513, 517, "INGREDIENT"], [594, 605, "INGREDIENT"], [652, 655, "QUANTITY"], [673, 683, "QUANTITY"], [687, 695, "INGREDIENT"], [705, 724, "INGREDIENT"], [726, 730, "PROCESS"], [797, 802, "PROCESS"], [824, 837, "INGREDIENT"], [839, 843, "INGREDIENT"], [898, 916, "INGREDIENT"], [921, 928, "INGREDIENT"], [1031, 1034, "PROCESS"], [1089, 1092, "PROCESS"], [1116, 1124, "INGREDIENT"], [1145, 1148, "PROCESS"], [1163, 1168, "INGREDIENT"], [1193, 1196, "INGREDIENT"], [1301, 1305, "PROCESS"], [1443, 1448, "INGREDIENT"], [1458, 1465, "INGREDIENT"], [1472, 1484, "INGREDIENT"], [1486, 1497, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
