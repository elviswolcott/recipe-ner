I heat up water in my electric kettle and pour it over the cashews to soak.\nDrain the cashews, discard the water and add them to a high powered blender. Now add the lemon juice, apple cider vinegar, salt and 3/4 cup fresh water. Blend until very smooth.\nStore in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
