The apple will make the dougg more moist with time, so try to keep the dough a little on the dry side.\nPlace dough in well oiled container covered for 1.5 hours.\nPunch it down and knead for a minute. Shape dough into a loaf by pulling on all sides and tucking under.\nPlace in bread pan, cover with kitchen towe and let rise for another 40 minutes.\nBake at 375 degrees F for 45-50 minutes or until nice a brown and sounds hollow.\nBread will have a nice dark crumb, which will be a bit hard right out of the oven, but will soften as the bread cools. Slice after the loaf has cooled completely.&nbsp;", {"entities": [[15, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 32, "INGREDIENT"], [33, 38, "QUANTITY"], [39, 56, "INGREDIENT"], [70, 116, "INGREDIENT"], [142, 155, "QUANTITY"], [156, 172, "INGREDIENT"], [173, 184, "QUANTITY"], [185, 195, "INGREDIENT"], [196, 209, "QUANTITY"], [210, 236, "INGREDIENT"], [237, 250, "QUANTITY"], [251, 267, "INGREDIENT"], [268, 280, "QUANTITY"], [281, 289, "INGREDIENT"], [290, 300, "QUANTITY"], [301, 305, "INGREDIENT"], [306, 318, "QUANTITY"], [319, 331, "INGREDIENT"], [332, 348, "INGREDIENT"], [349, 356, "QUANTITY"], [357, 362, "INGREDIENT"], [387, 392, "INGREDIENT"], [397, 400, "PROCESS"], [401, 406, "INGREDIENT"], [482, 487, "INGREDIENT"], [489, 494, "INGREDIENT"], [499, 507, "INGREDIENT"], [535, 538, "PROCESS"], [539, 545, "QUANTITY"], [547, 551, "QUANTITY"], [553, 564, "INGREDIENT"], [566, 571, "QUANTITY"], [573, 577, "QUANTITY"], [579, 596, "INGREDIENT"], [598, 602, "INGREDIENT"], [604, 613, "INGREDIENT"], [618, 621, "PROCESS"], [639, 644, "INGREDIENT"], [674, 680, "INGREDIENT"], [685, 695, "INGREDIENT"], [700, 705, "PROCESS"], [779, 784, "INGREDIENT"], [788, 793, "INGREDIENT"], [985, 990, "PROCESS"]]}]
