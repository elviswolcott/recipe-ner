Line a baking sheet. In a large bowl, mix the flour, almond flour, baking powder, baking soda and whisk well. Add the sugar, pecans, salt and spice and mix in.\nAdd the chilled coconut cream and cut with a fork to mix in. Add the pumpkin and continue to cut with the fork. The mixture will initially feel very dry and then start to come become fat crumbs and dough like. Add another tbsp of coconut cream if needed. Once there isnt much dry flour left, bring it together with a spatula or your hands quickly and shape into a fat disc, atleast 3/4 inch tall. Slice into 6 to 8 triangles using a pizza cutter.\nPlace on baking sheet and bake for 16 to 17 minutes.\nMeanwhile make the glaze: Cook all the ingredients in a small skillet over medium heat until the mixture thickens. Taste adjust flavor, salt. Add a few drops of vanilla extract for a vanilla pumpkin spice glaze. Let it cool for a few minutes before drizzling on the warm scones. Sprinkle chopped pecans on top (optional). Serve warm as is or with some vegan butter. You can also use a simple sugar icing or a maple sugar glaze.", {"entities": [[13, 19, "QUANTITY"], [20, 25, "INGREDIENT"], [35, 40, "QUANTITY"], [41, 52, "INGREDIENT"], [57, 62, "QUANTITY"], [82, 88, "QUANTITY"], [89, 101, "INGREDIENT"], [110, 123, "INGREDIENT"], [124, 131, "QUANTITY"], [132, 143, "INGREDIENT"], [144, 151, "QUANTITY"], [152, 166, "INGREDIENT"], [167, 174, "QUANTITY"], [175, 186, "INGREDIENT"], [188, 194, "INGREDIENT"], [216, 221, "INGREDIENT"], [226, 229, "PROCESS"], [230, 236, "QUANTITY"], [237, 245, "INGREDIENT"], [273, 278, "QUANTITY"], [279, 296, "INGREDIENT"], [297, 309, "QUANTITY"], [310, 314, "INGREDIENT"], [315, 322, "QUANTITY"], [323, 359, "INGREDIENT"], [372, 375, "INGREDIENT"], [431, 437, "QUANTITY"], [449, 456, "QUANTITY"], [457, 470, "INGREDIENT"], [514, 526, "INGREDIENT"], [529, 541, "QUANTITY"], [542, 557, "INGREDIENT"], [558, 565, "QUANTITY"], [566, 579, "INGREDIENT"], [580, 587, "QUANTITY"], [588, 600, "INGREDIENT"], [650, 653, "INGREDIENT"], [655, 662, "QUANTITY"], [663, 668, "INGREDIENT"], [669, 676, "QUANTITY"], [677, 681, "INGREDIENT"], [682, 689, "QUANTITY"], [690, 707, "INGREDIENT"], [761, 767, "PROCESS"], [792, 795, "PROCESS"], [800, 805, "INGREDIENT"], [807, 819, "INGREDIENT"], [821, 834, "INGREDIENT"], [836, 847, "INGREDIENT"], [852, 857, "PROCESS"], [872, 877, "INGREDIENT"], [879, 886, "INGREDIENT"], [887, 891, "INGREDIENT"], [896, 901, "INGREDIENT"], [906, 909, "PROCESS"], [930, 943, "INGREDIENT"], [967, 970, "PROCESS"], [983, 990, "INGREDIENT"], [1141, 1157, "INGREDIENT"], [1194, 1199, "INGREDIENT"], [1370, 1376, "PROCESS"], [1387, 1391, "PROCESS"], [1550, 1555, "INGREDIENT"], [1572, 1590, "INGREDIENT"], [1597, 1604, "INGREDIENT"], [1605, 1618, "INGREDIENT"], [1702, 1716, "INGREDIENT"], [1766, 1778, "INGREDIENT"], [1784, 1787, "INGREDIENT"], [1806, 1811, "INGREDIENT"], [1823, 1828, "INGREDIENT"], [1829, 1834, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
