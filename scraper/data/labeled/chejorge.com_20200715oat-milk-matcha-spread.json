["Ingredients:\n1 cup unsweetened oat milk\n2 teaspoon high quality matcha powder\n1/8 cup boiling water\nsugar or maple syrup, to taste\n\nInstructions:\nMake the Matcha. In a heat-safe bowl, pour boiling water over matcha powder and quickly whisk until completely dissolved.\nHeat up the oat milk (or other milk of choice) in a sauce pan. Bring to a boil and while whisking, gradually drizzle in the matcha tea. Once all the matcha is added, lower the heat slightly to a light boil (it should still be bubbling!) and reduce uncovered for 15-20 minutes, or until reduced by 1/3 to 1/2.\nOnce the mixture has thickened enough (NOTE: it will thicken a little bit more once cooled), sweeten to taste (I usually add sugar or maple syrup). Remove from the heat and let cool completely. Store it in a jar or other air-tight container. Consume within a week.\nServe on toast with slivered or chopped almonds.
