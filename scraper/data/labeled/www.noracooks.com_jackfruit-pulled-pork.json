["Ingredients:\n(2) 20-ounce cans young green jackfruit, in water or brine\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n1 small sweet onion, diced\n1 cup BBQ Sauce (store bought or homemade )\n1/2 cup water\nSriracha hot sauce, to taste\nsalt, to taste\n4-6  vegan buns\n1 Recipe Vegan Coleslaw\n\nInstructions:\nDrain and rinse the jackfruit from the can. Rinse very well if your jackfruit was packed in brine. Chop off the hard center core portions, if desired(see photos in post above). I like the texture better with the tougher parts removed. Set aside.\nHeat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat, then add the onion and cook for 3-4 minutes until translucent.\nAdd the jackfruit, BBQ sauce and 1/2 cup of water. Stir well to combine, then cover and simmer for 20 minutes on low-medium heat, stirring occasionally.\nAfter 20 minutes, remove the lid and mash the jackfruit with a potato masher or two forks, to create a shredded texture so it resembled pulled pork. Add Sriracha hot sauce and salt to taste.\nTo finish, turn the heat up to high and cook for another 10 minutes, stirring frequently. This helps it dry up a bit and get blackened in some spots, which makes it extra tasty!\nRemove from heat and serve on buns with Vegan Coleslaw.
