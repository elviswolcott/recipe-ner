["Ingredients:\n1 cup raw cashews\n4 tablespoons lemon juice\n1/4 cup refined coconut oil ((make sure it is refined for no coconut flavor))\n1/2 cup nutritional yeast\n1 tablespoon cornstarch\n2 teaspoons paprika, smoked for smoky flavored cheese\n1/4 teaspoon turmeric\n1 1/2 teaspoons salt\n2 cups water, divided\n1 tablespoon agar agar powder\n\nInstructions:\nBring 3 cups of water to a boil. Pour the hot water over the cashews and let soak for 5 minutes. Prepare 2 small ramekins or 1 larger dish by lightly spraying with oil.\nDrain the cashews and discard the soaking water. Add them to a blender along with the lemon juice, refined coconut oil, nutritional yeast, cornstarch, paprika, turmeric, salt and 1 cup of fresh water (not the full 2 cups). Blend well, scraping down the sides of the blender as needed, until completely smooth.\nIn a small-medium pot, add the remaining cup of water and the agar agar powder. Stir until it dissolves (this only take a minute). Now add the cashew mixture from the blender to the pot.\nTurn the heat on to high, bring to a boil and stir for 1-2 minutes, whisking constantly. It will thicken somewhat in the pot. *See the photos in the post above for reference.\nImmediately pour the cheese into the prepared ramekins and smooth out the top with a spoon.\nRefrigerate for 2-3 hours until firm, then turn upside down on a plate to remove the cheese from the container. Slice and serve in sandwiches, make a grilled cheese sandwich, spread on crackers and eat as a snack.\nStoring: I like to wrap it in paper towels and then plastic wrap to keep it dry and firm. It will keep in the refrigerator for 5-6 days. I haven&#039;t tried freezing it but I think it will work okay.", {"entities": [[13, 18, "QUANTITY"], [19, 30, "INGREDIENT"], [31, 44, "QUANTITY"], [45, 56, "INGREDIENT"], [57, 64, "QUANTITY"], [65, 84, "INGREDIENT"], [118, 125, "INGREDIENT"], [135, 142, "QUANTITY"], [143, 160, "INGREDIENT"], [161, 173, "QUANTITY"], [174, 184, "INGREDIENT"], [185, 196, "QUANTITY"], [197, 238, "INGREDIENT"], [239, 251, "QUANTITY"], [252, 260, "INGREDIENT"], [261, 276, "QUANTITY"], [277, 281, "INGREDIENT"], [282, 288, "QUANTITY"], [289, 303, "INGREDIENT"], [304, 316, "QUANTITY"], [317, 333, "INGREDIENT"], [355, 361, "QUANTITY"], [362, 370, "INGREDIENT"], [376, 380, "PROCESS"], [391, 400, "INGREDIENT"], [410, 417, "INGREDIENT"], [513, 516, "INGREDIENT"], [528, 535, "INGREDIENT"], [560, 565, "INGREDIENT"], [604, 615, "INGREDIENT"], [617, 636, "INGREDIENT"], [638, 655, "INGREDIENT"], [657, 667, "INGREDIENT"], [669, 676, "INGREDIENT"], [678, 686, "INGREDIENT"], [688, 692, "INGREDIENT"], [697, 702, "QUANTITY"], [706, 711, "INGREDIENT"], [712, 717, "INGREDIENT"], [732, 738, "QUANTITY"], [851, 854, "PROCESS"], [869, 872, "QUANTITY"], [873, 881, "INGREDIENT"], [890, 906, "INGREDIENT"], [963, 966, "PROCESS"], [1052, 1056, "PROCESS"], [1061, 1065, "PROCESS"], [1432, 1439, "PROCESS"], [1515, 1519, "PROCESS"], [1556, 1560, "PROCESS"]]}]
