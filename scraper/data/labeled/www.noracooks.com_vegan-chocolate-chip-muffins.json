["Ingredients:\n1 cup unsweetened soy milk\n1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar\n2 cups all purpose flour\n1 cup granulated sugar\n2 teaspoons baking powder\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1 tablespoon cornstarch\n1/2 cup melted vegan butter\n1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract\n1 1/2 cups vegan chocolate chips\n1-2 tablespoons coarse sugar, optional\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Spray a standard muffin pan with non-stick spray or use paper liners and spray them with a little oil.\u00c2\u00a0\nCombine the soy milk and apple cider vinegar in a glass measuring cup and set aside to curdle. This is your &quot;buttermilk&quot;.\nIn a large mixing bowl, whisk together all the dry ingredients: flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and cornstarch.\u00c2\u00a0\nPour in the soy milk/vinegar mixture, melted vegan butter and vanilla. Stir with a large spoon to combine, but do not over mix. Some small lumps are fine.\nFold in the chocolate chips, gently. Using a small measuring cup or ice cream scoop, add batter to the liners and fill all the way to the top. Top with a sprinkle of coarse sugar, if desired.\nBake for 22-26 minutes, until lightly golden brown on top and a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Do not over bake, or they will be dry and hard. Let cool 5 minutes in the pan, then move to a cooling rack. Eat and enjoy!\nStore leftover muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for about 3 days. You can also freeze them by wrapping them in plastic wrap and placing them in a large freezer bag.", {"entities": [[13, 18, "QUANTITY"], [19, 39, "INGREDIENT"], [40, 50, "QUANTITY"], [51, 70, "INGREDIENT"], [71, 77, "QUANTITY"], [78, 95, "INGREDIENT"], [96, 101, "QUANTITY"], [102, 118, "INGREDIENT"], [119, 130, "QUANTITY"], [131, 144, "INGREDIENT"], [145, 157, "QUANTITY"], [158, 162, "INGREDIENT"], [163, 175, "QUANTITY"], [176, 186, "INGREDIENT"], [187, 194, "QUANTITY"], [195, 214, "INGREDIENT"], [215, 227, "QUANTITY"], [228, 248, "INGREDIENT"], [249, 259, "QUANTITY"], [260, 281, "INGREDIENT"], [284, 297, "QUANTITY"], [298, 320, "INGREDIENT"], [469, 472, "INGREDIENT"], [488, 496, "INGREDIENT"], [501, 520, "INGREDIENT"], [542, 545, "QUANTITY"], [619, 625, "PROCESS"], [632, 637, "PROCESS"], [672, 677, "INGREDIENT"], [679, 684, "INGREDIENT"], [686, 699, "INGREDIENT"], [701, 705, "INGREDIENT"], [710, 720, "INGREDIENT"], [736, 744, "INGREDIENT"], [745, 752, "INGREDIENT"], [762, 781, "INGREDIENT"], [786, 793, "INGREDIENT"], [847, 850, "PROCESS"], [891, 906, "INGREDIENT"], [940, 943, "QUANTITY"], [947, 950, "INGREDIENT"], [964, 967, "PROCESS"], [1033, 1041, "PROCESS"], [1052, 1057, "INGREDIENT"], [1183, 1187, "PROCESS"], [1384, 1387, "INGREDIENT"], [1433, 1437, "PROCESS"]]}]
