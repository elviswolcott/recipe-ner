["Ingredients:\n1/2 cup vegan butter\n2 cups graham cracker crumbs (honey free)*\n1 cup vegan chocolate chips\n1 cup mini vegan marshmallows\n1 cup chopped pecans\n1 cup sweetened shredded coconut\n1 cup Vegan Condensed Milk\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9x13 inch baking pan with non-stick spray and line with parchment paper (trust me, things can get sticky and hard to clean).\nIn a microwave safe bowl, melt the vegan butter. Once melted, stir in the graham cracker crumbs until combined. Press evenly into the bottom of the prepared pan.\nSprinkle the chocolate chips, marshmallows, pecans and shredded coconut evenly over the crust.\nPour the sweetened condensed milk on top and use a spatula to make sure it&#39;s evenly distributed.\nBake for 30-35 minutes, until the edges start to turn golden brown. Remove from the oven.\nCool completely in the pan before lifting the bars out using the parchment paper. You can stick the pan in the refrigerator to speed the cooling process, if desired.\nCut in 24 small squares using a very sharp, large knife. The bars will still be very gooey and messy, so serve on a plate with a fork! Store leftover bars in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 33, "INGREDIENT"], [34, 40, "QUANTITY"], [41, 62, "INGREDIENT"], [64, 69, "INGREDIENT"], [77, 82, "QUANTITY"], [83, 104, "INGREDIENT"], [105, 110, "QUANTITY"], [111, 134, "INGREDIENT"], [135, 140, "QUANTITY"], [141, 155, "INGREDIENT"], [156, 161, "QUANTITY"], [162, 188, "INGREDIENT"], [189, 194, "QUANTITY"], [195, 215, "INGREDIENT"], [284, 290, "PROCESS"], [364, 367, "INGREDIENT"], [434, 446, "INGREDIENT"], [461, 465, "PROCESS"], [473, 494, "INGREDIENT"], [574, 589, "INGREDIENT"], [605, 611, "INGREDIENT"], [616, 632, "INGREDIENT"], [685, 689, "INGREDIENT"], [933, 936, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
