["Ingredients:\n1/2 cup maple syrup (add 1 tbsp sugar for sweeter)\n1/3 cup lemon juice (1 tbsp more if using whole grain flours)\n1/4 cup oil\n1/4 cup water  or non dairy milk\n1/4 tsp vanilla extract, optional\n1 1/2 cup flour (I use all purpose or a combination of all purpose and whole wheat pastry/white whole wheat flour, 1 :1 or 2:1 ratio)\n1 tbsp starch ((cornstarch or arrowroot starch))\n1.5 tbsp poppy seeds\n1.5 tsp baking powder\n1/4 tsp baking soda\n1/3 tsp salt\n1/8 tsp turmeric for color (optional)\nzest of 1/2 to 1 lemon depending on the size of the lemon and your preference of lemonyness\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 C). Mix the wet ingredients in a bowl until well combined.\nAdd the 1 1/4 cup flour and the rest of the dry ingredients and whisk well to make a smooth batter. Add rest of the flour 1 tbsp at a time to make a smooth flowy batter, but not overly watery or overly stiff. You might not need all of the flour if using whole grain flour.\nPour the batter into a greased donut pan. Even it out using a spatula.\nBake for 20 to 22 minutes. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes then remove the donuts. (bake for 12 mins for mini muffins, 22 mins for regular size muffins).\nYou can use the cream cheese frosting from my lemon cake on these donuts or use a simple sugar icing (half cup of powdered sugar with a tsp or so lemon juice, whisk until icing consistency)\nDip the donuts in the prepared icing or frosting. Sprinkle more poppy seeds on the top.&nbsp;", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 32, "INGREDIENT"], [34, 37, "PROCESS"], [38, 44, "QUANTITY"], [45, 62, "INGREDIENT"], [64, 71, "QUANTITY"], [72, 83, "INGREDIENT"], [85, 91, "QUANTITY"], [126, 133, "QUANTITY"], [134, 137, "INGREDIENT"], [138, 145, "QUANTITY"], [146, 170, "INGREDIENT"], [171, 178, "QUANTITY"], [179, 204, "INGREDIENT"], [205, 214, "QUANTITY"], [215, 220, "INGREDIENT"], [276, 287, "INGREDIENT"], [295, 318, "INGREDIENT"], [339, 345, "QUANTITY"], [346, 352, "INGREDIENT"], [355, 385, "INGREDIENT"], [397, 408, "INGREDIENT"], [417, 430, "INGREDIENT"], [431, 438, "QUANTITY"], [439, 450, "INGREDIENT"], [451, 463, "INGREDIENT"], [464, 471, "QUANTITY"], [472, 490, "INGREDIENT"], [715, 724, "QUANTITY"], [725, 730, "INGREDIENT"], [771, 776, "PROCESS"], [823, 828, "INGREDIENT"], [829, 835, "QUANTITY"], [946, 951, "INGREDIENT"], [973, 978, "INGREDIENT"], [1133, 1137, "PROCESS"], [1207, 1210, "INGREDIENT"], [1219, 1231, "INGREDIENT"], [1292, 1297, "INGREDIENT"], [1310, 1313, "QUANTITY"], [1314, 1331, "INGREDIENT"], [1343, 1348, "INGREDIENT"], [1349, 1360, "INGREDIENT"], [1362, 1367, "PROCESS"], [1457, 1468, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
