Deglaze with red wine and vegetable broth. Add the herbs and season with salt and pepper. Press the \"Slow Cook\" function and choose 5 hours.\nIf you use a regular slow cooker, do the same on the stove top. Then transfer everything to the slow cooker or just use the slow cooker pot to cook everything on the stove top. In this case, add the corn starch (whisk well with 2 tablespoons of water before adding) together with the herbs. (If you use an Instant Pot you will add it later). Cook for 5 hours. Serve with fettuccine.\nIf you use an Instant Pot, press the \"Saut\u00c3\u00a9\" function once the 5 hours are over. Stir in the corn starch (whisk well with 2 tablespoons of water before adding) and cook for about 3 minutes until the sauce becomes thicker. Serve with fettuccine.\n**You could also make this recipe by using the Instant Pot manual function. Cook it on high pressure for 8 minutes.
