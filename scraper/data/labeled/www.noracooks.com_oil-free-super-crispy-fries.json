["Ingredients:\n4-5 pounds russet potatoes (peeled and cut about 2-3 inches long)\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n2 teaspoons salt (divided)\n1 teaspoon garlic powder\n1 teaspoon onion powder\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees and prepare a large roasting pan either with parchment paper or a silicone mat. If your pans are smaller you will need two.\nAdd the peeled and cut potatoes to a large pot. Cover with water and then add the baking soda and 1 teaspoon salt. Stir and bring to a boil.\nSimmer for about 10 minutes, just until a little resistance is met when you insert a fork into the potato chunk. You don't want them super soft and overcooked at this point.\nDrain the potatoes, and add to a large bowl with a lid, preferably.\nTo the large bowl with the potatoes, add the remaining 1 teaspoon salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and either stir very well, or put the lid on and carefully shake the bowl until all ingredients are well combined. There will be a thick paste on the potatoes at this point; that is what you want.\nTransfer the potatoes to the roasting pan(s), spreading them out evenly.\nRoast for 30 minutes, then turn the potatoes and roast for about 30 minutes more.\nRemove from oven and serve.", {"entities": [[24, 39, "INGREDIENT"], [79, 91, "QUANTITY"], [92, 103, "INGREDIENT"], [104, 115, "QUANTITY"], [116, 120, "INGREDIENT"], [131, 141, "QUANTITY"], [142, 155, "INGREDIENT"], [156, 166, "QUANTITY"], [167, 179, "INGREDIENT"], [247, 255, "PROCESS"], [374, 382, "INGREDIENT"], [410, 415, "INGREDIENT"], [425, 428, "PROCESS"], [433, 444, "INGREDIENT"], [449, 459, "QUANTITY"], [460, 465, "INGREDIENT"], [486, 490, "PROCESS"], [591, 597, "INGREDIENT"], [676, 684, "INGREDIENT"], [690, 693, "PROCESS"], [761, 769, "INGREDIENT"], [771, 774, "PROCESS"], [789, 799, "QUANTITY"], [800, 804, "INGREDIENT"], [806, 819, "INGREDIENT"], [821, 833, "INGREDIENT"], [846, 850, "PROCESS"], [972, 977, "INGREDIENT"], [985, 993, "INGREDIENT"], [1045, 1053, "INGREDIENT"], [1061, 1069, "PROCESS"], [1141, 1149, "INGREDIENT"], [1154, 1159, "PROCESS"]]}]
