["Ingredients:\n2 cups all-purpose flour\n1 cup shredded zucchini\n1  small banana, mashed\n1/4 cup maple syrup\n1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce\n1/4 cup canola oil or melted coconut oil\n1 teaspoon natural vanilla extract\n2 teaspoons baking powder\n1/4 cup coconut sugar or brown sugar\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon\n1/4 teaspoon nutmeg\n1/3 cup walnuts, chopped\n1/3 cup dark chocolate chips (make sure they're vegan)\n\nInstructions:\nGrate the zucchini either in a food processor or with a handheld grater. Then&nbsp;throughly squeeze them with your hands to remove as much excess water as possible.&nbsp;\nCombine the dry ingredients in a bowl. Preheat your oven to 350 F.&nbsp;\nThen add the mashed banana, the apple sauce, the maple syrup, the oil, and the vanilla extract. Stir until combined. Then add the grated zucchini and stir quickly.\nNext, mix in the chopped walnuts and the dark chocolate chips. Make sure not to overmix the batter as this can cause the zucchini bread to not rise properly\nLine a loaf pan with parchment paper (let the parchment paper overlap the loaf pan) and pour the vegan zucchini bread batter into the loaf pan.&nbsp;\nBake your zucchini bread for 40-50 minutes. Do&nbsp;a toothpick test to check if the zucchini bread is done. Just stick a toothpick into the center of your zucchini bread. If there is wet batter on the toothpick, it needs more time. But if it comes out clean, it's done.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;Let the zucchini bread cool down in the loaf pan for about 20 minutes before moving it to a cooling rack. If you take it out too early, it might break apart.&nbsp;", {"entities": [[13, 19, "QUANTITY"], [20, 37, "INGREDIENT"], [38, 43, "QUANTITY"], [44, 61, "INGREDIENT"], [79, 85, "INGREDIENT"], [86, 93, "QUANTITY"], [94, 105, "INGREDIENT"], [106, 113, "QUANTITY"], [114, 137, "INGREDIENT"], [138, 145, "QUANTITY"], [146, 178, "INGREDIENT"], [179, 189, "QUANTITY"], [190, 213, "INGREDIENT"], [214, 225, "QUANTITY"], [226, 239, "INGREDIENT"], [240, 247, "QUANTITY"], [248, 276, "INGREDIENT"], [277, 289, "QUANTITY"], [290, 294, "INGREDIENT"], [295, 310, "QUANTITY"], [311, 319, "INGREDIENT"], [320, 332, "QUANTITY"], [333, 339, "INGREDIENT"], [340, 347, "QUANTITY"], [348, 364, "INGREDIENT"], [365, 372, "QUANTITY"], [373, 393, "INGREDIENT"], [582, 587, "INGREDIENT"], [685, 688, "PROCESS"], [693, 706, "INGREDIENT"], [712, 723, "INGREDIENT"], [729, 740, "INGREDIENT"], [746, 749, "INGREDIENT"], [759, 774, "INGREDIENT"], [802, 805, "PROCESS"], [810, 825, "INGREDIENT"], [830, 834, "PROCESS"], [850, 853, "PROCESS"], [861, 876, "INGREDIENT"], [885, 905, "INGREDIENT"], [951, 954, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
