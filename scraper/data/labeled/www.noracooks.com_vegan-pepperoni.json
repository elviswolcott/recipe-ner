["Ingredients:\n1 1/2 cups vital wheat gluten flour\n1/4 cup nutritional yeast\n1 tablespoon smoked paprika\n2 teaspoons fennel seed\n1 teaspoon salt\n1 teaspoon garlic powder\n1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper\n3/4 cup water\n1/4 cup tomato paste\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n2 tablespoons soy sauce\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 325 degrees F.\nIn a large bowl, mix together all the dry ingredients.&nbsp;\nIn a smaller bowl, whisk all the wet ingredients together until well combined.\nPour the wet into the dry ingredients and mix with a large spoon until it comes together. It will be like a dough that is pretty rough at this point.\nTurn the dough onto a work surface and knead until smooth. Break into 3 sections and shape each section into logs about 2 inches in diameter.&nbsp;\nWrap tightly in aluminum foil, twisting the ends to secure.\nBake for 60 minutes, placing the foil-wrapped logs directly on the oven racks.&nbsp;\nRemove from oven, unwrap and let cool for 5-10 minutes. Slice the pepperoni very thin, or thicker if desired. Store extra pepperoni in an air tight container or plastic wrap.&nbsp;", {"entities": [[13, 23, "QUANTITY"], [24, 48, "INGREDIENT"], [49, 56, "QUANTITY"], [57, 74, "INGREDIENT"], [75, 87, "QUANTITY"], [88, 102, "INGREDIENT"], [103, 114, "QUANTITY"], [115, 126, "INGREDIENT"], [127, 137, "QUANTITY"], [138, 142, "INGREDIENT"], [143, 153, "QUANTITY"], [154, 167, "INGREDIENT"], [168, 180, "QUANTITY"], [181, 195, "INGREDIENT"], [196, 203, "QUANTITY"], [204, 209, "INGREDIENT"], [210, 217, "QUANTITY"], [218, 230, "INGREDIENT"], [231, 244, "QUANTITY"], [245, 254, "INGREDIENT"], [255, 268, "QUANTITY"], [269, 278, "INGREDIENT"], [346, 349, "PROCESS"], [409, 414, "PROCESS"], [511, 514, "PROCESS"], [658, 663, "PROCESS"], [710, 714, "INGREDIENT"], [993, 997, "PROCESS"]]}]
