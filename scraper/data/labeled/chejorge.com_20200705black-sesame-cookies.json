["Ingredients:\n1 small ripe banana, mashed (yields about 1/4 cup)\n1/2 cup black sesame paste\n1 teaspoon baking powder\n1/4 cup sugar\n1/2 cup vegan white chocolate chips\nflakey sea salt, for topping\n1 cup black sesame seeds\n4 tablespoons vegetable oil\n\nInstructions:\nMake the Black Sesame Paste (Skip if using store-bought). First, heat up a non-stick pan or wok on medium-high heat (no oil), and dry-roast the black sesame seeds, around 5 minutes. Add the roasted black sesame seeds to a food processor and blend first into a rough paste, around 1 minute. Then, add the vegetable oil one tablespoon at a time. Adjust the consistency of the black sesame paste accordingly \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the more oil you add, the creamier the black sesame paste becomes. For this recipe I'd go for a creamier black sesame paste, so I added roughly 4 tablespoons of vegetable oil.\nBake the Cookies. Pre-heat the oven to 180 degrees C (350 F). In a bowl, combine the mashed banana, black sesame paste, baking powder, and sugar. Combine well with a whisk. Finish this by stirring in the white chocolate chips. Using a spoon or a scooper, scoop the cookie mixture onto a parchment-lined baking tray, giving plenty of room between each dollop. The mixture may not have much structural integrity but try your best to shape each dollop into round circles. Bake the cookies for around 18-20 minutes, or until the batter has set (but will still be very soft; they will firm up more when cooled). Remove from the oven and let cool on a wire wrack. Finish them with some flakey sea salt and enjoy!", {"entities": [[34, 40, "INGREDIENT"], [55, 62, "QUANTITY"], [64, 71, "QUANTITY"], [72, 90, "INGREDIENT"], [91, 101, "QUANTITY"], [102, 115, "INGREDIENT"], [116, 123, "QUANTITY"], [124, 129, "INGREDIENT"], [130, 137, "QUANTITY"], [138, 165, "INGREDIENT"], [173, 181, "INGREDIENT"], [195, 200, "QUANTITY"], [201, 219, "INGREDIENT"], [220, 233, "QUANTITY"], [234, 247, "INGREDIENT"], [383, 386, "INGREDIENT"], [397, 402, "PROCESS"], [407, 425, "INGREDIENT"], [453, 479, "INGREDIENT"], [529, 534, "INGREDIENT"], [559, 562, "PROCESS"], [567, 580, "INGREDIENT"], [637, 655, "INGREDIENT"], [681, 684, "INGREDIENT"], [689, 692, "PROCESS"], [711, 729, "INGREDIENT"], [777, 795, "INGREDIENT"], [802, 807, "PROCESS"], [816, 829, "QUANTITY"], [833, 846, "INGREDIENT"], [933, 946, "INGREDIENT"], [948, 966, "INGREDIENT"], [968, 981, "INGREDIENT"], [987, 992, "INGREDIENT"], [1014, 1019, "PROCESS"], [1036, 1044, "PROCESS"], [1058, 1073, "INGREDIENT"], [1151, 1157, "PROCESS"], [1194, 1198, "INGREDIENT"], [1285, 1289, "INGREDIENT"], [1535, 1543, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
