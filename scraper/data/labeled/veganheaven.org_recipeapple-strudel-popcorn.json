["Ingredients:\n1/2 cup popcorn kernels\n1/2 cup apple chips, chopped\n4 tablespoons brown sugar\n1 tablespoon agave\n1/3 cup raisins\n1-2 teaspoons cinnamon\n\nInstructions:\nPut enough oil in a medium saucepan so that the bottom is completely covered. Turn the heat on high. Add the sugar and allow to caramelize. Then add the kernels and the cinnamon.\nPlace the lid on top and wait for the kernels to begin to pop. Give the pot a little swirl, so all the kernels are coated by the hot oil.\nWhen the popping slows, turn off the heat. Immediately transfer the popcorn to a large bowl. Stir in the agave and add the apple chips, the raisins, and sprinkle the popcorn with some  more cinnamon. Enjoy!", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 36, "INGREDIENT"], [37, 44, "QUANTITY"], [45, 65, "INGREDIENT"], [66, 79, "QUANTITY"], [80, 91, "INGREDIENT"], [92, 104, "QUANTITY"], [105, 110, "INGREDIENT"], [111, 118, "QUANTITY"], [119, 126, "INGREDIENT"], [129, 140, "QUANTITY"], [141, 149, "INGREDIENT"], [176, 179, "INGREDIENT"], [274, 279, "INGREDIENT"], [310, 313, "PROCESS"], [334, 342, "INGREDIENT"], [477, 480, "INGREDIENT"], [587, 592, "INGREDIENT"], [597, 600, "PROCESS"], [622, 629, "INGREDIENT"], [635, 643, "PROCESS"], [672, 680, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
