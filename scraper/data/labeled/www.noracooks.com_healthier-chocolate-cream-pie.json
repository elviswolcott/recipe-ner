["Ingredients:\n12 ounces silken tofu\n1 1/2 cups dairy free chocolate chips\n2 tablespoons almond milk\n1/2 cup granulated sugar\n1 recipe Easy Vegan Pie Crust (| or use a store bought vegan pie crust)\nCoconut Whip (| homemade or store bought)\nchocolate shavings, optional for top\n\nInstructions:\nPrepare the pie crust: If using my recipe for Easy Vegan Pie Crust, prepare as instructed, transfer to a pie pan, poke holes in the bottom several times with a fork, and bake for 15-20 minutes at 350 degrees F. Remove and let cool while you make the filling.\nMake the chocolate filling: Melt the chocolate chips in a microwave in 30 second intervals, stirring in between, until melted. It took me 1 1/2 minutes. Let it cool for a few minutes. Then add the melted chocolate chips to a blender along with the silken tofu, almond milk and sugar. Blend until very smooth.\nPour the filling on top of the crust. Place in the refrigerator to chill for at least 2 hours. The pie will firm up as it cools.\nOnce the pie has chilled, top with coconut whip cream and chocolate shavings, if desired. You can also serve each slice with a dollop of coconut whip. Serve and enjoy!", {"entities": [[13, 22, "QUANTITY"], [23, 34, "INGREDIENT"], [35, 45, "QUANTITY"], [46, 72, "INGREDIENT"], [73, 86, "QUANTITY"], [87, 98, "INGREDIENT"], [99, 106, "QUANTITY"], [107, 123, "INGREDIENT"], [166, 178, "INGREDIENT"], [224, 236, "INGREDIENT"], [238, 247, "INGREDIENT"], [460, 464, "PROCESS"], [558, 567, "INGREDIENT"], [586, 601, "INGREDIENT"], [641, 649, "PROCESS"], [738, 741, "PROCESS"], [753, 768, "INGREDIENT"], [797, 808, "INGREDIENT"], [810, 821, "INGREDIENT"], [826, 831, "INGREDIENT"], [1022, 1029, "INGREDIENT"], [1045, 1054, "INGREDIENT"], [1081, 1084, "INGREDIENT"], [1096, 1100, "INGREDIENT"], [1124, 1131, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
