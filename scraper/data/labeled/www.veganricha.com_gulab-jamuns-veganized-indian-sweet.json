["Ingredients:\n1.5 cups water\n8-10 Tablespoon raw sugar\n1/8 teaspoon cardamom powder ((add saffron or rose essence if you like))\na generous pinch of saffron strands\n1/3 cup ground almonds\n1/3 cup ground Oats\n2/3 - 3/4 cup self rising flour (or all purpose flour/Whole wheat flour +2/3 tsp baking powder)\n1/4 teaspoon baking powder ((total baking powder, 1/2 to 2/3 teaspoon per cup of dry ingredients))\n1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder\nraisins or raw pistachios to put inside balls ((optional))\n1 Tablespoon tasteless oil ((used organic canola oil))\nFew Tablespoons water or almond milk\nOil for deep frying\n\nInstructions:\nFor the sugar syrup, mix all ingredients in a deep pan( also wide enough to accommodate 10 GJ balls) and bring to a boil. Keep simmering on low till the syrup thickens to a bit thicker than water(3-4 minutes).\nMeanwhile, grind the almonds, and then grind the oats into as fine a powder as possible.\nIn a pan, add the rest of the ingredients for the balls and oil, except water and mix well. Add in a tablespoon of water at a time and make into a soft dough. dont knead too much.\nLet dough sit for 5 minutes, covered.\nMake tiny smooth balls and cover them with damp towel if not immediately frying. Add a raisin or a pistachio in the middle of the ball( that reduces the probability of an uncooked center ;)( cracks in balls are fine, they will not break up on frying!)\nFry at medium hot heat in already hot oil. Keep moving them every 30 seconds till the balls are golden brown. (5-7 minutes). The balls will get atleast 3 shades darker in the syrup, so dont let them cook to a deep brown.\nRemove balls and let sit for half a minute to cool slightly.\nAdd these balls to simmering sugar syrup.\nMix them well to coat for 2 minute and Switch off heat(let syrup be on stove to keep warm). Let sit for atleast half an hour. Stir or turn them 2-3 times in between so all balls get good syrup coverage.", {"entities": [[22, 27, "INGREDIENT"], [30, 43, "QUANTITY"], [44, 53, "INGREDIENT"], [54, 66, "QUANTITY"], [67, 82, "INGREDIENT"], [85, 88, "PROCESS"], [89, 96, "INGREDIENT"], [147, 162, "INGREDIENT"], [163, 170, "QUANTITY"], [171, 185, "INGREDIENT"], [186, 193, "QUANTITY"], [194, 205, "INGREDIENT"], [212, 219, "QUANTITY"], [220, 237, "INGREDIENT"], [242, 259, "INGREDIENT"], [260, 277, "INGREDIENT"], [287, 300, "INGREDIENT"], [302, 314, "QUANTITY"], [315, 328, "INGREDIENT"], [331, 336, "INGREDIENT"], [337, 350, "INGREDIENT"], [359, 371, "QUANTITY"], [376, 379, "QUANTITY"], [401, 413, "QUANTITY"], [414, 429, "INGREDIENT"], [430, 437, "INGREDIENT"], [441, 455, "INGREDIENT"], [489, 501, "QUANTITY"], [502, 515, "INGREDIENT"], [523, 541, "INGREDIENT"], [560, 580, "INGREDIENT"], [581, 584, "INGREDIENT"], [594, 600, "PROCESS"], [624, 635, "INGREDIENT"], [637, 640, "PROCESS"], [732, 736, "PROCESS"], [847, 854, "INGREDIENT"], [875, 879, "INGREDIENT"], [925, 928, "PROCESS"], [975, 978, "INGREDIENT"], [987, 992, "INGREDIENT"], [997, 1000, "PROCESS"], [1027, 1035, "INGREDIENT"], [1079, 1084, "PROCESS"], [1206, 1212, "PROCESS"], [1376, 1382, "PROCESS"], [1423, 1426, "INGREDIENT"], [1584, 1588, "PROCESS"], [1696, 1707, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
