["Ingredients:\n1 cup orange juice or a combination with liquor ((upto half cup of rum, brandy, whiskey or a mix))\n1.25 to 1.5 cups dried fruits and nuts\n1 tbsp chia seeds ((not optional as they help thicken the leftover orange juice. You an use 1.5 tbsp flax seed meal as a sub))\n1/4 to 1/3 cup light brown sugar\n2 tbsp oil ((I use organic safflower))\n1/2 tsp vanilla extract\n1/2 cup white rice flour\n3/4 cup almond flour\n1/4 cup potato starch\n1.5 tsp baking powder\n1/2 tsp citric acid (, optional **)\n1/4 tsp salt\n1 tsp pumpkin pie spice\n\nInstructions:\nAdd juice, dried fruit, nuts, seeds, and chia seeds to a bowl and mix. Let sit refrigerated for a few hours to overnight.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 C). Line a loaf pan with parchment or grease it.&nbsp;\nTake the juice bowl out from the fridge. Add sugar, oil and vanilla to the bowl and mix in until sugar is combined. In another bowl, add the dry ingredients and whisk. (You can omit the citric acid from the dry. I like the air it adds to gluten-free baked goods. See my glutenfree cinnamon roll bread post for details about the use of citric acid)&nbsp;\nCombine the dry and wet and mix to make a batter. Drop in parchment lined pan.\nBake at 350 degrees F for 45 minutes. Check with a toothpick from the center of the cake. it should come out almost clean. Bake longer if needed.&nbsp;\nCool for 10 minutes, then remove from the pan. Cool completely before slicing (cool lightly covered by a towel). Store on the counter covered for upto 2 days, refrigerate for upto 10, freeze for upto 2 months. If using liquor, you can store the cake on the counter and refrigerator for longer.&nbsp;", {"entities": [[13, 18, "QUANTITY"], [19, 60, "INGREDIENT"], [73, 76, "QUANTITY"], [80, 83, "INGREDIENT"], [106, 109, "PROCESS"], [129, 150, "INGREDIENT"], [151, 157, "QUANTITY"], [158, 168, "INGREDIENT"], [218, 230, "INGREDIENT"], [252, 266, "INGREDIENT"], [285, 292, "QUANTITY"], [293, 310, "INGREDIENT"], [311, 317, "QUANTITY"], [318, 321, "INGREDIENT"], [338, 347, "INGREDIENT"], [350, 357, "QUANTITY"], [358, 373, "INGREDIENT"], [374, 381, "QUANTITY"], [382, 398, "INGREDIENT"], [399, 406, "QUANTITY"], [407, 419, "INGREDIENT"], [420, 427, "QUANTITY"], [428, 441, "INGREDIENT"], [450, 463, "INGREDIENT"], [464, 471, "QUANTITY"], [472, 483, "INGREDIENT"], [500, 507, "QUANTITY"], [508, 512, "INGREDIENT"], [513, 518, "QUANTITY"], [519, 536, "INGREDIENT"], [576, 580, "INGREDIENT"], [582, 587, "INGREDIENT"], [593, 603, "INGREDIENT"], [618, 621, "PROCESS"], [813, 818, "INGREDIENT"], [820, 823, "INGREDIENT"], [828, 835, "INGREDIENT"], [852, 855, "PROCESS"], [865, 870, "INGREDIENT"], [901, 904, "PROCESS"], [929, 934, "PROCESS"], [941, 944, "INGREDIENT"], [954, 965, "INGREDIENT"], [1018, 1023, "PROCESS"], [1049, 1057, "INGREDIENT"], [1150, 1153, "PROCESS"], [1584, 1587, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
