["Ingredients:\n2 cups all-purpose flour\n1/2 cup unsweetened almond or soy milk (at room temperature)\n1 teaspoon active dry yeast\n2 tablespoons brown sugar\n2 tablespoons vegan butter\n1 teaspoon natural vanilla extract\n1/2 teaspoon salt\ncanola oil for frying\n3 tablespoons vegan butter\n3 tablespoons granulated sugar\n1 tablespoon ground cinnamon\n\nInstructions:\nMelt the vegan butter in a small pot on the stovetop.It shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t boil. Set aside and let it cool down for 5 minutes.\nIn alarge bowl, combine the flour, the active dry yeast, the sugar, and the salt.\nAdd the melted vegan butter, the vanilla extract, andthe almond milk. Knead with your hands until a smooth dough forms.Alternatively, you could also use a kitchen machine like a KitchenAid.\nLightly oil the bowl and place the dough back intothe bowl. Cover with a clean dish towel and let it rise in a warm spot for 1hour. It should about double in size during this time.\nThen, lightly flour your working surface and place thedough on top. Roll out the dough with a rolling pin. It should be about  inchthick.\nUse a donut cutter to cut out 7 or 8 donuts dependingon the size of your donut cutter.\nLine abaking tray with parchment paper and place the donuts on top. Again, cover itwith a dish towel and let it rise in a warm spot for another hour.\nUse alarge pot or pan and heat about 2 inches of oil over medium heat. The oilshould be about 350 F hot. Either use a frying thermometer or fry a smallpiece of bread in the oil to see if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hot enough. If it becomes brown andcrispy and floats to the top in about 45 seconds, the oil is hot enough for youto start frying the donuts.\nUsing a spatula, carefully add a few donuts to yourpot or pan. Be careful not to splash the hot oil.\nFry them for about 2 minutes on each side untilpuffy and golden brown. Carefully flip them after 2 minutes with the spatula.Use tongs to remove the donuts from the oil when they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re done.\nPlace them on a cooling rack covered with paper towelsto soak up any excess oil.\nMelt the vegan butter for the sugar coating in a smallpot on the stove top. Place it in a shallow dish. Combine the sugar and thecinnamon in another shallow dish.\nDip each donut first in butter and then in the cinnamon sugar mixture. Place it back onthe rack to cool (remove the paper towels before placing the donuts back ontothe cooling rack).", {"entities": [[13, 19, "QUANTITY"], [20, 37, "INGREDIENT"], [38, 45, "QUANTITY"], [46, 76, "INGREDIENT"], [99, 109, "QUANTITY"], [110, 126, "INGREDIENT"], [127, 140, "QUANTITY"], [141, 152, "INGREDIENT"], [153, 166, "QUANTITY"], [167, 179, "INGREDIENT"], [180, 190, "QUANTITY"], [191, 214, "INGREDIENT"], [215, 227, "QUANTITY"], [228, 232, "INGREDIENT"], [233, 243, "INGREDIENT"], [248, 254, "PROCESS"], [255, 268, "QUANTITY"], [269, 281, "INGREDIENT"], [282, 295, "QUANTITY"], [296, 312, "INGREDIENT"], [313, 325, "QUANTITY"], [326, 341, "INGREDIENT"], [366, 378, "INGREDIENT"], [425, 429, "PROCESS"], [505, 510, "INGREDIENT"], [516, 532, "INGREDIENT"], [538, 543, "INGREDIENT"], [553, 558, "INGREDIENT"], [567, 586, "INGREDIENT"], [592, 607, "INGREDIENT"], [616, 627, "INGREDIENT"], [757, 760, "INGREDIENT"], [774, 779, "PROCESS"], [944, 949, "INGREDIENT"], [975, 980, "PROCESS"], [1198, 1203, "PROCESS"], [1351, 1357, "INGREDIENT"], [1423, 1429, "PROCESS"], [1445, 1448, "PROCESS"], [1478, 1481, "INGREDIENT"], [1588, 1591, "INGREDIENT"], [1622, 1628, "PROCESS"], [1668, 1671, "PROCESS"], [1737, 1740, "INGREDIENT"], [1774, 1778, "INGREDIENT"], [1906, 1909, "INGREDIENT"], [2007, 2010, "INGREDIENT"], [2021, 2033, "INGREDIENT"], [2042, 2047, "INGREDIENT"], [2128, 2133, "INGREDIENT"], [2179, 2183, "INGREDIENT"], [2199, 2205, "INGREDIENT"], [2222, 2230, "INGREDIENT"], [2231, 2236, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
