["Ingredients:\n2 tablespoons ground flax\n5 tablespoons water\n1 1/2 cup black beans (1-15 oz can), drained and rinsed\n3 tablespoons full fat coconut milk (shake the can before opening, use the creamy stuff)\n3/4 cup regular unsweetened cocoa powder\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n1/4 teaspoon pure peppermint extract\n1/2 cup granulated sugar\n3/4 teaspoon baking powder\n1/2 cup non-dairy chocolate chips (mini or regular)\n1/2 cup crushed peppermint candy canes\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees.\nIn a small bowl, mix together the ground flax and water. Set aside to thicken.\nLightly grease a mini-muffin pan (or regular sized muffin pan). I sprayed very lightly with oil.&nbsp;\nAdd the drained and rinsed black beans and the rest of the ingredients (except for the chocolate chips and crushed candy canes). Puree for a couple of minutes, scraping the sides as necessary to get it all smooth.\nNow add the chocolate chips and stir them in by hand.\nEvenly distribute the mixture into muffin pan. Fill about 3/4 of the way full for a mini-muffin pan, or about 1/2 full if you are using a regular muffin pan.\nBake for 20-25 minutes, until the tops look dry.&nbsp;\nLet cool for about 30 minutes before removing them from the pan. Then sprinkle with crushed candy cane pieces. They will be very soft and fudgy.\nStore in an airtight container for a couple of days, or they will keep for up to a week in the fridge.", {"entities": [[13, 26, "QUANTITY"], [27, 38, "INGREDIENT"], [39, 52, "QUANTITY"], [53, 58, "INGREDIENT"], [59, 68, "QUANTITY"], [69, 80, "INGREDIENT"], [84, 89, "QUANTITY"], [90, 93, "INGREDIENT"], [115, 128, "QUANTITY"], [129, 150, "INGREDIENT"], [162, 165, "INGREDIENT"], [204, 211, "QUANTITY"], [212, 244, "INGREDIENT"], [245, 255, "QUANTITY"], [256, 271, "INGREDIENT"], [272, 284, "QUANTITY"], [285, 308, "INGREDIENT"], [309, 316, "QUANTITY"], [317, 333, "INGREDIENT"], [334, 346, "QUANTITY"], [347, 360, "INGREDIENT"], [361, 368, "QUANTITY"], [369, 394, "INGREDIENT"], [413, 420, "QUANTITY"], [421, 451, "INGREDIENT"], [513, 516, "PROCESS"], [530, 541, "INGREDIENT"], [546, 551, "INGREDIENT"], [705, 716, "INGREDIENT"], [765, 780, "INGREDIENT"], [785, 804, "INGREDIENT"], [896, 899, "PROCESS"], [904, 919, "INGREDIENT"], [924, 928, "PROCESS"], [1229, 1237, "PROCESS"]]}]
