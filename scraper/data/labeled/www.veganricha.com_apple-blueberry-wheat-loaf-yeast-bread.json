["Ingredients:\n2 cups whole wheat flour\n1.5 cups bread flour\n1 teaspoon vital wheat gluten\n1/4 cup flax seed meal\n3 tablespoons raw sugar\n1.5 teaspoons active yeast\n2/3 cup water\n1/2  medium apple\n1/2 cup blueberries\n1/4 teaspoon cinnamon powder\n1/8 teaspoon nutmeg powder\n1 tablespoon vegan butter\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n\nInstructions:\nAdd the yeast and sugar to 1/4 (60ml) cup warm water and mix well. Let stand for 10 minutes or until frothy.\nIn a blender, puree the apple and blueberries with a little warm water.\nAdd in the flax meal, spices and blend and keep aside.\nIn the mixer bowl add the flours, wheat gluten and salt and mix.\nAdd in the yeast mixture, softened butter, fruit puree and 1/4 cup (60ml) water.\nKnead the dough for 8-10 minutes, scraping sides every 2-3 minutes. add more flour or water in little quantities if needed. As with any fruit bread, the fruit gives out a little extra moisture than a normal bread while the dough sits for the rising time. The dough should be soft and non sticky.\nSpritz the top of dough with some oil spray. Place dough in a covered container in a warm place for 1.5 hours.\nPunch it lightly and shape into a loaf by pulling on all sides, or by rolling it out into a rectangle and rolling the rectangle from one side and tucking the other edge under.\nPlace loaf in greased bread pan. Spritz the top with water and then spritz a little oil spray and cover with damp towel.\nPlace it in a warm place or warm oven for about an hour.\nRemove towel, spritz top with some water and bake at 375 degrees F for 40 minutes.\nRemove bread from pan and let cool for an hour.\nI usually refrigerate it for another hour before slicing. The breads are usually quite fluffy and soft and refrigeration makes them a bit firm for nice and clean slices!", {"entities": [[13, 19, "QUANTITY"], [20, 37, "INGREDIENT"], [42, 58, "INGREDIENT"], [59, 69, "QUANTITY"], [70, 88, "INGREDIENT"], [89, 96, "QUANTITY"], [97, 111, "INGREDIENT"], [112, 125, "QUANTITY"], [126, 135, "INGREDIENT"], [150, 162, "INGREDIENT"], [163, 170, "QUANTITY"], [171, 176, "INGREDIENT"], [195, 202, "QUANTITY"], [203, 214, "INGREDIENT"], [215, 227, "QUANTITY"], [228, 243, "INGREDIENT"], [244, 256, "QUANTITY"], [257, 270, "INGREDIENT"], [271, 283, "QUANTITY"], [284, 296, "INGREDIENT"], [297, 309, "QUANTITY"], [310, 314, "INGREDIENT"], [338, 343, "INGREDIENT"], [348, 353, "INGREDIENT"], [368, 382, "INGREDIENT"], [387, 390, "PROCESS"], [453, 458, "INGREDIENT"], [473, 484, "INGREDIENT"], [499, 509, "INGREDIENT"], [522, 531, "INGREDIENT"], [584, 587, "PROCESS"], [600, 612, "INGREDIENT"], [617, 621, "INGREDIENT"], [626, 629, "PROCESS"], [642, 647, "INGREDIENT"], [666, 672, "INGREDIENT"], [680, 685, "INGREDIENT"], [690, 697, "QUANTITY"], [705, 710, "INGREDIENT"], [780, 783, "PROCESS"], [789, 794, "INGREDIENT"], [798, 803, "INGREDIENT"], [1042, 1045, "INGREDIENT"], [1098, 1103, "PROCESS"], [1348, 1353, "INGREDIENT"], [1379, 1382, "INGREDIENT"], [1435, 1440, "PROCESS"], [1508, 1513, "INGREDIENT"], [1518, 1522, "PROCESS"]]}]
