["Ingredients:\n1 1/2 cups all purpose flour (*see notes for options)\n1 tablespoon baking powder\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n2 tablespoons granulated sugar\n1 cup soy milk (*or use almond, oat or coconut milk)\n1/2 cup water\n2 tablespoons canola oil (*may omit for oil free)\n\nInstructions:\nIn a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar.&nbsp;\nPour the milk, water and oil into the bowl with the dry ingredients, and stir with a large spoon until just combined. A few lumps are okay; do not over mix or your pancakes won't be as fluffy.\nHeat a large griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Grease the pan with vegan butter or coconut oil, and drop about 1/3 cup of the batter onto it. Cook until bubbles form, then flip and cook until golden brown on the other side, about 1-2 minutes. Repeat with all the remaining batter.\nServe with vegan butter, pure maple syrup and perhaps some fresh fruit.", {"entities": [[13, 23, "QUANTITY"], [24, 41, "INGREDIENT"], [67, 79, "QUANTITY"], [80, 93, "INGREDIENT"], [94, 106, "QUANTITY"], [107, 111, "INGREDIENT"], [112, 125, "QUANTITY"], [126, 142, "INGREDIENT"], [143, 148, "QUANTITY"], [149, 157, "INGREDIENT"], [182, 194, "INGREDIENT"], [196, 203, "QUANTITY"], [204, 209, "INGREDIENT"], [210, 223, "QUANTITY"], [224, 234, "INGREDIENT"], [250, 253, "INGREDIENT"], [292, 297, "PROCESS"], [311, 316, "INGREDIENT"], [318, 331, "INGREDIENT"], [333, 337, "INGREDIENT"], [364, 368, "INGREDIENT"], [370, 375, "INGREDIENT"], [380, 383, "INGREDIENT"], [428, 432, "PROCESS"], [507, 510, "PROCESS"], [619, 646, "INGREDIENT"], [663, 670, "QUANTITY"], [733, 737, "PROCESS"], [844, 856, "INGREDIENT"], [858, 874, "INGREDIENT"], [892, 897, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
