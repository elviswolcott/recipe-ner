["Ingredients:\n2 cups + 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour\n1/2 cup plant-based margarine (It should be soft, so put it out of the fridge about 1 hour before using.)\n1/4 cup agave\n1 1/2 tablespoons baking powder\n2 tablespoons water\n35 oz vanilla soy yogurt ((1 kg) )\n2 bags vanilla pudding powder or custard powder (make sure it's vegan) ((2.8 oz or 80 g in total))\n1/2 cup melted margarine\n1/4 cup agave\n1/2 cup  pureed raspberries\nfresh raspberries\nfresh mint leaves\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 350 F. Prepare the crust: Combine all ingredients in a mixing bowl and use your hands to knead it into a soft dough.\nRub the pan with margarine all over the bottom and sides of the pan.\nPress the dough into the bottom and up the sides of the pan, making a thicker layer on the bottom than on the sides.\nIn a large mixing bowl combine all the ingredients for the cheesecake filling. Beat with a hand-held electric mixer until well combined.\nPour in the filling and bake for about 1 hour. Don't worry if the filling is still soft and a bit runny. It will harden once the cake has cooled down. Let it cool down for an hour. Then place it in the fridge for at least 4 hours.\nTop it with the raspberry sauce, some fresh raspberries, and some mint leaves.
