["Ingredients:\n1 tablespoon dijon mustard\n2 teaspoons flaxseed meal\n1 teaspoon flour or use corn starch to make it gluten-free\n2 tablespoons maple syrup\n2 tablespoons non-dairy milk\n1 teaspoon oil\n1 teaspoon garlic powder\n1/2 teaspoon onion powder\n1 teaspoon paprika\n1/2 teaspoon dried cayenne\n1/2 teaspoon of cayenne\n1/2 teaspoon black pepper\n1/4 cup bread crumbs\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n14 ounces of extra firm tofu (pressed for 15 minutes and cubed)\n1  sweet potato (cubed)\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n1/4 tsp thyme for sweet potatoes\noil as needed  for sweet potatoes\n1 cup blueberries\n1 cup thinly sliced apples\nfresh spinach as needed\n1/3 cup of pecans\n1 tablespoon maple syrup\n1 tablespoon lime juice\n1 tablespoon water\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n\nInstructions:\nMake the marinade by mixing all the ingredients in a bowl and set aside. Press and cube the tofu if you haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t already\nAdd your pressed and cubed tofu to the marinade and toss well. Let it sit for 5 minutes. Mix the crispy coating ingredients in a shallow bowl\nThen carefully transfer the marinated tofu to the shallow bowl leaving the excess marinade in the original bowl.\nToss the tofu in the coating to coat all of the tofu. Then transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet.\nIn another bowl, add the sweet potatoes, 1/4 tsp salt, black pepper to taste, thyme, and 1 teaspoon oil and mix well.\nToss well to coat and spread the sweet potato cubes on the same baking sheet.\nBake at 400 degrees F (200 c )  for 25-30 minutes or until the tofu is crisp and the sweet potato is cooked to preference.\nMake the dressing by combining all the ingredients in a small bowl. I also like to add a couple of blueberries to this dressing and smash them just for color and a different flavor\nAssemble your bowl by adding spinach or other greens of choice. Some blueberries, apples, a good helping of the tofu and the sweet potato. Drizzle with the dressing and serve.", {"entities": [[13, 25, "QUANTITY"], [26, 39, "INGREDIENT"], [40, 51, "QUANTITY"], [52, 65, "INGREDIENT"], [66, 76, "QUANTITY"], [77, 124, "INGREDIENT"], [125, 138, "QUANTITY"], [139, 150, "INGREDIENT"], [151, 164, "QUANTITY"], [165, 179, "INGREDIENT"], [180, 190, "QUANTITY"], [191, 194, "INGREDIENT"], [195, 205, "QUANTITY"], [206, 219, "INGREDIENT"], [220, 232, "QUANTITY"], [233, 245, "INGREDIENT"], [246, 256, "QUANTITY"], [257, 264, "INGREDIENT"], [265, 277, "QUANTITY"], [278, 291, "INGREDIENT"], [292, 304, "QUANTITY"], [305, 315, "INGREDIENT"], [316, 328, "QUANTITY"], [329, 341, "INGREDIENT"], [342, 349, "QUANTITY"], [350, 362, "INGREDIENT"], [363, 375, "QUANTITY"], [376, 380, "INGREDIENT"], [381, 390, "QUANTITY"], [391, 409, "INGREDIENT"], [411, 418, "PROCESS"], [438, 443, "INGREDIENT"], [448, 460, "INGREDIENT"], [462, 467, "INGREDIENT"], [469, 481, "QUANTITY"], [482, 486, "INGREDIENT"], [487, 494, "QUANTITY"], [495, 519, "INGREDIENT"], [520, 523, "INGREDIENT"], [545, 553, "INGREDIENT"], [554, 559, "QUANTITY"], [560, 571, "INGREDIENT"], [572, 577, "QUANTITY"], [578, 598, "INGREDIENT"], [599, 612, "INGREDIENT"], [623, 630, "QUANTITY"], [631, 640, "INGREDIENT"], [641, 653, "QUANTITY"], [654, 665, "INGREDIENT"], [666, 678, "QUANTITY"], [679, 689, "INGREDIENT"], [690, 702, "QUANTITY"], [703, 708, "INGREDIENT"], [709, 721, "QUANTITY"], [722, 726, "INGREDIENT"], [727, 739, "QUANTITY"], [740, 752, "INGREDIENT"], [789, 795, "PROCESS"], [860, 864, "INGREDIENT"], [899, 906, "PROCESS"], [911, 921, "INGREDIENT"], [1070, 1074, "INGREDIENT"], [1154, 1158, "INGREDIENT"], [1193, 1197, "INGREDIENT"], [1234, 1240, "PROCESS"], [1265, 1268, "PROCESS"], [1279, 1287, "INGREDIENT"], [1289, 1296, "QUANTITY"], [1297, 1301, "INGREDIENT"], [1303, 1315, "INGREDIENT"], [1326, 1331, "INGREDIENT"], [1337, 1347, "QUANTITY"], [1348, 1351, "INGREDIENT"], [1356, 1359, "PROCESS"], [1399, 1411, "INGREDIENT"], [1430, 1436, "PROCESS"], [1507, 1511, "INGREDIENT"], [1529, 1541, "INGREDIENT"], [1545, 1551, "PROCESS"], [1650, 1653, "PROCESS"], [1666, 1677, "INGREDIENT"], [1770, 1776, "PROCESS"], [1777, 1784, "INGREDIENT"], [1817, 1828, "INGREDIENT"], [1860, 1864, "INGREDIENT"], [1873, 1885, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
