["Ingredients:\n1  can full fat coconut milk\n1 tsp starch like cornstarch  (or arrowroot starch)\n1/2 tsp vanilla extract\n1/4 tsp cinnamon\n1 tbsp maple or agave syrup\n2 to 3 Tbsp coconut sugar  (or sweetener of choice or more maple/agave to taste)\n1 tsp oil\n1 Tbsp oat flour  (or other flour of choice)\n2 tsp granulated sugar\n2 tsp ground/powdered sugar\n1/8 tsp salt\n1 tsp cinnamon\n\nInstructions:\nBlend all the ingredients under ice cream until smooth. Taste and adjust sweet. Pour in popsicle molds and chill in the freezer for 15 minutes. This helps thicken the mixture a bit so that all of the snickerdoodle crumbs do not sink to the bottom or dissolve completely into the base.\nMeanwhile make the snickerdoodle crumble. Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add oat flour and sugar and mix well. Cook over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes or until the sugar starts to crisp up and the flour smells fragrant.\nCool for a minute, then add in the salt and cinnamon and mix in. Press and mix to resemble fat crumbs. Add a spray of oil if the crumbs are too dry or powdery.Cool for another minute or so until room temperature.\nRemove the popsicles from the freezer, distribute the crumbs into the pops. Add the popsicle sticks or holder and freeze until fully frozen.", {"entities": [[16, 41, "INGREDIENT"], [42, 47, "QUANTITY"], [48, 70, "INGREDIENT"], [76, 92, "INGREDIENT"], [94, 101, "QUANTITY"], [102, 117, "INGREDIENT"], [118, 125, "QUANTITY"], [126, 134, "INGREDIENT"], [135, 141, "QUANTITY"], [142, 162, "INGREDIENT"], [168, 174, "QUANTITY"], [175, 188, "INGREDIENT"], [194, 213, "INGREDIENT"], [214, 221, "INGREDIENT"], [222, 227, "INGREDIENT"], [228, 233, "INGREDIENT"], [244, 249, "QUANTITY"], [250, 253, "INGREDIENT"], [254, 260, "QUANTITY"], [261, 270, "INGREDIENT"], [282, 297, "INGREDIENT"], [299, 304, "QUANTITY"], [305, 321, "INGREDIENT"], [322, 327, "QUANTITY"], [328, 349, "INGREDIENT"], [350, 357, "QUANTITY"], [358, 362, "INGREDIENT"], [363, 368, "QUANTITY"], [369, 377, "INGREDIENT"], [425, 428, "INGREDIENT"], [725, 728, "INGREDIENT"], [760, 769, "INGREDIENT"], [774, 779, "INGREDIENT"], [784, 787, "PROCESS"], [848, 853, "INGREDIENT"], [881, 886, "INGREDIENT"], [928, 931, "PROCESS"], [939, 943, "INGREDIENT"], [948, 956, "INGREDIENT"], [961, 964, "PROCESS"], [979, 982, "PROCESS"], [1019, 1025, "INGREDIENT"], [1087, 1092, "INGREDIENT"], [1250, 1256, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
