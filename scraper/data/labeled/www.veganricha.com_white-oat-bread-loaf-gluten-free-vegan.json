["Ingredients:\n6 Tbsp oats (ground (1/4 cup +2Tbsp)(All flours starches are Bob's red mill))\n1/4 cup brown rice flour\n1/4 cup potato starch\n1 Tbsp tapioca starch\n1/4 cup warm water\n1 teaspoon active yeast\n2 tsp raw sugar\n1 tsp agave syrup\n1.5 Tbsp non dairy yogurt (So Delicious plain coconut milk yogurt or make your own cultured Nut Milk -Cashew Yogurt)\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n2 teaspoons oil\n1-1.5 Tablespoon potato starch (or half potato starch and half ground oats)\n\nInstructions:\nWarm the water and add yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar to it. Mix well and let it get frothy. 8-10 minutes.\nIn a bowl, whisk all the dry ingredients well.\nIn another bowl, lightly whisk the oil, yogurt, agave and sugar until well combined.\nAdd the dry ingredients and the yogurt mix to the yeast mix and whisk to combine well. The dough will be more of a stiff batter.\nLet it rise for 1.5 hours or until doubled.\nThe oats will make the dough less battery after the first rise, but it will still be sticky.\nAdd some potato starch to make it less sticky and dump the sticky dough into parchment lined mini bread loaf pan. Even out using a spatula.\nIf you want to make dinner rolls, use just enough potato starch and oats flour and use oiled hands to quickly make small balls(a few Tbspns). Place balls touching each other in parchment lined stoneware for baking or round cake baking pan if steaming. See GF Dinner rolls\nSpray top with water, and then with oil or dust with Oat flour.\nPrepare steaming pan, warm the water, switch off and place the bread pan in the steamer. Cover and let rise until doubled. (20-35 minutes)\nStart up the steamer and steam for 20 minutes or atleast half the total bake time.\nMeanwhile preheat the oven to 395 degrees F. Take the pan out of the steamer after 20 minutes and immediately place in oven.\nBake at 395 for 12-17 minutes to just about brown the edges. Dont over brown it. steamed breads will not brown easily and then directly become too crusty.\nLet bread cool outside the pan for 15 minutes before slicing.", {"entities": [[13, 19, "QUANTITY"], [20, 24, "INGREDIENT"], [26, 32, "INGREDIENT"], [34, 41, "QUANTITY"], [91, 98, "QUANTITY"], [99, 115, "INGREDIENT"], [116, 123, "QUANTITY"], [124, 137, "INGREDIENT"], [138, 144, "QUANTITY"], [145, 159, "INGREDIENT"], [164, 178, "INGREDIENT"], [179, 189, "QUANTITY"], [190, 202, "INGREDIENT"], [203, 208, "QUANTITY"], [209, 218, "INGREDIENT"], [219, 224, "QUANTITY"], [225, 236, "INGREDIENT"], [246, 262, "INGREDIENT"], [264, 302, "INGREDIENT"], [354, 366, "QUANTITY"], [367, 371, "INGREDIENT"], [372, 383, "QUANTITY"], [384, 387, "INGREDIENT"], [405, 418, "INGREDIENT"], [428, 441, "INGREDIENT"], [451, 462, "INGREDIENT"], [488, 493, "INGREDIENT"], [498, 501, "PROCESS"], [502, 507, "INGREDIENT"], [512, 522, "QUANTITY"], [523, 528, "INGREDIENT"], [593, 598, "PROCESS"], [654, 659, "PROCESS"], [664, 667, "INGREDIENT"], [669, 675, "INGREDIENT"], [677, 682, "INGREDIENT"], [687, 692, "INGREDIENT"], [746, 752, "INGREDIENT"], [753, 756, "PROCESS"], [764, 769, "INGREDIENT"], [770, 773, "PROCESS"], [778, 783, "PROCESS"], [891, 895, "INGREDIENT"], [989, 1002, "INGREDIENT"], [1030, 1034, "PROCESS"], [1170, 1183, "INGREDIENT"], [1188, 1192, "INGREDIENT"], [1193, 1198, "INGREDIENT"], [1283, 1287, "INGREDIENT"], [1327, 1333, "PROCESS"], [1348, 1354, "PROCESS"], [1362, 1370, "PROCESS"], [1407, 1412, "INGREDIENT"], [1428, 1431, "INGREDIENT"], [1445, 1454, "INGREDIENT"], [1464, 1472, "PROCESS"], [1487, 1492, "INGREDIENT"], [1509, 1514, "PROCESS"], [1620, 1625, "PROCESS"], [1661, 1666, "INGREDIENT"], [1667, 1671, "PROCESS"], [1788, 1793, "PROCESS"], [1884, 1891, "PROCESS"]]}]
