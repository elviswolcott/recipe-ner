["Ingredients:\n3 tablespoons all-purpose flour\n2 teaspoons tapioca starch (or corn starch)\n1 pinch fine salt\n6 tablespoons water\n1  scallion, finely chopped\nvegetable oil, for frying\n1/4 cup chickpea (garbanzo bean) flour, I used Bob's Red Mill\n1/4 cup water\n1 pinch turmeric\n1 pinch white pepper\n1 pinch salt (or black salt, kala namak)\n1 tablespoon soy sauce\n1 tablespoon doubanjiang (spicy broad bean paste)\n\nInstructions:\nMake the Crepe Batter. First, combine the all-purpose flour, tapioca starch (or corn starch), and salt. Then, gradually add the water while whisking (to avoid lumps). Whisk until a smooth batter forms. To finish, add the chopped scallions and set aside.\nMake the Chickpea \"Egg.\" First, slowly add water to the chickpea flour while whisking until a smooth mixture forms. Add the rest of the ingredients and adjust the color with turmeric \u00e2\u20ac\u201d be careful not to add too much!\nMake the Dan Bing. In a small-medium sized non-stick pan, heat a touch of vegetable oil on\u00c2\u00a0high heat.\u00c2\u00a0Pour the batter into the pan \u00e2\u20ac\u201d adjust the amount according to the size of your pan. The batter should just thinly coat the bottom of the pan. If your pan is too small, you may want to split it into two additions. When the top of the pancake has set (it will appear less transparent), pour the chickpea \"egg\" mixture on top. It should be spread out naturally to a thin layer (similar thickness to the pancake) like this:\nRoll up the Dan Bing. Unstick the sides of the crepe. When the crepe appears to no longer stick to the pan, start rolling it. I like to use a\u00c2\u00a0flipper\u00c2\u00a0and a pair of\u00c2\u00a0chopsticks\u00c2\u00a0to help me flip. This is the most difficult step \u00e2\u20ac\u201d be very careful! Once you have the crepe rolled up, keep the pan on\u00c2\u00a0high heat\u00c2\u00a0and fry it until both sides are crispy and golden brown.\u00c2\u00a0Once they are, remove the Dan Bing from the pan and let it cool a bit before slicing.", {"entities": [[13, 26, "QUANTITY"], [27, 44, "INGREDIENT"], [45, 56, "QUANTITY"], [57, 71, "INGREDIENT"], [76, 87, "INGREDIENT"], [97, 106, "INGREDIENT"], [107, 120, "QUANTITY"], [121, 126, "INGREDIENT"], [147, 154, "INGREDIENT"], [155, 180, "INGREDIENT"], [181, 188, "QUANTITY"], [189, 197, "INGREDIENT"], [214, 219, "INGREDIENT"], [243, 250, "QUANTITY"], [251, 256, "INGREDIENT"], [265, 273, "INGREDIENT"], [282, 294, "INGREDIENT"], [303, 307, "INGREDIENT"], [312, 322, "INGREDIENT"], [324, 334, "INGREDIENT"], [336, 348, "QUANTITY"], [349, 358, "INGREDIENT"], [359, 371, "QUANTITY"], [372, 383, "INGREDIENT"], [385, 407, "INGREDIENT"], [466, 483, "INGREDIENT"], [485, 499, "INGREDIENT"], [504, 515, "INGREDIENT"], [522, 527, "INGREDIENT"], [544, 547, "PROCESS"], [552, 557, "INGREDIENT"], [637, 640, "PROCESS"], [645, 662, "INGREDIENT"], [717, 720, "PROCESS"], [721, 726, "INGREDIENT"], [734, 748, "INGREDIENT"], [852, 860, "INGREDIENT"], [883, 886, "PROCESS"], [971, 984, "INGREDIENT"], [1296, 1304, "INGREDIENT"], [1366, 1370, "PROCESS"], [1739, 1742, "PROCESS"]]}]
