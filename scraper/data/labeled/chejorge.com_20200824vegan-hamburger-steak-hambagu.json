["Ingredients:\n80 grams cooked beetroot\n4 cloves garlic, finely minced\n1/2  yellow onion, finely minced\n60 grams TVP (textured vegetable protein), rehydrated & drained\n2 teaspoons blackstrap molasses*\n2 tablespoons light brown miso\n1 cup panko breadcrumbs\n1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt\n1 tablespoon vegetable oil\nJapanese curry\nteriyaki sauce (homemade recipe HERE)\n\nInstructions:\nPrepare TVP. Soak the TVP in warm water for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, drain the water and squeeze out all excess liquid from the re-hydrated TVP.\u00c2\u00a0\nPrepare other elements. Heat up a little bit of vegetable oil in a non-stick pan on medium-heat. Sweat together garlic & yellow onions until onions turn tender & translucent. Set aside and let cool. Next, using a knife, finely mince (or process with food processor) cooked beetroot until resembling puree. Set aside.\nMake the Hambagu Patties. In a large bowl, combine all Hambagu ingredients and mix with a spatula until well combined. Use damp hands to shape into four evenly-sized round patties. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.\nCook the Hambagu Patties. When you want to cook them, take them out of the fridge and let them sit on a room temperature counter for 5 minutes first. While waiting, heat up vegetable oil on\u00c2\u00a0high heat. Before placing the patties in, use your thumb to gently press down on the patty (to ensure minimal shrinkage). Sear the patties until both sides are\u00c2\u00a0deeply charred & caramelized. If your patties are tall, I recommend covering with a lid after the first flip to ensure the whole patty is cooked through. Serve warm with your favorite Japanese curry or teriyaki sauce.", {"entities": [[13, 21, "QUANTITY"], [22, 37, "INGREDIENT"], [40, 46, "INGREDIENT"], [47, 53, "INGREDIENT"], [62, 68, "INGREDIENT"], [81, 86, "INGREDIENT"], [95, 101, "INGREDIENT"], [102, 110, "QUANTITY"], [111, 114, "INGREDIENT"], [116, 142, "INGREDIENT"], [166, 177, "QUANTITY"], [178, 198, "INGREDIENT"], [199, 212, "QUANTITY"], [213, 229, "INGREDIENT"], [230, 235, "QUANTITY"], [236, 253, "INGREDIENT"], [254, 266, "QUANTITY"], [267, 280, "INGREDIENT"], [281, 293, "QUANTITY"], [294, 307, "INGREDIENT"], [317, 322, "INGREDIENT"], [323, 337, "INGREDIENT"], [384, 387, "INGREDIENT"], [398, 401, "INGREDIENT"], [405, 415, "INGREDIENT"], [460, 465, "INGREDIENT"], [576, 589, "INGREDIENT"], [640, 646, "INGREDIENT"], [656, 662, "INGREDIENT"], [669, 675, "INGREDIENT"], [794, 809, "INGREDIENT"], [827, 832, "INGREDIENT"], [924, 927, "PROCESS"], [1116, 1120, "PROCESS"], [1246, 1259, "INGREDIENT"], [1331, 1336, "PROCESS"], [1563, 1569, "PROCESS"], [1618, 1623, "INGREDIENT"], [1627, 1641, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
