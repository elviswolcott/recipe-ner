["Ingredients:\n2 cups Chopped tomatillos\n1 cup Chopped poblano (seed and stems removed before chopping)\n1 cup Chopped Onion\n1/2  Jalape\u00c3\u00b1o, without seeds (or use more to make it hotter)\n1 1/2 tsp. Ground cumin\n1 1/2 cups Dried Great Northern beans (soaked for 8-12 hours and drained)\n1 1/2 cups Water\n2 tsp. Dried oregano\nTo Taste Salt and Pepper\n\nInstructions:\nFor the saut\u00c3\u00a9, add the tomatillos, poblano, onion and jalape\u00c3\u00b1o to your blender or food processor. Pulse until the veggies are in tiny pieces, but not pureed.\nUse the saut\u00c3\u00a9 setting over normal, or medium heat, and pour in the blended veggies; add the cumin and stir to combine. Cook for about 4 minutes to remove the edge off the onions and make the cumin more fragrant.\nFor the pressure cooker, add the beans, water and oregano to the saut\u00c3\u00a9 mixture and stir to combine. Put the lid on and make sure that the steam release handle is sealed. Cook on manual setting at high pressure and set for 35 minutes.&nbsp;\nAllow the pressure to release naturally.\nIf there is still more liquid in the pot than you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to have, switch back to the saut\u00c3\u00a9 setting and simmer to allow some of the liquid to evaporate.\nAdd salt and pepper to taste before serving.", {"entities": [[13, 19, "QUANTITY"], [20, 38, "INGREDIENT"], [39, 44, "QUANTITY"], [45, 60, "INGREDIENT"], [102, 107, "QUANTITY"], [108, 121, "INGREDIENT"], [146, 151, "INGREDIENT"], [184, 193, "QUANTITY"], [195, 207, "INGREDIENT"], [208, 218, "QUANTITY"], [219, 245, "INGREDIENT"], [247, 253, "INGREDIENT"], [282, 292, "QUANTITY"], [293, 298, "INGREDIENT"], [299, 304, "QUANTITY"], [312, 319, "INGREDIENT"], [329, 333, "INGREDIENT"], [376, 379, "PROCESS"], [405, 410, "INGREDIENT"], [476, 483, "INGREDIENT"], [596, 603, "INGREDIENT"], [605, 608, "PROCESS"], [613, 618, "INGREDIENT"], [623, 627, "PROCESS"], [692, 698, "INGREDIENT"], [712, 717, "INGREDIENT"], [758, 761, "PROCESS"], [773, 778, "INGREDIENT"], [783, 790, "INGREDIENT"], [817, 821, "PROCESS"], [872, 877, "PROCESS"], [1174, 1178, "INGREDIENT"], [1183, 1189, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
