["Ingredients:\n1/4 cup full fat coconut milk\n1/2 tsp cornstarch (optional)\n2-3 Tbsp ground sugar\n1/2 cup vegan dark chocolate  (or vegan semi sweet chocolate)\n3/4 cup smooth almond butter\n1/2 tsp vanilla extract\n1/4 tsp cinnamon\n1  cup Coco whip or coconut cream\n\nInstructions:\nMix coconut milk with cornstarch and sugar and heat in a pan over medium heat until just about a boil. Take off heat and mix well so the sugar is well dissolved. Let it sit for 1 minute. Add the chocolate and let it sit for 1 more minute. Whisk until melted. Wait for the mixture to be warm to touch as some nut butters might separate when mixed in a hot mixture. Add in the almond butter and whisk and whisk until smooth using a hand mixer or whisk.\nAdd vanilla extract and cinnamon. Fold in the coconut cream and whisk and whip. Add more coconut cream and whip longer for a lighter mousse. Pour the mixture into ramekins. Let them chill for a few hours (this gives a great texture) before serving with a dollop of coco whip or vanilla ice cream.", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 42, "INGREDIENT"], [43, 50, "QUANTITY"], [51, 61, "INGREDIENT"], [75, 81, "QUANTITY"], [82, 94, "INGREDIENT"], [95, 102, "QUANTITY"], [103, 123, "INGREDIENT"], [129, 155, "INGREDIENT"], [157, 164, "QUANTITY"], [165, 185, "INGREDIENT"], [186, 193, "QUANTITY"], [194, 209, "INGREDIENT"], [210, 217, "QUANTITY"], [218, 226, "INGREDIENT"], [227, 233, "QUANTITY"], [234, 260, "INGREDIENT"], [280, 292, "INGREDIENT"], [298, 308, "INGREDIENT"], [313, 318, "INGREDIENT"], [373, 377, "PROCESS"], [397, 400, "PROCESS"], [413, 418, "INGREDIENT"], [471, 480, "INGREDIENT"], [616, 621, "PROCESS"], [651, 664, "INGREDIENT"], [669, 674, "PROCESS"], [679, 684, "PROCESS"], [720, 725, "PROCESS"], [731, 746, "INGREDIENT"], [751, 759, "INGREDIENT"], [773, 786, "INGREDIENT"], [791, 796, "PROCESS"], [816, 829, "INGREDIENT"], [1005, 1022, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
