["Ingredients:\n1/2 cup non dairy milk\n1/4 cup maple syrup\n2 tbsp sugar\n1 tsp active yeast\n2 tbsp coconut oil (refined for neutral flavor or use other oil)\n1 tsp vanilla extract\na generous pinch of nutmeg and cinnamon\n1 cup unbleached all purpose flour\n2 tbsp almond flour\n1 tsp baking powder\n1/4 tsp salt\n3 tbsp sugar\n3 tbsp non dairy milk\n2 tbsp refined coconut oil\n1/2 cup vegan semi sweet chocolate chips\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F / 180c. Grease a doughnut pan.\nWarm non dairy milk and maple and sugar in a saucepan or in a bowl in the microwave. The mixture should be jut warm to touch. Mix well to combine the sugar. Add yeast and mix in. Let sit for 5 mins to activate. Add oil, vanilla, spices and mix in.\nAdd flours, baking powder, salt and whisk well to make a smooth batter. Let the batter sit for 10 mins. It should increase in volume. Transfer to a ziplock. Snip one of the ends of the bag and pour into greased donut pan. Or use a spoon to fill the greased doughnut pan. I usually like to fill them a bit more than half to make thinner donuts rather than very tall results. Let the batter sit for 5 minutes.\nBake at 350 degrees F / 180c for 11 to 12 mins.\nCool for a minute. Tap to release, cool completely before adding a glaze.\nDip in prepared glaze and let it sit in a cool place for a few minutes to set.
