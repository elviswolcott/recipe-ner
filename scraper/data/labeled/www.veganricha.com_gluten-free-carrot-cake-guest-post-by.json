["Ingredients:\n1/2 cup (30g) Almond meal ((I skinned and ground almonds at home))\n1/2 cup (30g) Macadamia nuts (ground )\n1/2 cup (51g) Water Chestnut flour ((Singhada atta ))\n1/2 cup less 1 tbsp (55g) Raw cane sugar\n1  large carrot ((grated in medium size \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 1 cup, packed))\nA pinch of salt\n1 tsp Baking powder\n1/4 cup (41g) Olive oil (or any neutral flavoured oil )\n1/4 cup Coconut milk (or any other vegan milk substitute \u00e2\u20ac\u201c  cup (If thick, add 1/4cup of water. If thin use  cup coconut milk))\n1 tbsp Corn syrup\n1 tbsp Vinegar\n\nInstructions:\nPrepare pan by greasing with very little oil and dusting with flour.\nBlitz flour, ground nuts, cane sugar, grated carrots, baking powder and salt together for a minute to incorporate the baking powder into the dry ingredients and aerate the flour. Do not wait for the carrots to get ground finely. We just want to add some colour to the flour while retaining the mouth feel. Empty the mixture into a wide mixing bowl.\nNext blitz the olive oil, coconut milk, water (if adding), corn syrup, and vinegar. About a minute. This will form a thick emulsion.\nAdd the wet ingredients to the dry, and beat well to mix everything. The batter should be smooth and molten like lava. Pour into prepared pan leaving some space for the cake to rise and fill the tin. This cake does not rise as much as wholewheat or refined flour cakes do.\nBake for 30-35 minutes at 180 deg. Celsius. Check after 15 minutes to see whether there are any burn spots or over browning. If needed rotate the tin and bake further, or reduce temperature to 160 and bake for another 15-20 minutes, till a wooden skewer comes out clean.\nLet cool for 10 minutes in pan before removing.\nOptional dressing suggestion:\nI like to reduce the sugar further in the recipe, using  cup instead of . While the cake tastes less sweet, it allows me to drip sweet almond milk over it. That makes it tastier for me!", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [22, 25, "QUANTITY"], [27, 38, "INGREDIENT"], [55, 69, "INGREDIENT"], [80, 87, "QUANTITY"], [89, 92, "QUANTITY"], [94, 108, "INGREDIENT"], [110, 116, "INGREDIENT"], [119, 126, "QUANTITY"], [128, 131, "QUANTITY"], [133, 138, "INGREDIENT"], [148, 153, "INGREDIENT"], [173, 180, "QUANTITY"], [181, 192, "INGREDIENT"], [194, 197, "QUANTITY"], [203, 213, "INGREDIENT"], [223, 229, "INGREDIENT"], [232, 238, "INGREDIENT"], [258, 263, "QUANTITY"], [265, 271, "INGREDIENT"], [276, 289, "INGREDIENT"], [290, 295, "QUANTITY"], [296, 309, "INGREDIENT"], [310, 317, "QUANTITY"], [319, 322, "QUANTITY"], [324, 333, "INGREDIENT"], [360, 363, "INGREDIENT"], [366, 373, "QUANTITY"], [374, 386, "INGREDIENT"], [407, 411, "INGREDIENT"], [428, 431, "QUANTITY"], [443, 446, "PROCESS"], [454, 462, "INGREDIENT"], [467, 471, "PROCESS"], [477, 480, "QUANTITY"], [481, 493, "INGREDIENT"], [496, 502, "QUANTITY"], [503, 513, "INGREDIENT"], [514, 520, "QUANTITY"], [521, 528, "INGREDIENT"], [585, 588, "INGREDIENT"], [606, 611, "INGREDIENT"], [619, 624, "INGREDIENT"], [626, 632, "INGREDIENT"], [633, 637, "INGREDIENT"], [639, 649, "INGREDIENT"], [651, 665, "INGREDIENT"], [667, 680, "INGREDIENT"], [685, 689, "INGREDIENT"], [731, 744, "INGREDIENT"], [785, 790, "INGREDIENT"], [812, 819, "INGREDIENT"], [827, 833, "INGREDIENT"], [858, 861, "PROCESS"], [881, 886, "INGREDIENT"], [949, 955, "PROCESS"], [977, 986, "INGREDIENT"], [988, 1000, "INGREDIENT"], [1002, 1007, "INGREDIENT"], [1012, 1018, "PROCESS"], [1021, 1025, "INGREDIENT"], [1037, 1044, "INGREDIENT"], [1148, 1151, "PROCESS"], [1352, 1357, "INGREDIENT"], [1522, 1526, "PROCESS"], [1569, 1573, "PROCESS"], [1738, 1743, "INGREDIENT"], [1774, 1777, "QUANTITY"], [1852, 1863, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
