["Ingredients:\n3 cups cooked brown lentils (I usually cook them the night before. Or if you like you can also use canned lentils. )\n1  avocado, cut into slices\n2-3 handfuls fresh spinach\n1/2 cup walnuts, roughly chopped\n2 small apples, cut into small pieces\n1  pomegranate\n3 tablespoons tahini\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n1  clove of garlic\n6 tablespoons water\n4 tablespoons orange juice\n2 teaspoons orange zest\nsalt\nblack pepper\n\nInstructions:\nCook the lentils according to the instructions on the package.\nCut the pomegranate into halves and remove the seeds. I like to do this in a bowl of water because then it doesn't get all messy. Fill a large bowl with water.  Place halved pomegranate into the water. Use your fingers to break the seeds out. Remove the white fiber that floats at the top of the water.\nPut all ingredients into a big salad bowl.\nMake the dressing: Place all ingredients into a food processor or blender and process until smooth.\nPour the dressing over the lentil salad.", {"entities": [[13, 19, "QUANTITY"], [20, 40, "INGREDIENT"], [52, 56, "PROCESS"], [99, 102, "INGREDIENT"], [112, 118, "INGREDIENT"], [119, 126, "INGREDIENT"], [171, 184, "INGREDIENT"], [185, 192, "QUANTITY"], [193, 217, "INGREDIENT"], [271, 284, "QUANTITY"], [285, 291, "INGREDIENT"], [292, 305, "QUANTITY"], [306, 315, "INGREDIENT"], [328, 334, "INGREDIENT"], [335, 348, "QUANTITY"], [349, 354, "INGREDIENT"], [355, 368, "QUANTITY"], [369, 381, "INGREDIENT"], [382, 393, "QUANTITY"], [394, 405, "INGREDIENT"], [406, 410, "INGREDIENT"], [411, 423, "INGREDIENT"], [448, 455, "INGREDIENT"], [549, 554, "INGREDIENT"], [584, 592, "INGREDIENT"], [655, 660, "INGREDIENT"], [697, 702, "INGREDIENT"], [734, 739, "INGREDIENT"], [798, 803, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
