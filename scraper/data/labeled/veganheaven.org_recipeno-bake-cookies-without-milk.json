["Ingredients:\n1 cup dark chocolate, roughly chopped\n1/3 cup peanut butter\n1 1/3 cup rolled oats\n1 tablespoon almond milk or other plant-based milk ((optional but recommended) )\n\nInstructions:\nFirst, melt the chocolate (either use a microwave or melt it on the stovetop).\nOnce it's melted, stir in the oats and the peanut butter and add a splash of the plant-based milk if using. Stir until well combined.\nPut some parchment paper on a plate and evenly divide the no bake cookie batter. Form about six cookies and place them in the fridge for at least 2-3 hours, so they got enough time to harden up.", {"entities": [[13, 18, "QUANTITY"], [19, 50, "INGREDIENT"], [51, 58, "QUANTITY"], [59, 72, "INGREDIENT"], [73, 82, "QUANTITY"], [83, 94, "INGREDIENT"], [95, 107, "QUANTITY"], [108, 145, "INGREDIENT"], [207, 216, "INGREDIENT"], [288, 292, "PROCESS"], [300, 304, "INGREDIENT"], [313, 326, "INGREDIENT"], [331, 334, "PROCESS"], [351, 367, "INGREDIENT"], [465, 469, "PROCESS"], [512, 517, "PROCESS"]]}]
