["Ingredients:\n1  large red onion\n1  red bell pepper\n1  green bell pepper\n1  orange bell pepper\n1  yellow bell pepper\n1  zucchini\n6  button mushrooms\n1  corn cob\nfresh rosemary\nfresh oregano\nfresh thyme\n4 tablespoons olive oil\nsalt, to taste\nblack pepper, to taste\nred pepper flakes, to taste\n\nInstructions:\nSoak the wooden skewers in water while you prepare the vegetables.\u00c2\u00a0\nWash the vegetables and cut all of them into similar shaped pieces (see photos). Make sure they roughly have the same size and shape, so some pieces won&#x27;t take longer than others on the grill. The corn cobs are pretty hard to chop, so make sure to use a sharp knife.\u00c2\u00a0\nAssemble the chopped vegetables onto the wooden skewers. Start and end with a piece of red onion. Alternate between red onion, different colored bell peppers, and zucchini. I also added one button mushroom and a piece of corn to each skewer.\u00c2\u00a0\nLightly brush each skewer with olive oil.\u00c2\u00a0\nMake the marinade. Roughly chop the fresh herbs (rosemary, oregano, and thyme) and press the garlic. Place everything into a small bowl and add the olive oil, salt, and pepper. Stir well.\u00c2\u00a0\nDrizzle over the vegetable skewers.\u00c2\u00a0\nPreheat your grill. Once the grill is hot, place the skewers directly on the grill and grill them over medium heat for about 5 minutes on each side or until they&#x27;re the vegetables are soft and browning around the edges. This should take about 10-15 minutes. Make sure they don&#x27;t get too dark. Carefully turn them after 5 minutes using barbecue tongs.\u00c2\u00a0\nServe immediately. Drizzle with more marinade if you want.\u00c2\u00a0", {"entities": [[22, 31, "INGREDIENT"], [35, 50, "INGREDIENT"], [54, 71, "INGREDIENT"], [82, 93, "INGREDIENT"], [104, 115, "INGREDIENT"], [131, 147, "INGREDIENT"], [151, 155, "INGREDIENT"], [160, 174, "INGREDIENT"], [175, 188, "INGREDIENT"], [189, 200, "INGREDIENT"], [201, 214, "QUANTITY"], [215, 224, "INGREDIENT"], [225, 239, "INGREDIENT"], [240, 252, "INGREDIENT"], [263, 280, "INGREDIENT"], [333, 338, "INGREDIENT"], [361, 371, "INGREDIENT"], [384, 394, "INGREDIENT"], [566, 571, "PROCESS"], [577, 581, "INGREDIENT"], [662, 680, "INGREDIENT"], [736, 745, "INGREDIENT"], [765, 774, "INGREDIENT"], [794, 806, "INGREDIENT"], [829, 834, "PROCESS"], [846, 854, "INGREDIENT"], [870, 874, "INGREDIENT"], [878, 882, "INGREDIENT"], [907, 911, "INGREDIENT"], [924, 933, "INGREDIENT"], [973, 978, "INGREDIENT"], [979, 984, "INGREDIENT"], [986, 994, "INGREDIENT"], [996, 1003, "INGREDIENT"], [1009, 1014, "INGREDIENT"], [1020, 1025, "PROCESS"], [1030, 1036, "INGREDIENT"], [1077, 1080, "PROCESS"], [1085, 1094, "INGREDIENT"], [1096, 1100, "INGREDIENT"], [1106, 1112, "INGREDIENT"], [1178, 1183, "PROCESS"], [1194, 1199, "PROCESS"], [1208, 1213, "PROCESS"], [1242, 1247, "PROCESS"], [1252, 1257, "PROCESS"], [1303, 1307, "INGREDIENT"], [1339, 1349, "INGREDIENT"], [1510, 1518, "PROCESS"]]}]
