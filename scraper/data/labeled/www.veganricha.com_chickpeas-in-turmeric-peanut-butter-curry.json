Keep aside. I use a NutriBullet and the small amount works in the small blender. Alternatively, finely mince the onion, garlic and ginger as use.\nHeat oil in a skillet over medium heat. When hot, add cumin, coriander, cinnamon, cardamom, cayenne and cook until fragrant. 15 to 30 seconds.\nAdd in the onion puree to the skillet and mix. Mix in the turmeric and cook until the mixture is well roasted and onion does not smell raw. 7 to 9 minutes. Stir occasionally. (Cook at a slightly lower heat if using minced onion garlic).\nAdd in the nut butter, non dairy milk and mix in. it will take a half minute for the nut butter to mix. Add water. Mix well.\nAdd the veggies and chickpeas, salt, sugar. Mix, cover and bring to a boil. 4 mins. Reduce heat to medium low and continue to cook for 5 minutes. Mix in the lime juice and cilantro. Taste and adjust salt and heat. Add red pepper flakes to taste and mix in. At this point you can also mix in some baby greens, and adjust the curry consistency (add more non dairy milk or cook longer for thicker).\nContinue to simmer for another 3 to 4 minutes until the curry thickens a little. Serve over rice or cooked grains of choice.", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 34, "INGREDIENT"], [37, 43, "INGREDIENT"], [47, 53, "INGREDIENT"], [69, 75, "INGREDIENT"], [76, 83, "QUANTITY"], [84, 87, "INGREDIENT"], [88, 95, "QUANTITY"], [96, 108, "INGREDIENT"], [109, 116, "QUANTITY"], [117, 141, "INGREDIENT"], [142, 149, "QUANTITY"], [150, 158, "INGREDIENT"], [159, 166, "QUANTITY"], [167, 175, "INGREDIENT"], [187, 194, "QUANTITY"], [195, 210, "INGREDIENT"], [211, 218, "QUANTITY"], [219, 235, "INGREDIENT"], [236, 242, "QUANTITY"], [243, 264, "INGREDIENT"], [270, 283, "INGREDIENT"], [285, 292, "QUANTITY"], [293, 335, "INGREDIENT"], [336, 343, "QUANTITY"], [344, 358, "INGREDIENT"], [364, 379, "INGREDIENT"], [389, 396, "QUANTITY"], [397, 419, "INGREDIENT"], [420, 427, "QUANTITY"], [428, 456, "INGREDIENT"], [472, 477, "QUANTITY"], [478, 510, "INGREDIENT"], [524, 530, "INGREDIENT"], [539, 553, "INGREDIENT"], [555, 562, "QUANTITY"], [563, 575, "INGREDIENT"], [576, 581, "QUANTITY"], [582, 624, "INGREDIENT"], [632, 637, "QUANTITY"], [638, 648, "INGREDIENT"], [649, 656, "QUANTITY"], [657, 673, "INGREDIENT"], [682, 688, "QUANTITY"], [694, 699, "INGREDIENT"], [701, 714, "INGREDIENT"], [749, 754, "INGREDIENT"], [756, 762, "INGREDIENT"], [764, 770, "INGREDIENT"], [781, 787, "QUANTITY"], [788, 793, "INGREDIENT"], [921, 926, "INGREDIENT"], [928, 934, "INGREDIENT"], [939, 945, "INGREDIENT"], [959, 962, "INGREDIENT"], [1004, 1007, "PROCESS"], [1008, 1013, "INGREDIENT"], [1015, 1024, "INGREDIENT"], [1026, 1034, "INGREDIENT"], [1036, 1044, "INGREDIENT"], [1046, 1053, "INGREDIENT"], [1058, 1062, "PROCESS"], [1108, 1113, "INGREDIENT"], [1114, 1119, "INGREDIENT"], [1139, 1142, "PROCESS"], [1155, 1163, "INGREDIENT"], [1168, 1172, "PROCESS"], [1199, 1206, "PROCESS"], [1211, 1216, "INGREDIENT"], [1312, 1318, "INGREDIENT"], [1319, 1324, "INGREDIENT"], [1325, 1331, "INGREDIENT"], [1345, 1355, "INGREDIENT"], [1357, 1371, "INGREDIENT"], [1376, 1379, "PROCESS"], [1419, 1429, "INGREDIENT"], [1433, 1436, "PROCESS"], [1442, 1447, "INGREDIENT"], [1467, 1474, "INGREDIENT"], [1479, 1488, "INGREDIENT"], [1490, 1494, "INGREDIENT"], [1496, 1501, "INGREDIENT"], [1529, 1533, "PROCESS"], [1585, 1589, "PROCESS"], [1616, 1626, "INGREDIENT"], [1631, 1639, "INGREDIENT"], [1658, 1662, "INGREDIENT"], [1677, 1694, "INGREDIENT"], [1708, 1711, "PROCESS"], [1734, 1737, "INGREDIENT"], [1743, 1746, "PROCESS"], [1755, 1766, "INGREDIENT"], [1783, 1788, "INGREDIENT"], [1802, 1805, "PROCESS"], [1811, 1825, "INGREDIENT"], [1829, 1833, "PROCESS"], [1911, 1916, "INGREDIENT"], [1947, 1951, "INGREDIENT"], [1955, 1961, "PROCESS"]]}]
