["Ingredients:\n1.75 cups\u00c2\u00a0 flour ((I use a mix of 3/4 cup wheat and 1 cup all purpose), See GF option in Notes below)\n1/2 cup coconut sugar (, or other fine sugar, add 2 tbsp more for sweeter)\n1 tsp cinnamon\n1 tsp pumpkin pie spice\n2 tsp baking powder\n1/4 tsp baking soda\n1/2 tsp salt\n1 cup fresh cranberries or mixed berries\n3/4  scant cup sweet potato puree ((I use canned puree), or use well mashed boiled or steamed sweet potato)\n3/4 cup non dairy milk\n1 tsp lime juice or apple cider vinegar\n3 tbsp oil or omit\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat your oven to 365F (185C). Line a loaf pan with baking paper and set aside.&nbsp;\nWhisk 1.5 cups flour with the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl.&nbsp;Add berries and mix.\nMix vinegar into the non-dairy milk. then add it to the dry ingredients. Add sweet potato puree and oil and mix well to combine into a smooth batter. If the batter is too thin then add more flour a few tbsp at a time. (If you are baking muffins, you can keep the batter less stiff. For loafs or larger volume baking, you want the batter to be thicker, stiff with a more dry to moist ratio ad the sweet potato puree will leak moisture during baking.)**\nSpoon the sweet potato bread dough into your prepared loaf pan. (Add a streusel&nbsp;if you like. )\nBake at 365 deg F (185 C) for 55 to 60 mins. (25 mins for muffins). Check with a toothpick from the center. Cool for 10 mins then remove from pan and cool completely before slicing.&nbsp;Store on the counter for the day and refrigerated for upto a 5 days.", {"entities": [[25, 30, "INGREDIENT"], [41, 44, "PROCESS"], [48, 55, "QUANTITY"], [56, 83, "INGREDIENT"], [116, 123, "QUANTITY"], [124, 137, "INGREDIENT"], [155, 160, "INGREDIENT"], [162, 165, "PROCESS"], [166, 172, "QUANTITY"], [173, 189, "INGREDIENT"], [191, 196, "QUANTITY"], [197, 205, "INGREDIENT"], [206, 211, "QUANTITY"], [212, 229, "INGREDIENT"], [230, 235, "QUANTITY"], [236, 249, "INGREDIENT"], [250, 257, "QUANTITY"], [258, 269, "INGREDIENT"], [270, 277, "QUANTITY"], [278, 282, "INGREDIENT"], [283, 288, "QUANTITY"], [289, 323, "INGREDIENT"], [335, 338, "QUANTITY"], [339, 357, "INGREDIENT"], [366, 372, "INGREDIENT"], [373, 378, "INGREDIENT"], [393, 399, "INGREDIENT"], [400, 406, "PROCESS"], [410, 417, "PROCESS"], [418, 430, "INGREDIENT"], [432, 439, "QUANTITY"], [440, 454, "INGREDIENT"], [455, 460, "QUANTITY"], [461, 494, "INGREDIENT"], [495, 501, "QUANTITY"], [502, 513, "INGREDIENT"], [584, 590, "PROCESS"], [633, 638, "INGREDIENT"], [675, 681, "PROCESS"], [709, 712, "PROCESS"], [718, 725, "INGREDIENT"], [735, 749, "INGREDIENT"], [756, 759, "PROCESS"], [791, 809, "INGREDIENT"], [814, 817, "INGREDIENT"], [822, 825, "PROCESS"], [885, 889, "PROCESS"], [895, 898, "PROCESS"], [904, 909, "INGREDIENT"], [944, 950, "PROCESS"], [964, 967, "INGREDIENT"], [1023, 1029, "PROCESS"], [1110, 1128, "INGREDIENT"], [1155, 1161, "PROCESS"], [1176, 1188, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
