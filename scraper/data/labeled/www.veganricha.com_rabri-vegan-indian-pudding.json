["Ingredients:\n1/2 cup coconut milk\n1/2 cup oat milk\n1/4 cup raw cashews (soaked in warm water for 15 mins)\n2 tablespoons raw pistachios\n1 1/4 cups water (2 cups of water if you like you rabri a bit thinner)\n7 to 8  saffron strands\nseeds of 1 green cardamom pod\n1/4 cup sugar\n2 tablespoons almond flour\na good pinch of salt\n1 to 2 tablespoons chopped raw pistachios or chopped pistachios and almonds for garnish\n\nInstructions:\nBlend the coconut milk, oat milk, cashews, pistachios, water, saffron , seeds of the cardamom pod until well blended.\nI usually blend it for a minute then let the mixture sit for 5 minutes for the nuts to rehydrate. Then I blend again for 30 seconds and I do this again once or twice until the mixture is incredibly smooth.\nAdd this mixture to a saucepan over medium heat and bring to a boil stirring occasionally.\nThen add in your almond flour, salt, and sugar and mix in the mixture. After it has come to a boil, the mixture will tend to thicken and stick to the sides. So keep stirring.\nReduce the heat to medium-low. Let the mixture dry a little bit on the edges and then mix it in after half a minute and continue to cook for another 3-4 minutes this way or until the mixture is thickened to preference.\nTake off heat. Let it cool for a few minutes. Let a film form over the mixture, mix that and repeat this a couple of times until the mixture is just about lukewarm.\nThen transfer it to your serving bowls. Top it with the pistachios and almonds and serve as is or chill and serve.", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 33, "INGREDIENT"], [34, 41, "QUANTITY"], [42, 50, "INGREDIENT"], [51, 58, "QUANTITY"], [59, 70, "INGREDIENT"], [72, 78, "INGREDIENT"], [82, 92, "INGREDIENT"], [106, 119, "QUANTITY"], [120, 134, "INGREDIENT"], [135, 145, "QUANTITY"], [146, 151, "INGREDIENT"], [153, 159, "QUANTITY"], [160, 168, "INGREDIENT"], [214, 229, "INGREDIENT"], [230, 235, "INGREDIENT"], [247, 255, "INGREDIENT"], [260, 267, "QUANTITY"], [268, 273, "INGREDIENT"], [274, 287, "QUANTITY"], [288, 300, "INGREDIENT"], [308, 321, "INGREDIENT"], [327, 340, "QUANTITY"], [341, 409, "INGREDIENT"], [435, 447, "INGREDIENT"], [449, 457, "INGREDIENT"], [459, 466, "INGREDIENT"], [480, 485, "INGREDIENT"], [487, 494, "INGREDIENT"], [497, 502, "INGREDIENT"], [510, 518, "INGREDIENT"], [622, 626, "INGREDIENT"], [812, 816, "PROCESS"], [817, 825, "PROCESS"], [845, 848, "PROCESS"], [857, 869, "INGREDIENT"], [871, 875, "INGREDIENT"], [881, 886, "INGREDIENT"], [891, 894, "PROCESS"], [934, 938, "PROCESS"], [1005, 1013, "PROCESS"], [1101, 1104, "PROCESS"], [1147, 1151, "PROCESS"], [1209, 1218, "PROCESS"], [1314, 1317, "PROCESS"], [1470, 1477, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
