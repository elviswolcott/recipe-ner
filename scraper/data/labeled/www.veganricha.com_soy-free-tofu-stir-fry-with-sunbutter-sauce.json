["Ingredients:\n2 tsp oil (divided)\n1/2 recipe chickpea flour tofu ((1.25 cups cubed, or use firm tofu if using soy))\n1.5 cups veggies such as pepper (carrots, green beans, zucchini)\n6 to 8 oz noodles or rice to serve\n4 tbsp sunbutter ((sunflower seed butter), or use oeanut, almond or cashew butter for nut sauce.)\n1/2 tsp salt\n2 tsp sriracha\n2 tsp maple syrup or sugar\n1.5 tbsp lemon juice\n1 tsp rice vinegar (, optional)\n2 cloves of garlic or 1/2 tsp garlic powder\n1 tbsp ginger (, chopped fresh ginger)\n1 tsp sesame oil\n1/2 cup coconut milk (+ 1/2 cup water to rinse(used later))\n\nInstructions:\nPrepare your chickpea tofu if you havent already and chill for 15 mins then cube. Blend sunbutter sauce with 1/2 cup coconut milk and set aside.\nHeat oil in a skillet over medium heat. When it has heated, add cubed chickpea tofu and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. (You can toss the chickpea tofu in 1 tbsp cornstarch before roasting to make it crispier). Remove from the skillet. This helps the chickpea tofu hold shape and not get sticky in hot sauces.&nbsp;\nAdd veggies and a teaspoon of oil and cook for another 3 to 5 minutes. Add a generous dash of black pepper and mix in. Then add the chickpea tofu.\nAdd the blended sunbutter sauce then use 1/2 cup of water to rinse out the blender and add the water to the skillet. Mix and cook for 5 minutes. Adjust salt and heat to taste. Add more water or coconut milk if it's thickening too quickly or for thinner consistency.(sauce thickens on cooling)&nbsp;\nServe over noodles or rice, lettuce, with lemon/lime juice, sriracha or pepper flakes and cilantro.&nbsp;", {"entities": [[13, 18, "QUANTITY"], [19, 22, "INGREDIENT"], [44, 58, "INGREDIENT"], [59, 63, "INGREDIENT"], [76, 112, "INGREDIENT"], [124, 146, "INGREDIENT"], [148, 155, "INGREDIENT"], [157, 168, "INGREDIENT"], [185, 189, "QUANTITY"], [190, 214, "INGREDIENT"], [215, 221, "QUANTITY"], [222, 231, "INGREDIENT"], [234, 255, "INGREDIENT"], [283, 296, "INGREDIENT"], [313, 320, "QUANTITY"], [321, 325, "INGREDIENT"], [326, 331, "QUANTITY"], [332, 340, "INGREDIENT"], [341, 346, "QUANTITY"], [347, 367, "INGREDIENT"], [377, 388, "INGREDIENT"], [389, 394, "QUANTITY"], [395, 407, "INGREDIENT"], [423, 429, "INGREDIENT"], [433, 439, "INGREDIENT"], [443, 450, "QUANTITY"], [451, 464, "INGREDIENT"], [465, 471, "QUANTITY"], [472, 478, "INGREDIENT"], [482, 502, "INGREDIENT"], [504, 509, "QUANTITY"], [510, 520, "INGREDIENT"], [521, 528, "QUANTITY"], [529, 541, "INGREDIENT"], [545, 552, "QUANTITY"], [553, 558, "INGREDIENT"], [609, 622, "INGREDIENT"], [684, 693, "INGREDIENT"], [705, 712, "QUANTITY"], [713, 725, "INGREDIENT"], [746, 749, "INGREDIENT"], [801, 804, "PROCESS"], [805, 810, "INGREDIENT"], [811, 824, "INGREDIENT"], [829, 833, "PROCESS"], [859, 862, "INGREDIENT"], [872, 885, "INGREDIENT"], [889, 895, "QUANTITY"], [896, 906, "INGREDIENT"], [914, 922, "PROCESS"], [985, 998, "INGREDIENT"], [1054, 1061, "INGREDIENT"], [1077, 1083, "INGREDIENT"], [1088, 1092, "PROCESS"], [1141, 1156, "INGREDIENT"], [1161, 1164, "PROCESS"], [1174, 1177, "PROCESS"], [1182, 1195, "INGREDIENT"], [1213, 1222, "INGREDIENT"], [1238, 1245, "QUANTITY"], [1249, 1279, "INGREDIENT"], [1284, 1287, "PROCESS"], [1292, 1297, "INGREDIENT"], [1322, 1326, "PROCESS"], [1349, 1353, "INGREDIENT"], [1382, 1403, "INGREDIENT"], [1518, 1522, "INGREDIENT"], [1544, 1554, "INGREDIENT"], [1556, 1564, "INGREDIENT"], [1568, 1581, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
