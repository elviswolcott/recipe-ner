["Ingredients:\n3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour\n1 1/2 teaspoons quick-rise instant yeast\n1/4 cup brown sugar\n1 cup water\n1 tablespoon oil\n1 pinch of salt\n5 cups water\n3 tablespoons baking soda\n2 tablespoons melted coconut oil\nsea salt\n1 bar of  dark chocolate ((make sure it's vegan))\n\nInstructions:\nIn a large bowl, combine all ingredients for the dough and knead the dough with your hands for about 5 minutes. Form it into a ball and cover the bowl with a towel. Let the dough rise for an hour.\nDivide the dough into three parts and roll each part in your hands so you got a long roll. Each roll should be around 1 inch wide.  Place the rolls on a lightly floured work surface. Use a pizza cutter and cut the roll into bites (about 1 inch big). You should have around 20 bites.\nMake the baking soda \"bath\": Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Bring the water to a rapid simmer, then add the baking soda. Stir to dissolve the baking soda. Lower about 5 pretzel bites at a time into the baking soda \"bath\" and simmer for 30 seconds. Place the pretzel bites on the baking sheet. Add the next batch until you're done.\nOnce all the pretzels have been dipped in the water bath, brush them with the melted coconut oil and sprinkle them with sea salt.\nPreheat the oven to 350 F. Bake the pretzel bites for 10-12 minutes or until they're brown.\nMelt the chocolate either in the microwave or on the stovetop. Serve together with the pretzels.
