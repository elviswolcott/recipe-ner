["Ingredients:\n12 ounces uncooked short cut pasta (I used rotini)\n1 Recipe Vegan Pesto\n1 1/2 cups arugula\n2 cups cherry tomatoes, halved\n2 cups cubed vegan mozzarella, optional\nsalt + pepper, to taste\n\nInstructions:\nCook pasta according to package instructions. Drain and rinse with cold water.\nAdd the pasta to a large bowl. If using my homemade Vegan Pesto, make sure it&#039;s not too thick when you add it. Add additional water or olive oil and whisk first in a medium bowl, then add to the pasta and stir until the noodles are coated.\nFold in the halved tomatoes, arugula and vegan cheese cubes, if using. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.\nRight before serving, stir one more time, adding a little more olive oil or water if the mixture seems a bit dry. It can be stored in the refrigerator for 4-5 days. Enjoy!", {"entities": [[13, 22, "QUANTITY"], [23, 47, "INGREDIENT"], [56, 62, "INGREDIENT"], [85, 95, "QUANTITY"], [96, 103, "INGREDIENT"], [104, 110, "QUANTITY"], [111, 134, "INGREDIENT"], [135, 141, "QUANTITY"], [142, 174, "INGREDIENT"], [175, 179, "INGREDIENT"], [182, 188, "INGREDIENT"], [219, 224, "INGREDIENT"], [281, 291, "INGREDIENT"], [301, 306, "INGREDIENT"], [401, 404, "PROCESS"], [424, 429, "INGREDIENT"], [433, 442, "INGREDIENT"], [447, 452, "PROCESS"], [482, 485, "PROCESS"], [493, 498, "INGREDIENT"], [503, 507, "PROCESS"], [557, 565, "INGREDIENT"], [567, 574, "INGREDIENT"], [579, 591, "INGREDIENT"], [630, 634, "INGREDIENT"], [639, 645, "INGREDIENT"], [713, 717, "PROCESS"], [733, 739, "PROCESS"], [754, 763, "INGREDIENT"], [767, 772, "INGREDIENT"], [808, 811, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
