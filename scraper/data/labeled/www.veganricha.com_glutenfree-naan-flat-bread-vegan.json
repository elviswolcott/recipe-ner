Add salt, agave and oil and mix well to combine.&nbsp;Add a tablespoon of water at a time to make a thick batter (not really flowy) .Spray top with water so the dough doesnt dry out.\nCover with damp towel or plastic wrap with enough space to double, and Let sit in warm place for 1.5-2 hours or until doubled.\nThe batter will turn doughy because Oats will absorb the extra moisture.\nOil hands and pick the dough up and gather into 1 or 2 balls. You can make two, 6 inch flat breads, a bit less than 1/4 inch thick. I made one 8 inch 1/4 inch thick and a small dinner roll&nbsp;\nPat the dough into desired shape on parchment. Use parchment size that will fit in your steamer and leave some space for the steam to circulate.\nSprinkle some seeds on top and pat them in.\nSpritz top with water. Cover with towel and let rise for 45 minutes to an hour, until almost double.(Let is Rise well. (below, after 45 minutes of rising)\nStart up the steamer. Place parchment on steamer tray. Place steamer in container when water is boiling(steam is getting produced continuously).\nCover and steam for 12-14 minutes.\nCarefully lift tray or parchment out. Lift up the flatbread and flip it and place on dry parchment, so the bottom doesnt get soggy. (below, parchment has been peeled off the bottom)\nYou can leave it be at this point and serve after a minute. Or do a quick grill.&nbsp;\nStart up a pan on high heat. Place the flat bread with bottom on heated pan.&nbsp;Cook for half a minute. Flip and cook for another half a minute.\nLet bread cool for half a minute before serving. Serve hot with any favorite indian curries or lentil soups. or cut it up to use as pita or a side.", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 42, "INGREDIENT"], [48, 58, "INGREDIENT"], [60, 67, "QUANTITY"], [68, 81, "INGREDIENT"], [82, 92, "QUANTITY"], [93, 105, "INGREDIENT"], [106, 118, "QUANTITY"], [119, 132, "INGREDIENT"], [133, 145, "QUANTITY"], [146, 150, "INGREDIENT"], [151, 162, "QUANTITY"], [163, 174, "INGREDIENT"], [175, 187, "QUANTITY"], [188, 206, "INGREDIENT"], [207, 214, "QUANTITY"], [215, 250, "INGREDIENT"], [251, 263, "QUANTITY"], [264, 276, "INGREDIENT"], [277, 289, "QUANTITY"], [290, 302, "INGREDIENT"], [303, 315, "QUANTITY"], [316, 348, "INGREDIENT"], [369, 381, "INGREDIENT"], [408, 411, "PROCESS"], [416, 430, "INGREDIENT"], [435, 440, "INGREDIENT"], [499, 504, "PROCESS"], [505, 509, "INGREDIENT"], [510, 515, "INGREDIENT"], [517, 530, "INGREDIENT"], [532, 545, "INGREDIENT"], [547, 552, "INGREDIENT"], [554, 558, "INGREDIENT"], [560, 573, "INGREDIENT"], [574, 586, "INGREDIENT"], [633, 638, "INGREDIENT"], [639, 642, "PROCESS"], [648, 652, "INGREDIENT"], [654, 659, "INGREDIENT"], [664, 667, "INGREDIENT"], [672, 675, "PROCESS"], [715, 723, "INGREDIENT"], [792, 797, "INGREDIENT"], [860, 864, "PROCESS"], [914, 919, "PROCESS"], [990, 994, "INGREDIENT"], [1027, 1030, "INGREDIENT"], [1093, 1096, "INGREDIENT"], [1347, 1352, "PROCESS"], [1381, 1386, "INGREDIENT"], [1427, 1432, "INGREDIENT"], [1653, 1658, "INGREDIENT"], [1721, 1726, "PROCESS"], [1822, 1827, "PROCESS"], [1932, 1935, "INGREDIENT"], [2130, 2134, "PROCESS"]]}]
