["Ingredients:\n1 cup all purpose flour\n1/2 cup granulated sugar\n1 teaspoon baking powder\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n1/2  cup + 2 tablespoons soy milk\n1 tablespoon applesauce\n1 tablespoon melted vegan butter\n1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n1/2 cup granulated sugar\n1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n1/4 cup melted vegan butter\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F and spray a donut pan with non-stick spray.\nWhisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and cinnamon in a large bowl. Pour the soy milk, applesauce, melted vegan butter (1 tablespoon) and vanilla into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Mix well with a large wooden spoon to combine. The batter will be similar to cake batter; not too thick but not very runny either.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nSpoon the batter into the donut pan, OR fill a large ziplock bag with the batter, cut a hole in the corner and pipe into the pan, filling about 3/4 of the way full. Be careful not to overfill, as the donuts will rise and you might lose the &quot;hole&quot; of your donut.\u00c2\u00a0\nBake for 9-10 minutes or until the edges are lightly golden brown. If your donut pan is larger than mine, they could take a few extra minutes to bake. Let cool for two or three minutes in the pan, then carefully transfer to a wire rack with a large piece of parchment paper beneath it (to help with the mess).", {"entities": [[13, 18, "QUANTITY"], [19, 36, "INGREDIENT"], [37, 44, "QUANTITY"], [45, 61, "INGREDIENT"], [62, 72, "QUANTITY"], [73, 86, "INGREDIENT"], [87, 99, "QUANTITY"], [100, 104, "INGREDIENT"], [105, 117, "QUANTITY"], [118, 133, "INGREDIENT"], [134, 142, "QUANTITY"], [143, 167, "INGREDIENT"], [168, 180, "QUANTITY"], [181, 191, "INGREDIENT"], [192, 204, "QUANTITY"], [205, 224, "INGREDIENT"], [225, 235, "QUANTITY"], [236, 256, "INGREDIENT"], [257, 264, "QUANTITY"], [265, 281, "INGREDIENT"], [282, 292, "QUANTITY"], [293, 308, "INGREDIENT"], [309, 316, "QUANTITY"], [317, 336, "INGREDIENT"], [440, 445, "INGREDIENT"], [447, 452, "INGREDIENT"], [454, 467, "INGREDIENT"], [469, 473, "INGREDIENT"], [478, 486, "INGREDIENT"], [513, 521, "INGREDIENT"], [523, 533, "INGREDIENT"], [535, 554, "INGREDIENT"], [556, 568, "QUANTITY"], [574, 581, "INGREDIENT"], [1184, 1188, "PROCESS"]]}]
