["Ingredients:\n1 Recipe Vegan Vanilla Cake (with cake flour if possible)\n1 Recipe Vegan Custard\n1 cup vegan chocolate chips\n1/2 cup vegan creamer*\n2 tablespoons corn syrup, optional\n\nInstructions:\nPrepare vegan vanilla cake according to instructions. Let the cakes cool completely before filling with custard layer.\nPrepare the vegan custard and let it chill in the refrigerator while the cakes cool, about an hour.\nOnce the cakes have cooled, remove the custard from the refrigerator and use a hand mixer, or stand mixer with whisk attachment and mix to make it smooth again. It can get a little clumpy while chilling.\nPlace one of the cake layers on a serving plate, then spread most of the thickened custard over the cake, saving 1/2 cup or a little more. Place the other cake layer on top and gently push down, just a little so it sticks.\nTo get the thick custard look from the outside of the cake, fill in any empty spots with more custard, using a butter knife. You could skip this part, it just makes the cake prettier for presentation. Spread it on smoothly, until it looks even all the way around.", {"entities": [[47, 57, "INGREDIENT"], [94, 99, "QUANTITY"], [100, 121, "INGREDIENT"], [122, 129, "QUANTITY"], [130, 144, "INGREDIENT"], [145, 158, "QUANTITY"], [159, 179, "INGREDIENT"], [209, 216, "INGREDIENT"], [525, 530, "PROCESS"], [546, 549, "PROCESS"], [578, 581, "INGREDIENT"], [691, 700, "PROCESS"], [731, 738, "QUANTITY"], [952, 958, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
