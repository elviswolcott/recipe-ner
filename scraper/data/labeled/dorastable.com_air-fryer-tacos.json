Remove from the heat. Place the soy curls in a heat proof bowl and pour the broth over them. Using a spoon press down on the soy curls to make sure they absorb all the liquid. Let rest for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.\nPlace the soy sauce, garlic, onion, smoked paprika, and water in the blender and process until smooth. Set aside.\nPlace 1/3 of the soy curls in the blender and pulse until the soy curls shred and resemble shredded meat. Repeat this with the rest of the soy curls.\nHeat avocado oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the shredded soy curls and saut\u00c3\u00a9 until golden brown, about 6 minutes. Pour in seasoning sauce and stir to combine. Continue cooking until almost all the liquid has evaporated. Remove from heat and set aside.\nPreheat your air fryer to 400F. Heat your tortillas in the microwave or on a griddle until they are soft enough to roll. Fill with about 1 tbsp. of shredded soy curls and roll tightly. Secure with a toothpick or place seam side down on the rack of your air fryer. Spray lightly with avocado oil (optional) and cook for 10 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 12 min. until golden brown.\nWhile the tacos are cooking, place the cabbage in a large bowl and pour in the lime juice, white vinegar, salt and water. Stir to combine and let sit until you are ready to eat your tacos.\nRemove the tacos from the air fryer and top with salsa verde, almond crema, pickled cabbage, and sliced tomatoes. Serve with pickled jalape\u00c3\u00b1os on the side.", {"entities": [[13, 17, "QUANTITY"], [18, 40, "INGREDIENT"], [41, 47, "QUANTITY"], [48, 63, "INGREDIENT"], [64, 71, "QUANTITY"], [72, 81, "INGREDIENT"], [85, 91, "INGREDIENT"], [92, 98, "INGREDIENT"], [104, 109, "INGREDIENT"], [112, 116, "QUANTITY"], [119, 126, "QUANTITY"], [128, 142, "INGREDIENT"], [143, 150, "QUANTITY"], [151, 156, "INGREDIENT"], [157, 162, "QUANTITY"], [164, 175, "INGREDIENT"], [194, 198, "INGREDIENT"], [227, 235, "INGREDIENT"], [237, 241, "QUANTITY"], [264, 267, "QUANTITY"], [268, 281, "INGREDIENT"], [283, 286, "QUANTITY"], [287, 292, "INGREDIENT"], [293, 300, "QUANTITY"], [302, 315, "INGREDIENT"], [324, 332, "INGREDIENT"], [335, 339, "QUANTITY"], [342, 347, "QUANTITY"], [348, 360, "INGREDIENT"], [361, 366, "QUANTITY"], [367, 378, "INGREDIENT"], [380, 383, "QUANTITY"], [444, 459, "INGREDIENT"], [505, 514, "INGREDIENT"], [549, 554, "INGREDIENT"], [580, 585, "PROCESS"], [598, 607, "INGREDIENT"], [674, 682, "PROCESS"], [707, 717, "INGREDIENT"], [718, 724, "INGREDIENT"], [726, 731, "INGREDIENT"], [733, 747, "INGREDIENT"], [753, 758, "INGREDIENT"], [828, 837, "INGREDIENT"], [873, 882, "INGREDIENT"], [902, 910, "INGREDIENT"], [950, 959, "INGREDIENT"], [966, 977, "INGREDIENT"], [1027, 1035, "INGREDIENT"], [1036, 1045, "INGREDIENT"], [1122, 1126, "PROCESS"], [1148, 1155, "PROCESS"], [1369, 1375, "QUANTITY"], [1380, 1388, "INGREDIENT"], [1389, 1398, "INGREDIENT"], [1444, 1449, "PROCESS"], [1515, 1526, "INGREDIENT"], [1542, 1546, "PROCESS"], [1606, 1613, "PROCESS"], [1615, 1620, "PROCESS"], [1665, 1675, "INGREDIENT"], [1677, 1690, "INGREDIENT"], [1692, 1696, "INGREDIENT"], [1701, 1706, "INGREDIENT"], [1824, 1835, "INGREDIENT"], [1837, 1849, "INGREDIENT"], [1879, 1887, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
