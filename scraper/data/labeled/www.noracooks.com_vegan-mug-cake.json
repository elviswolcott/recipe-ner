["Ingredients:\n2 tablespoons all purpose flour\n2 tablespoons cocoa powder\n2 tablespoons granulated sugar\n1/8  teaspoon salt\n1/4 teaspoon baking powder\n1 tablespoon canola oil, melted coconut oil or vegan butter\n3 tablespoons non-dairy milk\n1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n2 tablespoons dairy free chocolate chips\n\nInstructions:\nAdd the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, salt and baking powder to a mug. Stir or whisk to combine.\nPour in the oil, non-dairy milk and vanilla into the mug with the dry ingredients and stir well with a spoon. Sprinkle the chocolate chips on top.\nCook in the microwave for 40 seconds. It will likely be a little undercooked in the middle at this point, which is my preference, but if you want it cooked more, microwave it another 10-20 seconds.&nbsp;\nServe immediately.&nbsp;", {"entities": [[13, 26, "QUANTITY"], [27, 44, "INGREDIENT"], [45, 58, "QUANTITY"], [59, 71, "INGREDIENT"], [72, 85, "QUANTITY"], [86, 102, "INGREDIENT"], [103, 116, "QUANTITY"], [117, 121, "INGREDIENT"], [122, 134, "QUANTITY"], [135, 148, "INGREDIENT"], [149, 161, "QUANTITY"], [162, 208, "INGREDIENT"], [209, 222, "QUANTITY"], [223, 237, "INGREDIENT"], [238, 250, "QUANTITY"], [251, 271, "INGREDIENT"], [272, 285, "QUANTITY"], [286, 312, "INGREDIENT"], [336, 341, "INGREDIENT"], [343, 355, "INGREDIENT"], [357, 362, "INGREDIENT"], [364, 368, "INGREDIENT"], [373, 386, "INGREDIENT"], [405, 410, "PROCESS"], [435, 438, "INGREDIENT"], [440, 454, "INGREDIENT"], [459, 466, "INGREDIENT"], [509, 513, "PROCESS"], [546, 561, "INGREDIENT"], [719, 725, "PROCESS"]]}]
