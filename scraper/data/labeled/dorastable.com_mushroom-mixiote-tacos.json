Place in a bowl and pour boiling water over them. Let soak for 10 min.\nIn the meantime, bring a medium pot of water and salt to a boil and drop in the nopales. Boil for 8 - 10 minutes until the nopales are tender. Drain and run cold water over the nopales. Set aside.\nDrain the soaked chiles, but reserve 1 cup of the chile soaking liquid. Place the chiles, cumin, garlic, cloves, peppercorn, cinnamon, thyme, oregano, onion, avocado leaf, vinegar, and 1/2 cup of the chile soaking liquid in the blender and process until smooth. If necessary add the remaining 1/2 cup of chile soaking liquid to get the mixture to the consistency of a pur\u00c3\u00a9e. Strain.\nHeat a saucepot to medium-low heat and add the chile puree, simmer for 5-6 minutes, adjust seasoning, remove from heat, and let cool.\nIn a large bowl, combine the mushrooms, red onion, and nopales. Pour the chile puree on top and mix well to combine. Let marinate in the sauce for 30 min.\nRemove paper from water and lay out the pieces on a cutting board. Divide the mushroom mixture among the 6 pieces of paper, gather the edges of the paper together, and tie with butcher\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s twine.\nSetup up your steamer pot, fill the bottom with water, and place the mixiote packets on the steamer rack. Steam for 20 minutes or until the contents of the packets are bubbling and the mushrooms are tender.\nRemove mixiote from the steamer and serve your mixiote on warm corn tortillas and garnish with cilantro and your favorite salsa.", {"entities": [[154, 166, "QUANTITY"], [167, 179, "INGREDIENT"], [181, 188, "QUANTITY"], [190, 201, "INGREDIENT"], [205, 211, "INGREDIENT"], [272, 280, "INGREDIENT"], [296, 303, "QUANTITY"], [305, 312, "INGREDIENT"], [321, 328, "QUANTITY"], [329, 334, "INGREDIENT"], [336, 341, "INGREDIENT"], [343, 350, "INGREDIENT"], [363, 368, "INGREDIENT"], [395, 402, "QUANTITY"], [403, 416, "INGREDIENT"], [432, 441, "INGREDIENT"], [481, 486, "QUANTITY"], [497, 502, "INGREDIENT"], [504, 510, "QUANTITY"], [522, 527, "INGREDIENT"], [529, 542, "INGREDIENT"], [548, 552, "INGREDIENT"], [563, 570, "QUANTITY"], [571, 587, "INGREDIENT"], [602, 607, "INGREDIENT"], [658, 667, "INGREDIENT"], [728, 736, "INGREDIENT"], [742, 746, "PROCESS"], [860, 873, "INGREDIENT"], [942, 950, "INGREDIENT"], [955, 959, "INGREDIENT"], [965, 969, "PROCESS"], [1063, 1073, "INGREDIENT"], [1113, 1119, "INGREDIENT"], [1140, 1145, "QUANTITY"], [1193, 1198, "INGREDIENT"], [1200, 1206, "INGREDIENT"], [1208, 1214, "INGREDIENT"], [1228, 1236, "INGREDIENT"], [1238, 1243, "INGREDIENT"], [1245, 1252, "INGREDIENT"], [1254, 1259, "INGREDIENT"], [1275, 1282, "INGREDIENT"], [1288, 1295, "QUANTITY"], [1378, 1381, "PROCESS"], [1396, 1403, "QUANTITY"], [1526, 1529, "PROCESS"], [1540, 1545, "INGREDIENT"], [1650, 1659, "INGREDIENT"], [1661, 1670, "INGREDIENT"], [1700, 1705, "INGREDIENT"], [1717, 1720, "PROCESS"], [1794, 1799, "INGREDIENT"], [1854, 1862, "INGREDIENT"], [2020, 2025, "INGREDIENT"], [2031, 2036, "PROCESS"], [2157, 2166, "INGREDIENT"], [2242, 2246, "INGREDIENT"], [2274, 2282, "INGREDIENT"], [2301, 2306, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
