["Ingredients:\n1 cup whole wheat flour  (or pastry flour or Spelt flour)\n1/2 cup unbleached white flour  (or all purpose flour)\n1 tbsp starch (cornstarch or arrowroot starch)\n3/4 tsp baking soda\n1/4 tsp salt\n1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cup mango puree (more if the puree is really thick)\n2/3 cup or more raw or vegan sugar or other sweetener (depends on sweetness of the mango puree)\n1 tsp vinegar (regular white or apple cider)\n2 tbsp oil\n1 tsp vanilla  (or 1/2 tsp ground cardamom or both)\n1/4 tsp turmeric (optional for color)\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F / 180c. Line a muffin pan with liners.\nIn a bowl, whisk all the dry ingredients really well.\nIn a blender add the mango puree, sugar, vinegar and blend well. Add a 1/4 tsp turmeric for color if needed and blend into the puree. (I generally use sweetened mango puree from a can or a combination (some fresh mango and some sweetened puree blended in) and use 1/2 to 2/3 cup sugar. If you use all fresh mango, use a very juicy ripe mango, puree them really well until smooth (with 2 to 4 tbsp water for blending and measure the blended puree). and add a bit more sugar if the mangoes are not very ripe (about 3/4 cup).)\nAdd oil, vanilla and 1 1/4 cup of the puree and mix in. Add more puree if needed to make a smooth flowy batter. Mix for at least 15 seconds so the batter is smooth.\nSpoon the batter into prepared muffin pan to 2/3 full.\nBake for 26 to 28 minutes. Cool completely and frost with frosting of choice.", {"entities": [[13, 18, "QUANTITY"], [19, 36, "INGREDIENT"], [49, 54, "INGREDIENT"], [58, 69, "INGREDIENT"], [71, 78, "QUANTITY"], [79, 101, "INGREDIENT"], [107, 124, "INGREDIENT"], [126, 132, "QUANTITY"], [133, 139, "INGREDIENT"], [141, 171, "INGREDIENT"], [173, 180, "QUANTITY"], [181, 192, "INGREDIENT"], [193, 200, "QUANTITY"], [201, 205, "INGREDIENT"], [215, 224, "QUANTITY"], [225, 236, "INGREDIENT"], [250, 255, "INGREDIENT"], [273, 280, "QUANTITY"], [281, 326, "INGREDIENT"], [356, 367, "INGREDIENT"], [369, 374, "QUANTITY"], [375, 382, "INGREDIENT"], [401, 412, "INGREDIENT"], [414, 420, "QUANTITY"], [421, 424, "INGREDIENT"], [425, 430, "QUANTITY"], [431, 438, "INGREDIENT"], [444, 451, "QUANTITY"], [452, 475, "INGREDIENT"], [477, 484, "QUANTITY"], [485, 493, "INGREDIENT"], [614, 619, "PROCESS"], [670, 673, "PROCESS"], [678, 689, "INGREDIENT"], [691, 696, "INGREDIENT"], [698, 705, "INGREDIENT"], [728, 735, "QUANTITY"], [736, 754, "INGREDIENT"], [784, 789, "INGREDIENT"], [818, 829, "INGREDIENT"], [837, 840, "INGREDIENT"], [864, 869, "INGREDIENT"], [895, 900, "INGREDIENT"], [928, 935, "QUANTITY"], [936, 941, "INGREDIENT"], [958, 963, "INGREDIENT"], [988, 998, "INGREDIENT"], [1000, 1005, "INGREDIENT"], [1047, 1053, "QUANTITY"], [1054, 1059, "INGREDIENT"], [1097, 1102, "INGREDIENT"], [1109, 1112, "PROCESS"], [1124, 1129, "INGREDIENT"], [1170, 1177, "QUANTITY"], [1185, 1188, "INGREDIENT"], [1190, 1197, "INGREDIENT"], [1202, 1211, "QUANTITY"], [1219, 1224, "INGREDIENT"], [1229, 1232, "PROCESS"], [1246, 1251, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
