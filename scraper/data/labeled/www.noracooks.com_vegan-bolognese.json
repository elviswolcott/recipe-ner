["Ingredients:\n2 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce (*use tamari for gluten free)\n1 jar your favorite marinara sauce (about 3 cups) (divided)\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n1 teaspoon smoked paprika\n1/2 teaspoon garlic powder\n1/2 teaspoon onion powder\n1 block firm or extra-firm tofu (14-16 oz)\n8 ounces spaghetti noodles or other pasta (*gluten free if needed)\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or spray well with oil.\nIn a large bowl, stir together the soy sauce, 2 tablespoons of the marinara sauce (adjust if doubling/halving the recipe), olive oil, smoked paprika, garlic powder and onion powder until well combined.\nNow drain the tofu from the package, pat with paper towels and crumble into the bowl with the sauce. You can use your hands OR use a potato masher to mash it right in the bowl.\nStir to coat the tofu crumbles in the sauce, then transfer to the prepared baking sheet, spreading it out into a layer (see photos above for visual reference). Bake in the center rack of the oven for 25-40 minutes, until chewy and golden in spots, but be careful not to burn it. You can give it a stir halfway, if the edges start to burn.\nWhile the tofu is baking, cook your pasta according to package instructions, then drain and set aside.\nAdd the rest of the marinara sauce to a medium sized pot and warm on low heat. Once the tofu is done baking, remove it from the oven and add to the pot with the marinara. Stir to make a meaty bolognese sauce!\nServe immediately over pasta, sprinkled with vegan parmesan, if desired, and some crusty bread.
