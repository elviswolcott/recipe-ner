["Ingredients:\n2 1/4 cup spelt flour\n1/3 cup almond milk\n0,7 oz yeast\n1/4 cup brown sugar or coconut sugar\n1/4 cup vegan margarine\n1 teaspoon cinnamon\n1  pinch salt\n2 small apples (about 7 oz)\n1 teaspoon vegan margarine\n1/2  teaspoon cinnamon\n1 tablespoon margarine\n2 teaspoons brown sugar or coconut sugar\n1 tablespoon cinnamon\n1/2 cup powdered sugar\n1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract\n1/2-1 teaspoon almond milk\n\nInstructions:\nFirst dissolve the yeast in warm almond milk (use about 2 tablespoons from the amount named in the ingredient list) and sugar (1 tablespoon from the amount named in the ingredient list).  In a bowl, combine the yeast-milk mixture with the flour.  Let it sit for a couple of minutes, in which you can melt the margarine and then also add it to the flour together with the remaining almond milk,  sugar, and cinnamon.\nThen knead the dough for about a minute or two. I used a hand mixer with dough hooks, but of course you can also use a classic stand mixer or just use your hands.\nLet the dough rise for about half an hour. Then make the filling: Cut the apples into small pieces. In a small pan, heat one teaspoon vegan margarine. Cook the apple for about 3 minutes and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. Set aside. Then melt the remaining margarine (1 tablespoon).\nRoll the dough into a rectangle (about 12 by 6 inch) and spread the melted margarine. Then sprinkle with sugar, cinnamon, and equally spread the apples. Roll up the cinnamon rolls and seal the edges.\nWith a sharp knife, cut the roll into exactly 12 pieces. Put them into muffin cups and bake at 375 degrees for 15 minutes (or until very slightly golden).\nIn the meantime make the frosting: Combine 1/2 cup powdered sugar, with half a teaspoon vanilla extract and about 1/2 teaspoon almond milk. If it's to thick add some more almond milk.\nAllow the cinnamon rolls to cool down a bit. Spread or pour the frosting over the cooled cinnamon rolls.", {"entities": [[13, 22, "QUANTITY"], [23, 34, "INGREDIENT"], [39, 54, "INGREDIENT"], [62, 67, "INGREDIENT"], [68, 75, "QUANTITY"], [76, 104, "INGREDIENT"], [105, 112, "QUANTITY"], [113, 128, "INGREDIENT"], [129, 139, "QUANTITY"], [140, 148, "INGREDIENT"], [158, 162, "INGREDIENT"], [185, 189, "QUANTITY"], [191, 201, "QUANTITY"], [202, 217, "INGREDIENT"], [218, 231, "QUANTITY"], [232, 240, "INGREDIENT"], [241, 253, "QUANTITY"], [254, 263, "INGREDIENT"], [264, 275, "QUANTITY"], [276, 304, "INGREDIENT"], [305, 317, "QUANTITY"], [318, 326, "INGREDIENT"], [327, 334, "QUANTITY"], [335, 349, "INGREDIENT"], [350, 362, "QUANTITY"], [363, 378, "INGREDIENT"], [383, 393, "QUANTITY"], [394, 405, "INGREDIENT"], [440, 445, "INGREDIENT"], [449, 465, "INGREDIENT"], [477, 490, "QUANTITY"], [541, 546, "INGREDIENT"], [548, 560, "QUANTITY"], [632, 637, "INGREDIENT"], [638, 642, "INGREDIENT"], [660, 665, "INGREDIENT"], [717, 720, "INGREDIENT"], [730, 739, "INGREDIENT"], [754, 757, "PROCESS"], [768, 773, "INGREDIENT"], [802, 814, "INGREDIENT"], [816, 821, "INGREDIENT"], [827, 835, "INGREDIENT"], [842, 847, "PROCESS"], [941, 944, "INGREDIENT"], [1134, 1149, "INGREDIENT"], [1190, 1198, "PROCESS"], [1204, 1216, "QUANTITY"], [1217, 1225, "INGREDIENT"], [1262, 1271, "INGREDIENT"], [1273, 1285, "QUANTITY"], [1356, 1372, "INGREDIENT"], [1379, 1387, "PROCESS"], [1393, 1398, "INGREDIENT"], [1400, 1408, "INGREDIENT"], [1453, 1461, "INGREDIENT"], [1575, 1579, "PROCESS"], [1686, 1693, "QUANTITY"], [1694, 1708, "INGREDIENT"], [1731, 1746, "INGREDIENT"], [1757, 1769, "QUANTITY"], [1770, 1781, "INGREDIENT"], [1800, 1803, "PROCESS"], [1809, 1825, "INGREDIENT"], [1837, 1845, "INGREDIENT"], [1916, 1924, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
