["Ingredients:\n1 cup ripe mango\n6 oz vegan cream cheese (I use kite hill almond plain)\n1 cup cashew milk (or use soy milk or almond milk or full fat coconut milk)\n3 to 4 tbsp sugar (depends on ripeness of the mango)\n1/2 tsp vanilla extract\na good pinch of salt\n1 tsp arrowroot starch or cornstarch\n1 tbsp refined coconut oil (optional)\n1 tbsp brown sugar\n1 tbsp almond flour\na pinch of salt\ndash of cinnamon or cardamon\n\nInstructions:\nBlend everything and add to a saucepan. Bring to a gentle boil, stirring occasionally. This will enhance the mango flavor. Cook for another 2 to 3 mins.\nLet it cool completely, then freeze in ice cream maker or popsicles or in a container.\nThe ice cream mixture can be frozen directly in a container, use cashew milk for best results. Freeze only until just about frozen. Let it sit for a few mins then scoop. For the Ice cream maker, chill completely and add to the ice cream maker to churn. When done churning, freeze for a few hours then scoop.\nMix the sprinkle ingredients in a bowl. Press and mix to make crumbles. Add a few drops of oil if needed.&nbsp;Sprinkle on the ice cream before serving. The sprinkle is optional.&nbsp;", {"entities": [[13, 18, "QUANTITY"], [19, 29, "INGREDIENT"], [30, 34, "QUANTITY"], [35, 53, "INGREDIENT"], [85, 90, "QUANTITY"], [91, 102, "INGREDIENT"], [111, 119, "INGREDIENT"], [123, 134, "INGREDIENT"], [138, 159, "INGREDIENT"], [166, 172, "QUANTITY"], [173, 178, "INGREDIENT"], [214, 221, "QUANTITY"], [222, 237, "INGREDIENT"], [245, 258, "INGREDIENT"], [259, 264, "QUANTITY"], [265, 295, "INGREDIENT"], [296, 302, "QUANTITY"], [303, 322, "INGREDIENT"], [334, 340, "QUANTITY"], [341, 352, "INGREDIENT"], [353, 359, "QUANTITY"], [360, 372, "INGREDIENT"], [375, 388, "INGREDIENT"], [394, 405, "INGREDIENT"], [454, 457, "PROCESS"], [491, 495, "PROCESS"], [497, 505, "PROCESS"], [625, 628, "INGREDIENT"], [677, 680, "INGREDIENT"], [695, 698, "INGREDIENT"], [702, 708, "INGREDIENT"], [738, 749, "INGREDIENT"], [797, 803, "INGREDIENT"], [851, 854, "INGREDIENT"], [889, 892, "PROCESS"], [900, 903, "INGREDIENT"], [989, 997, "PROCESS"], [1031, 1034, "PROCESS"], [1069, 1075, "INGREDIENT"], [1108, 1111, "INGREDIENT"], [1138, 1146, "PROCESS"]]}]
