The following day, drain the nuts and place in a food processor with the garlic, lime juice, oil, nutritional yeast, and salt.\nProcess 1-2 minutes or until the nuts turn into a paste that resembles ricotta cheese. If necessary you can add 1 tbsp. of water to reach the ricotta consistency. Taste and adjust seasoning.\nWet a large piece of cheesecloth, approximately 12 X 12. Place the paste in the center and a form it into a ball by gathering the edges of the cheesecloth around the cheese.\nTwist the top edges of the cheesecloth to tighten, give shape, and get rid of excess water in the cheese.

Place the onion and garlic in the pan and let the high heat char them for 2 minutes on each side. Remove from pan, peel the garlic, and place them both in the blender.\nRemove the tomato from the water and add to the blender.
