["Ingredients:\n1 cup packed chopped spinach  (or other tender greens)\n1 cup whole-wheat flour\n1/4 cup unbleached white flour  (or all-purpose flour)\n1/3 teaspoon salt\n1/4 teaspoon carom (ajwain seeds or coarsely ground cumin seeds)\n1/2 teaspoon safflower or coconut oil\n2 Tablespoon warm water\n1/2 cup whole-wheat flour (for dusting)\nSafflower or melted vegan butter (for cooking)\n\nInstructions:\nBring 3 cups of water to a rapid boil in a deep pot. Blanch the spinach for 3 to 4 minutes. Drain well, blend with 1/2 cup water and keep aside.\nIn a large bowl, combine the flours, salt and carom seeds. Add 1/2 teaspoon oil and the spinach puree and mix well. Add more water and knead into a slightly sticky soft dough. Do not knead for more than a minute. The dough will be sticky and soft.\nSpray or brush oil on the dough, cover with a kitchen towel and let the dough sit for 15 minutes.\nOil hands and knead for a minute. Add tablespoon of flour if needed. Divide dough into equal parts and shape into balls. Keep the balls covered by the kitchen towel.\nFlatten a ball and dust completely with flour. Roll the ball into a flat round. Brush the paratha with oil or melted vegan butter. Fold the rolled dough into a square or laccha style. Roll it out and proceed to cook. You can also stuff this paratha with potatoes, cauliflower or radish.\nHeat a thick bottom skillet at medium high heat. When the skillet is hot, place the rolled out dough in the skillet. Cook the flatbread for 45 seconds to a minute per side.\nFlip and cook the other side. Brush oil on the paratha and flip and cook for 30 seconds.\nBrush oil on the current side as well and flip and cook for 30 seconds or until nicely browned. Serve hot. Keep lightly covered with a towel until ready to serve. Store in paper towel lined container. Do not overcook the flatbreads. Cooking time depends on the thickness of the flatbread, so adjust accordingly.\nVariation: Add a 1/2 teaspoon garam masala to the flours", {"entities": [[13, 18, "QUANTITY"], [19, 41, "INGREDIENT"], [68, 73, "QUANTITY"], [74, 91, "INGREDIENT"], [92, 99, "QUANTITY"], [100, 122, "INGREDIENT"], [128, 145, "INGREDIENT"], [147, 159, "QUANTITY"], [160, 164, "INGREDIENT"], [165, 177, "QUANTITY"], [178, 183, "INGREDIENT"], [185, 191, "INGREDIENT"], [192, 197, "INGREDIENT"], [210, 222, "INGREDIENT"], [223, 228, "INGREDIENT"], [230, 242, "QUANTITY"], [243, 267, "INGREDIENT"], [268, 280, "QUANTITY"], [281, 291, "INGREDIENT"], [292, 299, "QUANTITY"], [300, 317, "INGREDIENT"], [345, 364, "INGREDIENT"], [370, 377, "PROCESS"], [400, 406, "QUANTITY"], [407, 415, "INGREDIENT"], [427, 431, "PROCESS"], [458, 465, "INGREDIENT"], [509, 516, "QUANTITY"], [517, 522, "INGREDIENT"], [576, 580, "INGREDIENT"], [585, 596, "INGREDIENT"], [602, 614, "QUANTITY"], [615, 618, "INGREDIENT"], [627, 634, "INGREDIENT"], [635, 640, "INGREDIENT"], [645, 648, "PROCESS"], [664, 669, "INGREDIENT"], [674, 679, "PROCESS"], [722, 727, "PROCESS"], [802, 805, "INGREDIENT"], [885, 888, "INGREDIENT"], [899, 904, "PROCESS"], [934, 942, "INGREDIENT"], [1091, 1096, "INGREDIENT"], [1154, 1180, "INGREDIENT"], [1262, 1266, "PROCESS"], [1272, 1275, "INGREDIENT"], [1305, 1313, "INGREDIENT"], [1315, 1326, "INGREDIENT"], [1412, 1417, "PROCESS"], [1520, 1524, "PROCESS"], [1547, 1550, "INGREDIENT"], [1579, 1583, "PROCESS"], [1606, 1609, "INGREDIENT"], [1651, 1655, "PROCESS"], [1929, 1941, "QUANTITY"], [1942, 1954, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
