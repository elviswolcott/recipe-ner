["Ingredients:\n1 cup strawberries, sliced in quarters\n2  kiwi, cut into slices\n2  oranges, cut into slices\n1  mango, cut into stripes (alternatively you can use a star-shaped cutter)\n2  peaches, cut into stripes\n1/2 cup cherries, pitted and cut into halves\n1/2 cup blueberries\n1/2 cup raspberries\n1  star fruit\n8 sheets of Vietnamese rice paper\nfresh mint leaves\n2 cups strawberries\n1   passion fruit\n1 cup dark chocolate, melted\n\nInstructions:\nCut all fruits in small pieces. If you want you can use a star-shaped cutter for the mango.\nWhen you're done cutting the fruits, fill a shallow bowl with water and dip the rice papers in water so they get moderately wet on both sides. Don't let them soak too long, so they don't get too soft.\nWhen you soaked the rice papers, fill them with the fruits and wrap them like a burrito. I think it's best to center the filling and then roll it up and fold in the two side flaps.\nThen make the strawberry dipping sauce: Put the strawberries and the passion fruit in a blender and process until smooth. Alternatively you can serve them with melted dark chocolate.\nServe the fruit spring rolls with the strawberry dipping sauce or the chocolate sauce. Or both. ;-)", {"entities": [[13, 18, "QUANTITY"], [19, 51, "INGREDIENT"], [151, 154, "INGREDIENT"], [210, 217, "QUANTITY"], [218, 254, "INGREDIENT"], [255, 262, "QUANTITY"], [263, 274, "INGREDIENT"], [275, 282, "QUANTITY"], [283, 294, "INGREDIENT"], [332, 336, "INGREDIENT"], [343, 360, "INGREDIENT"], [361, 367, "QUANTITY"], [368, 380, "INGREDIENT"], [399, 404, "QUANTITY"], [405, 427, "INGREDIENT"], [491, 494, "INGREDIENT"], [597, 602, "INGREDIENT"], [615, 619, "INGREDIENT"], [630, 635, "INGREDIENT"], [745, 751, "INGREDIENT"], [756, 760, "INGREDIENT"], [799, 803, "PROCESS"], [965, 977, "INGREDIENT"], [1057, 1060, "INGREDIENT"], [1084, 1098, "INGREDIENT"], [1170, 1179, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
