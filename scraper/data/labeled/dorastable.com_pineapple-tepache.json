["Ingredients:\n1  Large ripe pineapple\n1   Ceylon cinnamon stick ((5- inch))\n3-6  Small piloncillo cones* ((total weight 4.5 oz or 1/2 a large cone))\n2 L Purified water\n3 - 4   whole cloves, 2-3 allspice berries or 1 star anise ((optional))\n\nInstructions:\nA reminder before starting: Since we are dealing with bacteria and wild yeast(s), it is crucial that we keep everything as clean and as sterile as possible to avoid any cross-contamination with unwanted or bad bacteria. When it comes to fermentation, you always want to treat it as if you were preparing a bottle for a baby.\nGently rinse the pineapple using a soft-bristled brush under running warm water.\nTwist off the pineapple top and discard. Cut off and reserve both ends of the pineapple, cut the pineapple crosswise, and then cut the rind into medium-sized squares. In this recipe we aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to be using the actual fruit, so you can eat it or save it for something else. This is optional, but you can also remove and use the pineapple core.\nPlace the pineapple ends, rind and optional core along with the rest of the ingredients into a large 3-4 liter glass jar and fill with the water.\nGive this a good stir, cover loosely with a lid or cheesecloth, and let it sit at room temperature away from direct sunlight. Let this ferment anywhere from 2-4 days depending on your taste; the longer it sits, the stronger the flavor. There will be bubbles and a layer of foam that forms on top of the tepache; this is completely normal and is encouraged as this is a sign of proper fermentation. Stir and taste every 12-24 hours. I usually let mine sit out for 4 days.\nOnce the tepache has reached your desired taste level, strain into a large glass pitcher and serve immediately with ice. To store, pour into a glass bottle that has a bottle cap, refrigerate, and consume within 2 days.", {"entities": [[27, 36, "INGREDIENT"], [48, 56, "INGREDIENT"], [106, 111, "INGREDIENT"], [126, 145, "INGREDIENT"], [161, 166, "INGREDIENT"], [181, 187, "INGREDIENT"], [193, 201, "INGREDIENT"], [596, 605, "INGREDIENT"], [648, 658, "INGREDIENT"], [674, 683, "INGREDIENT"], [738, 747, "INGREDIENT"], [757, 766, "INGREDIENT"], [897, 900, "INGREDIENT"], [965, 968, "INGREDIENT"], [993, 1002, "INGREDIENT"], [1019, 1028, "INGREDIENT"], [1148, 1153, "INGREDIENT"], [1172, 1176, "PROCESS"], [1742, 1745, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
