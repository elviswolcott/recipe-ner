["Ingredients:\n2 medium eggplants\n3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n2  cloves of garlic\n3/4 teaspoon salt\n1/4 cup tahini\n3 tablespoons lemon juice\n2 tablespoons chopped parsley\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 350 F.\nWith a sharp knife, cut the eggplant into half lengthwise. Line a baking tray with parchment paper and place the eggplant halves on top with the flesh-side facing up.\nBrush with olive oil (I used about one tablespoon in total).\nBake them for 40 minutes. Cover them with aluminium foil for the last 10-15 minutes, so they don't become too brown.\nLet the eggplants cool down for about 10 minutes, so they are easier to handle. In the meanwhile place the remaining ingredients into a food processor.\nScrape out the flesh of the eggplant with a spoon and add it to the tahini mixture. Process until smooth.\nSprinkle with freshly chopped parsley, some more olive oil, and red pepper flakes. Serve with warm pita bread. Enjoy!", {"entities": [[32, 45, "QUANTITY"], [46, 68, "INGREDIENT"], [72, 78, "INGREDIENT"], [82, 88, "INGREDIENT"], [89, 101, "QUANTITY"], [102, 106, "INGREDIENT"], [107, 114, "QUANTITY"], [115, 121, "INGREDIENT"], [122, 135, "QUANTITY"], [136, 147, "INGREDIENT"], [148, 161, "QUANTITY"], [162, 177, "INGREDIENT"], [286, 292, "PROCESS"], [323, 328, "PROCESS"], [398, 407, "INGREDIENT"], [440, 445, "INGREDIENT"], [662, 667, "PROCESS"], [771, 774, "PROCESS"], [785, 791, "INGREDIENT"], [837, 860, "INGREDIENT"], [872, 881, "INGREDIENT"], [887, 904, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
