["Ingredients:\n210 grams (1 cup) vegan kimchi, chopped (homemade recipe HERE)\n2 tablespoons kimchi juice\n70 grams (1/2 cup) Korean wheat pancake mix (substitute: all-purpose flour)\n60 grams (1/4 cup) ice-cold water\n1 tablespoon gochugaru, or Korean chili flakes\n1  scallion, segmented\n1.5 tablespoon soy sauce\n1 tablespoon rice vinegar\n1/2 teaspoon sugar\n1/2 teaspoon toasted sesame oil\n1 clove garlic, finely minced\n1 pinch gochugaru, or Korean chili flakes\nscallions, finely chopped\ntoasted sesame seeds\n\nInstructions:\nMake Dipping Sauce. Mix all dipping sauce ingredients together and taste to adjust. Set aside. You can also store this in the refrigerator for future use. Note: the dipping sauce is made first to allow time for flavors to infuse & deepen.\nMake the Batter. In a large mixing bowl, combine chopped kimchi, Korean wheat pancake mix (or all purpose flour), ice-cold water, gochugaru, and scallions. Mix until a smooth batter forms. You can add a little extra kimchi juice or water if the batter is too thick. Note: do not over-mix the batter, so as to minimize gluten development.\nMake the Pancakes. Heat up a generous amount of oil non-stick or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. (oil should cover the whole surface of the pan). Since this recipe makes two pancakes, start by pouring half of the batter in. Note: how many pancakes you make depends on the size of your pan. Spread the batter out evenly to a thin, round shape and fry until the edges begin to look golden-brown, about 3-4 minutes. Right before you flip the pancake, add about 1 tablespoon more oil. Carefully flip the pancake and cook until the other side becomes crispy golden-brown. Note: you can turn the heat up slightly towards the end of cooking to get the pancake even crispier. Once cooked, remove the pancake from the pan and repeat until no more batter is left. Slice diagonally into 6-8 pieces. Serve warm with the dipping sauce.", {"entities": [[13, 22, "QUANTITY"], [24, 29, "QUANTITY"], [31, 43, "INGREDIENT"], [45, 52, "INGREDIENT"], [76, 89, "QUANTITY"], [90, 102, "INGREDIENT"], [103, 111, "QUANTITY"], [113, 120, "QUANTITY"], [135, 146, "INGREDIENT"], [160, 177, "INGREDIENT"], [179, 187, "QUANTITY"], [189, 196, "QUANTITY"], [198, 201, "INGREDIENT"], [202, 212, "INGREDIENT"], [213, 225, "QUANTITY"], [226, 259, "INGREDIENT"], [298, 307, "INGREDIENT"], [308, 320, "QUANTITY"], [321, 333, "INGREDIENT"], [334, 346, "QUANTITY"], [347, 352, "INGREDIENT"], [353, 365, "QUANTITY"], [366, 384, "INGREDIENT"], [393, 399, "INGREDIENT"], [408, 414, "INGREDIENT"], [423, 456, "INGREDIENT"], [457, 466, "INGREDIENT"], [475, 482, "INGREDIENT"], [483, 503, "INGREDIENT"], [618, 621, "INGREDIENT"], [786, 792, "PROCESS"], [807, 814, "INGREDIENT"], [836, 847, "INGREDIENT"], [852, 869, "INGREDIENT"], [872, 875, "INGREDIENT"], [876, 886, "INGREDIENT"], [888, 897, "INGREDIENT"], [903, 912, "INGREDIENT"], [951, 954, "INGREDIENT"], [955, 958, "PROCESS"], [974, 986, "INGREDIENT"], [990, 995, "INGREDIENT"], [1042, 1045, "PROCESS"], [1141, 1147, "INGREDIENT"], [1203, 1206, "INGREDIENT"], [1429, 1433, "PROCESS"], [1451, 1454, "PROCESS"], [1553, 1556, "PROCESS"], [1563, 1575, "QUANTITY"], [1581, 1584, "INGREDIENT"], [1617, 1621, "PROCESS"], [1682, 1685, "INGREDIENT"], [1731, 1738, "PROCESS"], [1778, 1784, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
