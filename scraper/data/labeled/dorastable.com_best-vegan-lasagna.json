["Ingredients:\n1 cup Cashews (soaked overnight in hot water)\n7 oz. Extra firm tofu (pressed (1/2 block))\n2 cloves Garlic (peeled)\n1 tbsp. Nutritional yeast\n2 tbsp. Lemon Juice (fresh)\n1/2 tsp. Chopped thyme\n1 tbsp. Chopped chives\n1 tbsp Chopped basil\n cup Almonds raw\n1 clove Garlic\n cup Water\n cup Almond milk (unsweetened)\n1 tbsp. Lemon juice fresh\n1 jar (23.5 oz.) Spicy Arrabbiata Marinara Sauce\n1 tbsp. Primal Kitchen extra virgin olive oil\n1/2  Red onion (minced)\n1  Zucchini (diced)\n1  Yellow squash (diced)\n1  Red bell pepper (diced)\n1  cups Vegetable stock\n cup Chopped basil\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat oven to 400F.\nTo make the cashew cheese: Drain your cashews and place in the food processor and process for 3-5 minutes until the cashews become like a paste, scrape down the sides of the food processor.\nAdd the tofu, garlic, nutritional yeast, lemon juice, and process until you have a smooth paste. Add salt and pepper to taste, and the herbs then process one more time to incorporate. Set aside.\nTo make the almond crema: Place all the ingredients in the blender and process until smooth. (If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a high powered blender I recommend you soak and peel the almonds beforehand). Set aside.\nTo make the lasagna: Heat a large pot to medium heat and add olive oil. Add onion and cook for 3- 4 minutes until it is translucent, add bell pepper and cook for 3 more minutes until it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tender. Add zucchini and yellow squash and continue to cook until the squash is firm but completely cooked, about 4 minutes.\nAdd jar of sauce, and vegetable broth. Simmer slowly for 6 minutes then blend until smooth (I use a hand blender for this).\nPour a layer of sauce into a 9 X 13 baking dish add three sheets of lasagna. Top with 5 tbsp. of cashew ricotta and pour 2 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 3 tbsp. of almond crema. Repeat until you have used all the cashew ricotta, and sauce. Reserve 1/4 cup of almond crema.\nCover with foil and bake for 45 min. Remove from oven and let sit for 8 minutes. Pour the remaining almond sauce on top and swirl with a spoon to evenly distribute it. Sprinkle with chopped basil and serve.", {"entities": [[13, 18, "QUANTITY"], [19, 26, "INGREDIENT"], [28, 34, "INGREDIENT"], [48, 57, "INGREDIENT"], [59, 63, "QUANTITY"], [65, 80, "INGREDIENT"], [82, 89, "PROCESS"], [105, 111, "INGREDIENT"], [128, 134, "QUANTITY"], [136, 153, "INGREDIENT"], [154, 160, "QUANTITY"], [162, 173, "INGREDIENT"], [175, 180, "INGREDIENT"], [182, 189, "QUANTITY"], [199, 204, "INGREDIENT"], [205, 211, "QUANTITY"], [221, 227, "INGREDIENT"], [228, 234, "QUANTITY"], [235, 248, "INGREDIENT"], [250, 253, "QUANTITY"], [254, 261, "INGREDIENT"], [282, 285, "QUANTITY"], [286, 291, "INGREDIENT"], [293, 296, "QUANTITY"], [297, 308, "INGREDIENT"], [323, 329, "QUANTITY"], [331, 342, "INGREDIENT"], [343, 348, "INGREDIENT"], [398, 404, "QUANTITY"], [421, 443, "INGREDIENT"], [453, 458, "INGREDIENT"], [460, 466, "INGREDIENT"], [481, 486, "INGREDIENT"], [506, 511, "INGREDIENT"], [520, 531, "INGREDIENT"], [533, 538, "INGREDIENT"], [540, 547, "QUANTITY"], [548, 563, "INGREDIENT"], [565, 568, "QUANTITY"], [569, 582, "INGREDIENT"], [658, 665, "INGREDIENT"], [670, 675, "PROCESS"], [736, 743, "INGREDIENT"], [758, 763, "INGREDIENT"], [818, 822, "INGREDIENT"], [824, 830, "INGREDIENT"], [832, 849, "INGREDIENT"], [851, 862, "INGREDIENT"], [900, 905, "INGREDIENT"], [911, 915, "INGREDIENT"], [920, 926, "INGREDIENT"], [945, 950, "INGREDIENT"], [1017, 1029, "INGREDIENT"], [1176, 1183, "INGREDIENT"], [1265, 1268, "PROCESS"], [1269, 1278, "INGREDIENT"], [1284, 1289, "INGREDIENT"], [1294, 1298, "PROCESS"], [1341, 1344, "PROCESS"], [1345, 1356, "INGREDIENT"], [1361, 1365, "PROCESS"], [1453, 1457, "PROCESS"], [1498, 1504, "INGREDIENT"], [1545, 1560, "INGREDIENT"], [1683, 1689, "PROCESS"], [1695, 1698, "PROCESS"], [1733, 1739, "QUANTITY"], [1774, 1780, "QUANTITY"], [1785, 1797, "INGREDIENT"], [1869, 1876, "QUANTITY"], [1880, 1892, "INGREDIENT"], [1914, 1918, "PROCESS"], [2076, 2089, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
