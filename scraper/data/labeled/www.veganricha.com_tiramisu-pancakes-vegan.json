Add the rest pancake ingredients. Add more water if needed to get a thick pancake batter. dont over mix. Too thin and watery batter also will not rise well. Let batter sit(for 2 minutes) till you prepare the cashew mascarpone.\nBlend the cashews with water and vinegar till creamy. Add sugar or maple and blend again. Taste for tang and sweetness, adjust and keep. you can make thicker or thinner or more cream as needed.\nCook the pancakes on well heated and greased thick bottom pan. 5-7 minutes per side depending on size. Since the multigrain batter is a bit thick, you might have to spread it with a spatula into shape.\nMix some liqueur in the maple syrup for drizzling if serving with liqueur, or keep separate.\nTo assemble, brush pancake with maple syrup or maple liqueur mix .(Or use rum extract mixed with maple). Top with cashew mascarpone, place another pancake and repeat.\nDust some cocoa powder or Chocolate shavings on top. you can also saturate the bottom pancake with a bit more liqueur or maple + coffee per taste.
