Soften the cashews by soaking them in either: 1) boiling water for 30 minutes. 2) room temperature for at least 4 hours.\nMake the White Chocolate Cups. In a pot, melt the white chocolate chips in a heat-safe bowl over simmering water (like a floating boat). In a silicone cupcake mould, pour in about 1 tablespoon of the melted chocolate, swirling around to coat completely. Be sure to swirl the chocolate several times, especially along the sides otherwise they will be too thin. Chill in the freezer until set.\nMake the Base. In a food processor, blend together raw almonds, rolled oats, melted coconut oil, and pitted medjool dates. Once the chocolate cups have set, spoon the mixture into each cup and press tightly. Chill in the freezer while preparing the filling.\nMake the Filling. Combine all filling ingredients in a food processor and process until smooth and creamy. Taste the filling and adjust sweetness with maple syrup, if desired. Carefully pour the filling into each mould, filling them to the brim. Chill in the freezer until solidified.", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 32, "INGREDIENT"], [33, 40, "QUANTITY"], [41, 64, "INGREDIENT"], [65, 78, "QUANTITY"], [79, 98, "INGREDIENT"], [110, 115, "INGREDIENT"], [133, 152, "INGREDIENT"], [162, 170, "INGREDIENT"], [181, 195, "INGREDIENT"], [197, 204, "QUANTITY"], [205, 216, "INGREDIENT"], [217, 230, "QUANTITY"], [231, 242, "INGREDIENT"], [243, 256, "QUANTITY"], [257, 269, "INGREDIENT"], [270, 283, "QUANTITY"], [284, 310, "INGREDIENT"], [311, 320, "QUANTITY"], [321, 355, "INGREDIENT"], [380, 387, "INGREDIENT"], [400, 407, "INGREDIENT"], [438, 451, "INGREDIENT"], [525, 534, "INGREDIENT"], [566, 581, "INGREDIENT"], [617, 622, "INGREDIENT"], [690, 702, "QUANTITY"], [717, 726, "INGREDIENT"], [785, 794, "INGREDIENT"], [864, 868, "PROCESS"], [953, 964, "INGREDIENT"], [966, 977, "INGREDIENT"], [979, 997, "INGREDIENT"], [1018, 1023, "INGREDIENT"], [1034, 1043, "INGREDIENT"], [1082, 1086, "INGREDIENT"], [1087, 1090, "QUANTITY"], [1095, 1100, "PROCESS"], [1311, 1322, "INGREDIENT"], [1368, 1372, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
