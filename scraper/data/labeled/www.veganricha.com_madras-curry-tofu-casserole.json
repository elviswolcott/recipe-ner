Grind only one red chili if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re\u00c2\u00a0not sure about the heat and you can use the other chilies whole in the dish. Grind up in the spice grinder\u00c2\u00a0and set aside.\nIn a casserole\u00c2\u00a0dish, add tofu and toss it with a teaspoon of oil. bake at\u00c2\u00a0400 degrees f(205 c) \u00c2\u00a0for 10 minutes. Remove the dish and move the tofu to one side so\u00c2\u00a0there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enough space for the onions.\nAdd in the\u00c2\u00a0onions, 2 teaspoons of oil, garlic, curry leaves.

Otherwise bake\u00c2\u00a0for another 10 minutes or so.\nRemove the dish\u00c2\u00a0from the oven and carefully taste. Adjust salt and \u00c2\u00a0flavor.\nServe with rice, dosas or rotis.
