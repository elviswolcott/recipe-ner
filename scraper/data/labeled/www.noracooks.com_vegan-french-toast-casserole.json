["Ingredients:\n1  day old large loaf (14-16 ounces) french or sourdough bread* (cut into 1 inch cubes (about 10 cups))\n12 ounces silken tofu\n(1) 13.5-ounce can full fat coconut milk\n2 tablespoons cornstarch\n1/2 cup granulated sugar\n1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract\n1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n1/2 cup brown sugar\n1/4 cup all purpose flour\n1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n3 tablespoons vegan butter, cold\n\nInstructions:\nPrepare the bread: Cut the bread into 1 inch cubes. I do this by first slicing the loaf, then cutting into smaller cubes. Lightly grease a 9 by 13 inch casserole dish, and add the bread cubes to it.\nMake the custard: In a blender, add the silken tofu (drained of water if needed), coconut milk, cornstarch, sugar, vanilla, cinnamon and salt. Blend until smooth.\nPour the custard over the bread cubes. Using your hands, press the bread down into the custard a few times, until the bread is soaked in it. Cover and place in the refrigerator for 8-12 hours. You can bake it immediately if you prefer.\nIn the morning, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.\nMake the topping: In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, flour and cinnamon. Then cut the vegan butter in with a fork or your fingers. Sprinkle this over the top of the casserole.\nBake, uncovered, for 40-50 minutes, until golden brown on top and cooked throughout.\nSprinkle with a dusting of powdered sugar and serve with warm, pure maple syrup.
