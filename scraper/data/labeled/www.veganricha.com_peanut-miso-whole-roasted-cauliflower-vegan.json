Then use your knife or a skewer to poke some holes on top of the cauliflower as well as base/stem side of your cauliflower.\nSlice up your mushrooms and carrots.\nFind a dish that fits the cauliflower but only has 1-2 inches space around the cauliflower.\nGrease the dish and set it aside. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit(200c ). Place the cauliflower in the dish and bake for 10-12 minutes.\nMeanwhile, prepare the marinade: Add all the ingredients to a blender and blend until smooth.\nRemove the cauliflower from the oven then let it cool for 3 minutes so that you can handle it carefully. Flip the cauliflower and pour some of the marinade through the stem area so that it coats the inside of the florets.\nThen flip it and brush some marinade all over the cauliflower really well. Place the cauliflower in the baking dish again and put it in the oven to bake.\nRemove after another 15 minutes. Reduce the baking temperature to 375 degrees F(190 c)\nAdd in the carrots and mushrooms around the cauliflower. Drizzle some of the marinade all over.

Add 3 tablespoons of water in the blender to rinse out the blender and pour that on the side of the cauliflower over the mushrooms and carrots.\nPlace the dish in the oven and cover it lightly with a foil and continue to bake for another 20 minutes.\nCheck if your cauliflower is done to preference.
