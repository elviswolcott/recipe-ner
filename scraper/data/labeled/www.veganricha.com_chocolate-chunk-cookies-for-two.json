Mix well until well combined and you don't see big drops of oil floating around.\nAdd 2.5 tbsp flour and sprinkle baking soda on the flour and mix well.

The mixture should be thick batter, or stiff batter.\nFold in the chocolate chunks. Drop mixture on parchment lined baking sheet and flatten slightly. Sprinkle salt on the cookie and press in.\nBake at 350 deg F / 180c for 11 to 13 minutes till the edges just about start to turn golden. Tap the baking sheet and let it cool.
