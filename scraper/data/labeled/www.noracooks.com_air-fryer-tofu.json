["Ingredients:\n14- ounce block extra-firm tofu\n2 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce\n1 tablespoon rice vinegar\n1 teaspoon sesame oil\n\nInstructions:\nQuick press the tofu:\u00c2\u00a0Cut the tofu into cubes. Place them evenly on a flat surface such as a cutting board lined with paper towels or a clean towel. Cover with a layer of paper towels, set a baking sheet on top and then something heavy, like a large book or cast iron skillet. Press like this for 15 minutes. Or use a tofu press.\nIn a small bowl, stir together the soy sauce, rice vinegar and sesame oil.\nAdd the pressed tofu cubes to a bowl and drizzle the marinade over them. Toss gently to coat the pieces. Let the tofu marinate for about 15 minutes, longer if desired (up to 8 hours in the refrigerator.)\nPlace the tofu cubes in the air fryer, in a single layer, so the pieces don&#x27;t touch. Depending on the size of your air fryer, you may need to cook half the tofu at a time. Cook at 400 degrees F for 10-15 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally after 10 minutes. Cook until the tofu is golden and crispy, but not burned.", {"entities": [[23, 44, "INGREDIENT"], [45, 58, "QUANTITY"], [59, 79, "INGREDIENT"], [80, 92, "QUANTITY"], [93, 105, "INGREDIENT"], [106, 116, "QUANTITY"], [117, 127, "INGREDIENT"], [149, 154, "PROCESS"], [159, 163, "INGREDIENT"], [174, 178, "INGREDIENT"], [335, 341, "PROCESS"], [462, 466, "INGREDIENT"], [467, 472, "PROCESS"], [491, 495, "PROCESS"], [509, 519, "INGREDIENT"], [520, 532, "INGREDIENT"], [537, 547, "INGREDIENT"], [557, 564, "PROCESS"], [565, 569, "INGREDIENT"], [662, 666, "INGREDIENT"], [763, 767, "INGREDIENT"], [900, 904, "PROCESS"], [914, 918, "INGREDIENT"], [1033, 1037, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
