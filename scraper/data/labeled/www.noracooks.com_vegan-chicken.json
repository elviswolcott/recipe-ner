["Ingredients:\n1 1/2 cups vital wheat gluten\n1/3 cup all purpose flour\n2 tablespoons nutritional yeast\n1 teaspoon onion powder\n1 teaspoon garlic powder\n1/2 teaspoon paprika\n1 teaspoon salt\n1 1/2 cups vegan chikn flavored broth or vegetable broth*\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n\nInstructions:\nIn a large bowl, combine the vital wheat gluten, flour, nutritional yeast, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika and salt. Stir to combine.\nTo the bowl with the dry ingredients, pour in the broth and oil. Stir well until the mixture starts to pull away from the bowl.\nTransfer to a lightly floured surface, and knead with your hands for just a minute until it comes together, not too much. It will still be quite messy, not a smooth dough.\nBreak into 6 pieces and press gently into circles, or &quot;chicken&quot; shapes. They can all be different and they don&#039;t have to be perfect, just try to make them similar sizes so they cook evenly.\nWrap each piece in foil. Place all 6 pieces in a steamer basket with water on the bottom and steam for 30 minutes.\nRemove carefully from the foil. Now you can either pan fry them in a little vegan butter or oil, grill them, or slice and use anywhere you would like. Enjoy!", {"entities": [[13, 23, "QUANTITY"], [24, 42, "INGREDIENT"], [43, 50, "QUANTITY"], [51, 68, "INGREDIENT"], [69, 82, "QUANTITY"], [83, 100, "INGREDIENT"], [101, 111, "QUANTITY"], [112, 124, "INGREDIENT"], [125, 135, "QUANTITY"], [136, 149, "INGREDIENT"], [150, 162, "QUANTITY"], [163, 170, "INGREDIENT"], [171, 181, "QUANTITY"], [182, 186, "INGREDIENT"], [187, 197, "QUANTITY"], [198, 244, "INGREDIENT"], [245, 258, "QUANTITY"], [259, 268, "INGREDIENT"], [313, 331, "INGREDIENT"], [333, 338, "INGREDIENT"], [340, 357, "INGREDIENT"], [359, 371, "INGREDIENT"], [373, 386, "INGREDIENT"], [388, 395, "INGREDIENT"], [400, 405, "INGREDIENT"], [473, 478, "INGREDIENT"], [483, 486, "INGREDIENT"], [594, 599, "PROCESS"], [747, 752, "PROCESS"], [810, 813, "INGREDIENT"], [915, 919, "PROCESS"], [933, 937, "INGREDIENT"], [997, 1002, "INGREDIENT"], [1021, 1026, "PROCESS"], [1083, 1086, "INGREDIENT"], [1098, 1101, "PROCESS"], [1119, 1138, "INGREDIENT"], [1140, 1145, "PROCESS"]]}]
