["Ingredients:\n1 cup warm water\n1.5 cups whole wheat flour (I use Bob's Red Mill)\n1.25 cups bread flour\n1 teaspoon vital wheat gluten (optional- for chewier bagels)\n1 Tablespoon agave syrup (or malt syrup)\n3/4 teaspoon salt\n1 teaspoon raw sugar\n1.5 teaspoons active yeast (Red Star)\n1 Tablespoons extra virgin olive oil or virgin coconut oil\nFor onion bagels- add a Tablespoon of onion flakes.\n4-5 cups water\n1 Tablespoons agave or malt syrup\n1 teaspoon salt\nOnion flakes\nPoppy seeds\nsesame seeds\nsunflower seeds\nwatermelon seeds\n\nInstructions:\nIn a large bowl, add 1/4 cup\u00c2\u00a0warm water, 1 teaspoon raw sugar and yeast. Mix and let sit until frothy(10 minutes).\nAdd salt to the 1.5 cups wheat flour and mix. Add wheat flour, 1 cup bread flour, wheat gluten if using, to the yeast mix.\nAdd onion flakes for onion bagels.\nAdd agave, oil, rest of the water and knead 5-6 minutes in stand mixer or 8-9 minutes by hand.\nIf the dough is very sticky, then add a little bread flour until the the dough is soft and smooth.(more of the stiff side).\nPlace dough in well greased container. Cover with towel and let sit for 1.5 hours or until doubled.\nPunch dough down, use a Tablespoon or so bread flour to help make the dough less sticky. (You can refrigerate the dough at this point overnight for chewier bagels. Next day, let the dough sit out for an hour before continuing).\nDivide into 6 equal parts.\nStart up the water bath to boil over high heat. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.\nShape each part into a bagel. Make a long rope by rolling between your palms and then sticking the ends together with atleast a 3 finger hole in between. or make a ball, poke a large hole using wet fingers or fat round spatula handle.(the bagels expand while boiling, hence reducing the hole, so keep the hole larger or you will get an almost bun like, small hole, pictured onion bagel .\nAdd agave and salt to the boiling water, mix. Add bagels 2 or 3 at a time and let boil for 30 seconds on each side.\nTake them out and place on a towel.\nYou can directly bake these for plain bagels on a baking sheet.\nOptional step: For a shiny gloss, mix a Tablespoon cornstarch in 2 Tablespoons water. Mix well. add a 1/4 cup boiling water and mix until thick. Brush this on the top.\nSprinkle your toppings on the bagels. Press down a bit to stick. or dip the bagel upside down in the bowl of seeds.\nPlace bagels on parchment lined baking sheet and bake for 17-20 minutes.(25 minutes for larger sized bagels).\nLet cool before slicing or storing.\nTop with vegan butter, vegan cream cheeze, herbed oil, marmalade, nut butters or use to make your fave loaded burgers!", {"entities": [[15, 29, "INGREDIENT"], [39, 56, "INGREDIENT"], [85, 101, "INGREDIENT"], [102, 112, "QUANTITY"], [113, 131, "INGREDIENT"], [163, 175, "QUANTITY"], [176, 187, "INGREDIENT"], [204, 216, "QUANTITY"], [217, 221, "INGREDIENT"], [222, 232, "QUANTITY"], [233, 242, "INGREDIENT"], [257, 269, "INGREDIENT"], [281, 294, "QUANTITY"], [295, 339, "INGREDIENT"], [344, 349, "INGREDIENT"], [358, 361, "PROCESS"], [375, 383, "INGREDIENT"], [394, 400, "QUANTITY"], [401, 406, "INGREDIENT"], [407, 420, "QUANTITY"], [421, 440, "INGREDIENT"], [441, 451, "QUANTITY"], [452, 456, "INGREDIENT"], [457, 462, "INGREDIENT"], [470, 481, "INGREDIENT"], [482, 494, "INGREDIENT"], [495, 510, "INGREDIENT"], [522, 527, "INGREDIENT"], [560, 563, "PROCESS"], [573, 583, "INGREDIENT"], [585, 595, "QUANTITY"], [596, 605, "INGREDIENT"], [610, 615, "INGREDIENT"], [663, 667, "INGREDIENT"], [684, 695, "INGREDIENT"], [700, 703, "PROCESS"], [709, 720, "INGREDIENT"], [722, 727, "QUANTITY"], [728, 739, "INGREDIENT"], [741, 753, "INGREDIENT"], [771, 776, "INGREDIENT"], [777, 780, "PROCESS"], [786, 798, "INGREDIENT"], [803, 808, "INGREDIENT"], [821, 826, "INGREDIENT"], [828, 831, "INGREDIENT"], [845, 850, "INGREDIENT"], [855, 860, "PROCESS"], [946, 949, "PROCESS"], [959, 970, "INGREDIENT"], [1171, 1176, "INGREDIENT"], [1177, 1188, "INGREDIENT"], [1230, 1233, "INGREDIENT"], [1404, 1409, "INGREDIENT"], [1418, 1422, "PROCESS"], [1480, 1484, "INGREDIENT"], [1733, 1740, "PROCESS"], [1848, 1853, "INGREDIENT"], [1866, 1871, "INGREDIENT"], [1876, 1880, "INGREDIENT"], [1888, 1901, "INGREDIENT"], [1903, 1906, "PROCESS"], [1944, 1948, "PROCESS"], [1967, 1971, "INGREDIENT"], [1996, 2001, "PROCESS"], [2018, 2021, "INGREDIENT"], [2031, 2035, "PROCESS"], [2064, 2070, "PROCESS"], [2112, 2115, "PROCESS"], [2129, 2139, "INGREDIENT"], [2143, 2156, "QUANTITY"], [2157, 2162, "INGREDIENT"], [2174, 2177, "PROCESS"], [2180, 2187, "QUANTITY"], [2188, 2201, "INGREDIENT"], [2206, 2209, "PROCESS"], [2355, 2360, "INGREDIENT"], [2394, 2400, "PROCESS"], [2411, 2415, "PROCESS"], [2517, 2529, "INGREDIENT"], [2558, 2561, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
