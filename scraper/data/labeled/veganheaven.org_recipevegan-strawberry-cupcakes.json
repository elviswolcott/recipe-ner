["Ingredients:\n1/3 cup vegan butter, softened\n1/2 cup brown sugar\n1 pinch salt\n1/2 cup almond or soy milk\n1 teaspoon apple vinegar\n1 3/4 cups regular flour\n3 tablespoons unsweetened apple sauce\n2 teaspoons baking powder\n1/2 cup fresh blueberries, blended until smooth\n1/2 cup fresh strawberries, blended until smooth\n1/2 cup vegan butter\n1 1/2 cups powdered sugar\n1/2 teaspoon natural vanilla extract\nmore strawberries and blueberries, to decorate\n2 tablespoons coconut flakes, to decorate\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 350 F and line your muffin form with 12 paper muffin liners.\nIn a large mixing bowl, combine the softened butter with the sugar and the salt and beat with a mixer until combined and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes.\nThen add the remaining ingredients and blend until until well combined. No large lumps should be left.\nDivide evenly among the cupcake/muffin holders and bake on a center rack for 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.\nTransfer them to a cooling rack and let them cool down completely.\nIn the meantime, make the frosting.  Place the vegan butter into a mixing bowl and beat until light and fluffy. Then add vanilla and powdered sugar and continue mixing until thick and creamy. The frosting is supposed to be pretty thick.\nIf you decide to make both, the strawberry AND the blueberry frosting (the first one turns out pink and the second one purple), put half of the frosting aside. Then add 4 teaspoons of the strawberry sauce and mix until well combined. Put the frosting an icing syringe or an icing bag and put on top of six of the cupcakes. Then add the blueberry sauce to the remaining frosting, mix, and do the same to the remaining six cupcakes. If you decide to only make the strawberry frosting double the amount of strawberry sauce.\nDecorate the cupcakes with strawberries, blueberries, and coconut flakes. Serve immediately or store them in the fridge.", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 43, "INGREDIENT"], [44, 51, "QUANTITY"], [52, 63, "INGREDIENT"], [72, 76, "INGREDIENT"], [77, 84, "QUANTITY"], [85, 103, "INGREDIENT"], [104, 114, "QUANTITY"], [115, 128, "INGREDIENT"], [129, 139, "QUANTITY"], [140, 153, "INGREDIENT"], [154, 167, "QUANTITY"], [168, 191, "INGREDIENT"], [192, 203, "QUANTITY"], [204, 217, "INGREDIENT"], [218, 225, "QUANTITY"], [226, 265, "INGREDIENT"], [266, 273, "QUANTITY"], [274, 314, "INGREDIENT"], [315, 322, "QUANTITY"], [323, 335, "INGREDIENT"], [336, 346, "QUANTITY"], [347, 361, "INGREDIENT"], [362, 374, "QUANTITY"], [375, 398, "INGREDIENT"], [404, 416, "INGREDIENT"], [421, 432, "INGREDIENT"], [446, 459, "QUANTITY"], [460, 487, "INGREDIENT"], [595, 601, "PROCESS"], [629, 635, "INGREDIENT"], [645, 650, "INGREDIENT"], [659, 663, "INGREDIENT"], [754, 757, "PROCESS"], [903, 907, "PROCESS"], [1118, 1130, "INGREDIENT"], [1138, 1144, "PROCESS"], [1188, 1191, "PROCESS"], [1192, 1199, "INGREDIENT"], [1204, 1218, "INGREDIENT"], [1232, 1238, "PROCESS"], [1473, 1476, "PROCESS"], [1477, 1488, "QUANTITY"], [1517, 1520, "PROCESS"], [1636, 1639, "PROCESS"], [1687, 1690, "PROCESS"], [1856, 1868, "INGREDIENT"], [1870, 1881, "INGREDIENT"], [1887, 1901, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
