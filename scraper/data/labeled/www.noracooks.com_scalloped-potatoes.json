["Ingredients:\n4 pounds yukon gold potatoes\n1 1/2  cups  raw cashews, soaked in hot water for 5 minutes\n2 cups vegetable broth\n2 cups unsweetened non-dairy milk (I used coconut milk)\n1/2 cup nutritional yeast\n1 1/2 teaspoons salt\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n1   large onion, thinly sliced\n4  large garlic cloves, minced\nOptional for serving: vegan parmesan, chopped fresh chives\n\nInstructions:\nPeel your potatoes, and slice them into 1/8 inch thick rounds. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and lightly grease a 9 x 13 inch baking dish. Set aside.\nMake the creamy sauce: Drain the cashews. In a high powered blender like a Vitamix, add all the sauce ingredients (cashews, vegetable broth, non-dairy milk, nutritional yeast and salt) and blend on high for a few minutes until very smooth.\nHeat the olive oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the sliced onion and saute for 3-4 minutes, until translucent. Now add the garlic to the pan and cook, stirring constantly for another minute. Turn off heat and set aside.\nSpread half of the sliced potatoes in the baking dish. Top evenly with half of the creamy sauce, and then add the onion/garlic mixture across the top of the sauce.&nbsp;\nLayer the rest of the potatoes, and then the rest of the sauce. Bake for 60 minutes, then check a few potatoes to make sure they are fork tender and cooked through. If not, put back in the oven for 10-20 more minutes, until done. The sauce should be bubbly and thick.\nSprinkle vegan parmesan and chopped fresh chives on top, if desired and serve.
