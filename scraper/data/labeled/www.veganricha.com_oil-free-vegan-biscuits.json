["Ingredients:\n1.5 cups flour\n1/2 tsp salt ((2/3 if you like biscuits salty))\n2.5 tsp baking power\n1/4 tsp baking soda\n2 tsp dried herbs ((I used basil, rosemary and chives, 1 tbsp if fresh))\n1/4 cup mashed sweet potato or mashed potato ((chilled for at least an hour))\n1/3 cup coconut cream ((heaping cup - chilled overnight))\n1/3 cup non dairy milk ((such as almond or soy))\n2 tsp lime juice\nVegan cheese shreds, 1 tbsp nutritional yeast, 1/2 tsp garlic powder or minced jalapeno\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 425 deg F ( 218 C). Line a thick baking sheet with parchment paper.\nAdd the flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, herbs to a shallow bowl. Whisk to mix well.\nMix the lime juice in the non dairy milk and set aside.\nAdd the chilled sweet potato mash and coconut cream. Use a pastry cutter or fork to mix them in until the flour has some even fat crumbs.\nAdd the curdled non dairy milk a few tbsp at&nbsp; a time. Use a spatula to mix it in until just about a dough.\nUse a tablespoon of flour if needed and quickly bring the dough together into a flat rectangle with the spatula or hands.\nUse a 1.5 inch cookie cutter to cut out biscuits. Place biscuits on parchment lined baking sheet just about touching each other. Press the middle of the biscuits lightly with a finger, to make a slight dip. (Freeze the shaped biscuits on a baking sheet. When frozen, store in air tight container or bag. Bake directly from the freezer. You will need to add 3 to 4 mins additional baking time for frozen biscuits)\nBake for 13 to 15 mins. Take off the sheet when done.\nBrush with vegan butter/oil if needed, or brush some aquafaba. Serve immediately with gravy of choice. These biscuits are best served warm.&nbsp;", {"entities": [[22, 27, "INGREDIENT"], [28, 35, "QUANTITY"], [36, 40, "INGREDIENT"], [84, 96, "INGREDIENT"], [97, 104, "QUANTITY"], [105, 116, "INGREDIENT"], [117, 122, "QUANTITY"], [123, 134, "INGREDIENT"], [144, 149, "INGREDIENT"], [151, 159, "INGREDIENT"], [164, 170, "INGREDIENT"], [172, 178, "QUANTITY"], [182, 187, "INGREDIENT"], [190, 197, "QUANTITY"], [198, 234, "INGREDIENT"], [268, 275, "QUANTITY"], [276, 289, "INGREDIENT"], [300, 303, "QUANTITY"], [326, 333, "QUANTITY"], [334, 348, "INGREDIENT"], [375, 380, "QUANTITY"], [381, 391, "INGREDIENT"], [392, 404, "INGREDIENT"], [413, 419, "QUANTITY"], [420, 479, "INGREDIENT"], [548, 554, "PROCESS"], [591, 596, "INGREDIENT"], [598, 602, "INGREDIENT"], [604, 617, "INGREDIENT"], [619, 630, "INGREDIENT"], [632, 637, "INGREDIENT"], [666, 669, "PROCESS"], [684, 694, "INGREDIENT"], [702, 716, "INGREDIENT"], [748, 760, "INGREDIENT"], [770, 783, "INGREDIENT"], [816, 819, "PROCESS"], [838, 843, "INGREDIENT"], [886, 900, "INGREDIENT"], [946, 949, "PROCESS"], [999, 1007, "INGREDIENT"], [1188, 1194, "PROCESS"], [1221, 1225, "INGREDIENT"], [1344, 1350, "PROCESS"], [1363, 1369, "INGREDIENT"], [1457, 1460, "PROCESS"], [1484, 1490, "PROCESS"], [1500, 1506, "INGREDIENT"], [1582, 1594, "INGREDIENT"], [1595, 1598, "INGREDIENT"], [1624, 1632, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
