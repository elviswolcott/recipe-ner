["Ingredients:\n2  medium bananas\n1/4 cup brown sugar (or use regular cane sugar and add 1 tsp molasses with wet ingredients, divided)\n1 tsp cinnamon (divided)\n1/2 tsp of vanilla extract\n2 cups of flour (I use 1.5 cup all purpose and 1/2 cup whole wheat)\n2 tbsp almond flour\n2 tsp baking powder\n1/4 tsp baking soda\n1/3 cup chopped pecans or walnuts\n1/2 tsp salt\n1 cup of coconut milk (use full fat coconut milk and at least 1/3rd cup of coconut cream. Chill the can for a few hours before using.)\n\nInstructions:\nCaramelize the bananas: slice the bananas and add to the skillet, add 2 tbsp of brown sugar and half the cinnamon and 1 tsp of coconut milk, mix and cook over medium heat until banana starts to get golden.\u00c2\u00a0 This can take 5 to 6 minutes. Once you are happy with them, let them cool down. Caramelizing the bananas adds a nice depth of flavor and  keeps the scones from getting too soft like a cake.\nPreheat oven to 435 degrees F. Line a baking sheet or dish with parchment paper.\nFor making the scones, combine the flour, almond flour, baking powder, baking soda on a large bowl and whisk well. Add the sugar, pecans, salt, and spices and mix in.\nAdd 3/4 cup of the chilled coconut cream/milk and cut with a fork to mix in. Add the caramelized bananas and continue to cut with the fork. The mixture will initially feel very dry and then start to become fat crumbs and dough-like. Add another tbsp of coconut milk as needed.Once the dough starts to form, bring it all together with a spatula or your hands. Work quickly and shape the dough into a disc. It should be at least 3/4 inches tall. Slice the dough into 6 to 8 triangles using a pizza cutter or a sharp chef\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s knife.\nPlace the scones on baking sheet and bake for 17 to 18 minutes.\nRemove from the sheet and cool and serve.", {"entities": [[31, 38, "QUANTITY"], [39, 50, "INGREDIENT"], [67, 77, "INGREDIENT"], [82, 85, "PROCESS"], [86, 91, "QUANTITY"], [92, 100, "INGREDIENT"], [132, 137, "QUANTITY"], [138, 146, "INGREDIENT"], [157, 164, "QUANTITY"], [165, 183, "INGREDIENT"], [184, 190, "QUANTITY"], [191, 199, "INGREDIENT"], [211, 214, "QUANTITY"], [231, 238, "QUANTITY"], [239, 250, "INGREDIENT"], [252, 258, "QUANTITY"], [259, 271, "INGREDIENT"], [272, 277, "QUANTITY"], [278, 291, "INGREDIENT"], [292, 299, "QUANTITY"], [300, 311, "INGREDIENT"], [312, 319, "QUANTITY"], [320, 345, "INGREDIENT"], [346, 353, "QUANTITY"], [354, 358, "INGREDIENT"], [359, 364, "QUANTITY"], [365, 380, "INGREDIENT"], [386, 407, "INGREDIENT"], [427, 430, "QUANTITY"], [431, 447, "INGREDIENT"], [459, 462, "INGREDIENT"], [555, 558, "PROCESS"], [575, 578, "PROCESS"], [579, 585, "QUANTITY"], [589, 600, "INGREDIENT"], [614, 622, "INGREDIENT"], [627, 632, "QUANTITY"], [633, 648, "INGREDIENT"], [650, 653, "PROCESS"], [658, 662, "PROCESS"], [722, 725, "INGREDIENT"], [945, 951, "PROCESS"], [1023, 1028, "INGREDIENT"], [1030, 1042, "INGREDIENT"], [1044, 1057, "INGREDIENT"], [1059, 1070, "INGREDIENT"], [1091, 1096, "PROCESS"], [1111, 1116, "INGREDIENT"], [1118, 1125, "INGREDIENT"], [1126, 1130, "INGREDIENT"], [1147, 1150, "PROCESS"], [1159, 1166, "QUANTITY"], [1182, 1195, "INGREDIENT"], [1196, 1200, "INGREDIENT"], [1224, 1227, "PROCESS"], [1405, 1420, "INGREDIENT"], [1705, 1711, "PROCESS"], [1722, 1726, "PROCESS"]]}]
