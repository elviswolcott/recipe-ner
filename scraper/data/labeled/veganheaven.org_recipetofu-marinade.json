["Ingredients:\n14 oz firm or extra-firm tofu\n2 tablespoons sesame oil\n4 tablespoons soy sauce\n2  cloves of garlic\n1 inch piece ginger\n2 tablespoons rice vinegar\n1 teaspoon paprika powder\n1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika powder\n1 teaspoon maple syrup\n1 teaspoon onion powder\nred pepper flakes\n\nInstructions:\nStart by pressing your tofu. Remove the tofu from the packaging.Then wrap it with a clean dishtowel. Alternatively, you could also use paper towels.Cover with a baking sheet and then place something heavy on top. I usually use a stack of cookbooks. But you could also use cans of beans, a cast iron skillet, or smaller weights you use for weight lifting exercises.&nbsp;Let it press for about 10-15 minutes.&nbsp;\nIn the meantime, make the tofu marinade.&nbsp;Cut the garlic and the ginger into thin slices. In an airtight container or a bowl, combine all of the ingredients and whisk well.&nbsp;\nAfter the tofu has been pressed for about 10-15 minutes, cut it into cubes. &nbsp;Then add it to the tofu marinade and carefully stir with a spoon until all of the tofu cubes are covered.&nbsp;\nCover the container and store it in the fridge for at least 1-2 hours. If you have enough time, I recommend letting the tofu marinate overnight. This way it will be even more flavorful.&nbsp;\nTo pan-fry the marinated tofu:Heat some oil in a frying pan or in a cast iron skillet.Add the marinated tofu, but leave the rest of the tofu marinade behind (you can use it later if you want). Fry the tofu until golden brown.&nbsp;\nHow to bake the marinated tofu:Preheat your oven to 350 F.&nbsp;After the tofu has been marinated for at least 1-2 hours, place it in a bowl leaving the remaining tofu marinade behind.Add two tablespoons of corn starch (for 14 ounces of tofu). Make sure all cubes are covered in corn starch. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and place the tofu cubes on top.Bake for 25 minutes, tossing halfway.&nbsp;\nServe over brown rice and sprinkle with chopped green onions. I also like to add a bit of sriracha on top.&nbsp;", {"entities": [[13, 18, "QUANTITY"], [19, 42, "INGREDIENT"], [43, 56, "QUANTITY"], [57, 67, "INGREDIENT"], [68, 81, "QUANTITY"], [82, 91, "INGREDIENT"], [95, 101, "INGREDIENT"], [105, 111, "INGREDIENT"], [125, 131, "INGREDIENT"], [132, 145, "QUANTITY"], [146, 158, "INGREDIENT"], [159, 169, "QUANTITY"], [170, 184, "INGREDIENT"], [185, 197, "QUANTITY"], [198, 219, "INGREDIENT"], [220, 230, "QUANTITY"], [231, 242, "INGREDIENT"], [243, 253, "QUANTITY"], [254, 266, "INGREDIENT"], [267, 284, "INGREDIENT"], [309, 317, "PROCESS"], [323, 327, "INGREDIENT"], [340, 344, "INGREDIENT"], [369, 373, "PROCESS"], [461, 467, "PROCESS"], [483, 488, "PROCESS"], [677, 682, "PROCESS"], [740, 744, "INGREDIENT"], [768, 774, "INGREDIENT"], [783, 789, "INGREDIENT"], [795, 799, "PROCESS"], [879, 884, "PROCESS"], [907, 911, "INGREDIENT"], [921, 928, "PROCESS"], [984, 987, "PROCESS"], [998, 1002, "INGREDIENT"], [1026, 1030, "PROCESS"], [1061, 1065, "INGREDIENT"], [1211, 1215, "INGREDIENT"], [1290, 1293, "PROCESS"], [1308, 1312, "INGREDIENT"], [1323, 1326, "INGREDIENT"], [1332, 1338, "PROCESS"], [1387, 1391, "INGREDIENT"], [1419, 1423, "INGREDIENT"], [1445, 1448, "INGREDIENT"], [1484, 1488, "INGREDIENT"], [1522, 1526, "PROCESS"], [1541, 1545, "INGREDIENT"], [1589, 1593, "INGREDIENT"], [1637, 1642, "PROCESS"], [1678, 1682, "INGREDIENT"], [1722, 1733, "INGREDIENT"], [1739, 1748, "QUANTITY"], [1752, 1756, "INGREDIENT"], [1794, 1805, "INGREDIENT"], [1814, 1820, "PROCESS"], [1852, 1857, "PROCESS"], [1862, 1866, "INGREDIENT"], [1935, 1945, "INGREDIENT"], [1950, 1958, "PROCESS"], [1964, 1984, "INGREDIENT"], [2001, 2004, "PROCESS"], [2014, 2022, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
