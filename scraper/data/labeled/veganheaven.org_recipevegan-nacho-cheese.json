["Ingredients:\n2 1/2 cups uncooked cubed potatoes\n1 1/2 cups uncooked cubed carrots\n5  pickled jalape\u00c3\u00b1os\n1 tablespoon tomato paste\n1/2 cup nutritional yeast\n1 tablespoon yellow miso paste\n1/2 cup unsweetened non-dairy milk  ((almond or soy milk))\n1/4 cup cashews ((unsalted and not roasted))\n1 teaspoon onion powder\n1 teaspoon garlic powder\n1/4 cup canola oil or olive oil\n1/2 teaspoon hot sauce\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n1 tablespoon lemon juice\n1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika powder\n\nInstructions:\nPeel the potatoes and the carrots. Cut them into small cubes. Cook until soft. I usually use my Instant Pot to cook them.&nbsp;\nOnce the potatoes and the carrots are soft, transfer them to a high speed blender together with the remaining ingredients.&nbsp;\nProcess until smooth. This will take about a minute.&nbsp;\nTransfer to a small pot and cook for a minute. The vegan nacho sauce will thicken up when being heated.\u00c2\u00a0\nServe with nachos and sprinkle with chopped jalape\u00c3\u00b1os. I also added a bit of salsa in the middle of the bowl. Enjoy!&nbsp;", {"entities": [[13, 23, "QUANTITY"], [24, 47, "INGREDIENT"], [48, 58, "QUANTITY"], [59, 81, "INGREDIENT"], [104, 116, "QUANTITY"], [117, 129, "INGREDIENT"], [130, 137, "QUANTITY"], [138, 155, "INGREDIENT"], [156, 168, "QUANTITY"], [169, 186, "INGREDIENT"], [187, 194, "QUANTITY"], [195, 221, "INGREDIENT"], [225, 243, "INGREDIENT"], [246, 253, "QUANTITY"], [254, 261, "INGREDIENT"], [281, 288, "PROCESS"], [291, 301, "QUANTITY"], [302, 314, "INGREDIENT"], [315, 325, "QUANTITY"], [326, 339, "INGREDIENT"], [340, 347, "QUANTITY"], [348, 371, "INGREDIENT"], [372, 384, "QUANTITY"], [385, 394, "INGREDIENT"], [395, 407, "QUANTITY"], [408, 412, "INGREDIENT"], [413, 425, "QUANTITY"], [426, 437, "INGREDIENT"], [438, 450, "QUANTITY"], [451, 472, "INGREDIENT"], [497, 505, "INGREDIENT"], [514, 521, "INGREDIENT"], [599, 603, "PROCESS"], [625, 633, "INGREDIENT"], [642, 649, "INGREDIENT"], [832, 836, "PROCESS"], [921, 927, "INGREDIENT"], [932, 940, "PROCESS"], [946, 953, "INGREDIENT"], [973, 978, "PROCESS"], [988, 993, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
