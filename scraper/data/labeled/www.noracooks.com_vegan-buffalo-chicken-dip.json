["Ingredients:\n2 cups raw cashews\n1 cup water\n3 tablespoons lemon juice\n1 1/2 teaspoons salt\n2 teaspoons garlic powder\n2 teaspoons onion powder\n1 cup buffalo sauce\n(1) 14-ounce can artichoke hearts, drained (| in water, NOT marinated in oil)\ncelery sticks, carrot sticks\ntortilla chips\ncrackers or sliced baguette\nchopped green onions\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees F.\nSoak the cashews:\u00c2\u00a0Heat up about 3 cups of water in a tea kettle or small pot. Pour the boiling hot water over the cashews and let them soak for 5 minutes. Drain them when ready to blend.\nIn a high powered blender such as a\u00c2\u00a0Vitamix, add the soaked, drained cashews, 1 cup of fresh water, lemon juice, salt, garlic powder and onion powder. Blend until very smooth.\nNow add the buffalo sauce and artichokes. Pulse a couple of times, but do not blend. You want to leave quite a bit of chunky texture!\nTransfer to an oven safe dish (1 1/2-2 quarts, a pie pan works as well), and bake for 25-30 minutes.\u00c2\u00a0\nServe warm with celery sticks, carrot sticks, tortilla chips, crackers or a sliced baguette. Chopped green onions on top look pretty and taste good, too.
