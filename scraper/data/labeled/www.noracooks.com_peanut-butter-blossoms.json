["Ingredients:\n1/2 cup vegan butter, softened\n3/4 cup creamy peanut butter\n1/2 cup granulated sugar\n1/2 cup brown sugar\n2 tablespoons almond milk\n1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n1 1/4 cups all purpose flour\n3/4 teaspoon baking soda\n1/2 teaspoon baking powder\n2 tablespoons cornstarch\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n1/4 cup granulated sugar, for rolling\n22  vegan chocolate kisses, chocolate chunks or ganache, see Notes\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Add 1/4 cup sugar to a small bowl and set aside (for rolling the cookies in).\nIn a large bowl, cream together the vegan butter, peanut butter and sugars. Stir in the almond milk and vanilla until well combined. You can use a hand mixer, stand mixer or just a large wooden spoon.\nNow add the flour to the bowl, and sprinkle the baking soda, baking powder, cornstarch and salt on top of the flour. Stir (or use the mixer) until just combined and a dough is formed. The dough will be thick, yet sticky.\nRoll balls of dough (about 1.5 tablespoons) and then roll in the sugar until coated. Place each one on the prepared baking sheet about 2 inches apart.\nBake for 10-12 minutes, until they are lightly golden on top.\nRemove from the oven and allow them to cool on the baking sheet for about 10 minutes, then press a kiss (or piece of chocolate, or ganache) into each cookie until it sticks. Immediately place the baking sheet in the freezer for about 10 minutes so the chocolate doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t melt into the cookie. Only do one baking sheet at a time unless you have a lot of room in your freezer.\nRemove from the freezer, eat and enjoy! Leftover cookies will keep for up to 5 days in a covered container at room temperature, and they can also be frozen.", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 43, "INGREDIENT"], [44, 51, "QUANTITY"], [52, 72, "INGREDIENT"], [73, 80, "QUANTITY"], [81, 97, "INGREDIENT"], [98, 105, "QUANTITY"], [106, 117, "INGREDIENT"], [118, 131, "QUANTITY"], [132, 143, "INGREDIENT"], [144, 154, "QUANTITY"], [155, 175, "INGREDIENT"], [176, 186, "QUANTITY"], [187, 204, "INGREDIENT"], [205, 217, "QUANTITY"], [218, 229, "INGREDIENT"], [230, 242, "QUANTITY"], [243, 256, "INGREDIENT"], [257, 270, "QUANTITY"], [271, 281, "INGREDIENT"], [282, 294, "QUANTITY"], [295, 299, "INGREDIENT"], [300, 307, "QUANTITY"], [308, 337, "INGREDIENT"], [348, 357, "INGREDIENT"], [366, 375, "INGREDIENT"], [465, 471, "PROCESS"], [504, 511, "QUANTITY"], [512, 517, "INGREDIENT"], [614, 626, "INGREDIENT"], [628, 641, "INGREDIENT"], [666, 677, "INGREDIENT"], [682, 689, "INGREDIENT"], [715, 718, "INGREDIENT"], [783, 786, "PROCESS"], [791, 796, "INGREDIENT"], [814, 822, "PROCESS"], [827, 838, "INGREDIENT"], [840, 853, "INGREDIENT"], [855, 865, "INGREDIENT"], [870, 874, "INGREDIENT"], [889, 894, "INGREDIENT"], [1065, 1070, "INGREDIENT"], [1091, 1095, "INGREDIENT"], [1116, 1122, "PROCESS"], [1264, 1270, "PROCESS"], [1304, 1309, "PROCESS"], [1330, 1339, "INGREDIENT"], [1358, 1362, "INGREDIENT"], [1399, 1404, "PROCESS"], [1409, 1415, "PROCESS"], [1465, 1474, "INGREDIENT"], [1519, 1525, "PROCESS"], [1726, 1729, "INGREDIENT"], [1738, 1744, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
