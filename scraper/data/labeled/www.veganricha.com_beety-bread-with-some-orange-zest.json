["Ingredients:\n1 cup whole wheat flour\n3-4 cups bread flour\n1  packet quick rise yeast\n4 tablespoons brown sugar\n2 tablespoons honey\n1 teaspoon salt\n1 tablespoon vegan butter\n1  medium sized beet peeled (chopped and then coarsely pureed in a blender.)\n1 tablespoon fresh orange zest\n2/3 cup water\noil for greasing\n\nInstructions:\nPuree the chopped and peeled beet with little water, honey and salt to form a coarse puree. It will look like finely grated beet in some pulp. Keep aside.\nIn a small bowl, add 1/4 cup (60ml) warm water and yeast and 1 teaspoon brown sugar and mix well. Wait until the mixture becomes frothy. 10 minutes.\nGrease the mixer bowl and add the flours, zest, softened butter and rest of the sugar and beet puree and mix well.\nAdd in the yeast mixture and the remaining water and knead for 8-10 minutes (batches of 3 minutes) Add more flour or water if required.\nThe dough should leave the sides and be soft ant not sticky.\nPlace dough in well greased container covered in a warm place for an 80 minutes.\nPunch the dough down and use some flour to knead it to make it less sticky. The dough will be sticky after the rise because of the extra moisture from the beets.\nShape the loaf by pulling on all sides and tucking under and place in well greased bread pan.\nCover with a kitchen towel and let rise for 45 minutes.\nBake at 375 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until the bread looks nice and brown and sounds hollow.\nCool completely before slicing. Since hubby was freaking out on the color of the bread, I toasted the slices to a nice brown to serve him with the breakfast! I love the color though!", {"entities": [[13, 18, "QUANTITY"], [19, 36, "INGREDIENT"], [41, 57, "INGREDIENT"], [68, 84, "INGREDIENT"], [85, 98, "QUANTITY"], [99, 110, "INGREDIENT"], [111, 124, "QUANTITY"], [125, 130, "INGREDIENT"], [131, 141, "QUANTITY"], [142, 146, "INGREDIENT"], [147, 159, "QUANTITY"], [160, 172, "INGREDIENT"], [202, 209, "INGREDIENT"], [250, 262, "QUANTITY"], [263, 280, "INGREDIENT"], [281, 288, "QUANTITY"], [289, 294, "INGREDIENT"], [295, 311, "INGREDIENT"], [337, 344, "INGREDIENT"], [373, 378, "INGREDIENT"], [380, 385, "INGREDIENT"], [390, 394, "INGREDIENT"], [412, 417, "INGREDIENT"], [444, 450, "INGREDIENT"], [499, 502, "PROCESS"], [503, 510, "QUANTITY"], [518, 528, "INGREDIENT"], [533, 538, "INGREDIENT"], [543, 553, "QUANTITY"], [554, 565, "INGREDIENT"], [570, 573, "PROCESS"], [657, 660, "PROCESS"], [688, 694, "INGREDIENT"], [711, 716, "INGREDIENT"], [721, 731, "INGREDIENT"], [736, 739, "PROCESS"], [757, 762, "INGREDIENT"], [789, 794, "INGREDIENT"], [799, 804, "PROCESS"], [854, 859, "INGREDIENT"], [863, 868, "INGREDIENT"], [999, 1004, "PROCESS"], [1058, 1063, "INGREDIENT"], [1067, 1072, "PROCESS"], [1247, 1252, "PROCESS"]]}]
