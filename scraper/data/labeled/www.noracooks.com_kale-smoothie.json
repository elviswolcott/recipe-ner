["Ingredients:\n2 cups chopped kale\n1 1/2 cups frozen mango chunks\n2  medjool dates, pits removed\n2 tablespoons hemp, chia or flax seeds\n1 lemon, juice squeezed (about 2 tablespoons)\n1/2 inch piece fresh ginger, optional\n1-1 1/2 cups water\n\nInstructions:\nAdd all ingredients to a\u00c2\u00a0high powered blender\u00c2\u00a0and blend until creamy and smooth. Start with 1 cup of water, and if it&#x27;s too thick add the extra 1/2 cup. I tend to enjoy a thinner smoothie so I use the full 1 1/2 cups of water.\nServe immediately. It makes either one large serving, or two smaller servings.", {"entities": [[13, 19, "QUANTITY"], [20, 32, "INGREDIENT"], [33, 43, "QUANTITY"], [44, 63, "INGREDIENT"], [75, 80, "INGREDIENT"], [95, 108, "QUANTITY"], [109, 133, "INGREDIENT"], [165, 178, "QUANTITY"], [195, 207, "INGREDIENT"], [220, 230, "QUANTITY"], [231, 236, "INGREDIENT"], [346, 351, "QUANTITY"], [352, 360, "INGREDIENT"], [389, 392, "PROCESS"], [403, 410, "QUANTITY"], [465, 475, "QUANTITY"], [476, 484, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
