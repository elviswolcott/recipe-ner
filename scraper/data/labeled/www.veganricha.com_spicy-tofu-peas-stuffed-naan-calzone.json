Add cumin seeeds and cook for a minute or until they change color. Add onions, chili and garlic and cook until just about translucent. 3-4 minutes.\nAdd spices and mix well. Add tomato, water and nutritional yeast, mix and cook for 4 to 5 minutes or until tomatoes are saucy.\nMash/crumble the tofu with hands or chop small and add to the pan. Add the peas. Mix well, cover and cook for 5 minutes. If the scramble begins to stick, deglaze with a Tbsp of water. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t press the Tofu before use, so usually there is enough moisture to prevent sticking.\nTaste and adjust salt and spice. Lower the heat to low-medium and cook for another 3-5 minutes.\nSprinkle black pepper, lemon juice and cilantro(optional) and keep aside to cool.\nMake Calzones: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F / 200c.

Drizzle a little bbq sauce or sriracha or mango chutney other sauce of choice (optional). Fold the other half over to form a half moon and seal with a fork. Shape all the calzones and place on parchment lined baking sheet.\nSpray water generously on the calzones. Sprinkle nigella seeds and press in.Let them sit for 5 to 10 minutes.\nBake for 11 to 14 minutes or until golden. Brush melted vegan butter and serve with marinara, mango chutney or other sauce/dip of choice.", {"entities": [[33, 38, "QUANTITY"], [39, 42, "INGREDIENT"], [50, 57, "QUANTITY"], [58, 69, "INGREDIENT"], [70, 77, "QUANTITY"], [78, 87, "INGREDIENT"], [109, 115, "INGREDIENT"], [119, 125, "INGREDIENT"], [126, 132, "INGREDIENT"], [133, 140, "QUANTITY"], [141, 148, "INGREDIENT"], [149, 156, "QUANTITY"], [157, 173, "INGREDIENT"], [174, 181, "QUANTITY"], [182, 196, "INGREDIENT"], [202, 214, "INGREDIENT"], [216, 223, "QUANTITY"], [224, 239, "INGREDIENT"], [247, 254, "QUANTITY"], [255, 262, "INGREDIENT"], [263, 270, "QUANTITY"], [271, 318, "INGREDIENT"], [340, 346, "INGREDIENT"], [347, 354, "INGREDIENT"], [361, 367, "QUANTITY"], [368, 373, "INGREDIENT"], [374, 379, "QUANTITY"], [380, 397, "INGREDIENT"], [409, 414, "QUANTITY"], [415, 429, "INGREDIENT"], [471, 478, "QUANTITY"], [479, 489, "INGREDIENT"], [501, 507, "INGREDIENT"], [516, 523, "QUANTITY"], [524, 528, "INGREDIENT"], [561, 576, "INGREDIENT"], [577, 588, "INGREDIENT"], [593, 613, "INGREDIENT"], [614, 626, "INGREDIENT"], [634, 647, "INGREDIENT"], [652, 664, "INGREDIENT"], [767, 771, "INGREDIENT"], [790, 793, "INGREDIENT"], [829, 834, "INGREDIENT"], [846, 850, "PROCESS"], [896, 902, "INGREDIENT"], [914, 920, "INGREDIENT"], [925, 929, "PROCESS"], [988, 991, "PROCESS"], [1002, 1008, "INGREDIENT"], [1010, 1015, "INGREDIENT"], [1020, 1037, "INGREDIENT"], [1039, 1042, "PROCESS"], [1047, 1051, "PROCESS"], [1080, 1088, "INGREDIENT"], [1117, 1121, "INGREDIENT"], [1151, 1154, "PROCESS"], [1175, 1179, "INGREDIENT"], [1201, 1205, "PROCESS"], [1274, 1282, "INGREDIENT"], [1294, 1299, "PROCESS"], [1304, 1308, "INGREDIENT"], [1395, 1399, "INGREDIENT"], [1404, 1409, "INGREDIENT"], [1444, 1448, "PROCESS"], [1483, 1495, "INGREDIENT"], [1497, 1508, "INGREDIENT"], [1655, 1659, "INGREDIENT"], [1687, 1691, "INGREDIENT"], [1733, 1752, "INGREDIENT"], [1781, 1790, "INGREDIENT"], [1794, 1802, "INGREDIENT"], [1948, 1953, "PROCESS"], [1973, 1979, "PROCESS"], [1993, 1998, "INGREDIENT"], [2036, 2049, "INGREDIENT"], [2054, 2059, "PROCESS"], [2146, 2165, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
