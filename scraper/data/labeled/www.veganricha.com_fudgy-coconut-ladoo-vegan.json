Blend a few short cycles, move the coconut around and pulse more to avoid making coconut butter. Pound the cardamom seeds in a mortar and pestle to break into a coarse mixture and mix with the coconut.\nHeat the coconut milk in a small skillet at medium heat. Add oil, sugar and salt and mix in. Bring the mixture to a bubbling boil (about 4 mins). continue to boil for another 4 minutes or until the mixture can form a half thread. (220 to 225 deg F temperature). Take off heat.\nImmediately add 1.5 cups of the shredded coconut and cardamom and mix in. Add the coconut flour and mix in. If the mixture appears too wet, let it cool for a minute, Then add more shredded coconut 2 Tbsp at a time. Do not add more than 4 Tbsp else the laddoos will be dryer. The mixture becomes less wet as it cools. Let the mixture cool for 2 minutes then shape into balls by picking up 1 to 2 Tbsp of the mixture, pressing and shaping with one hand. Roll the ball in the remaining shredded coconut and serve. Cool completely before storing. Store in an airtight container on the counter for upto 3 days or refrigerated for a week.", {"entities": [[13, 19, "QUANTITY"], [20, 54, "INGREDIENT"], [55, 60, "INGREDIENT"], [73, 81, "INGREDIENT"], [87, 94, "QUANTITY"], [95, 116, "INGREDIENT"], [117, 122, "QUANTITY"], [123, 134, "INGREDIENT"], [135, 142, "QUANTITY"], [143, 170, "INGREDIENT"], [208, 221, "INGREDIENT"], [222, 228, "QUANTITY"], [229, 242, "INGREDIENT"], [273, 279, "QUANTITY"], [280, 294, "INGREDIENT"], [386, 393, "INGREDIENT"], [432, 446, "INGREDIENT"], [458, 472, "INGREDIENT"], [531, 534, "PROCESS"], [544, 551, "INGREDIENT"], [562, 574, "INGREDIENT"], [614, 617, "INGREDIENT"], [619, 624, "INGREDIENT"], [629, 633, "INGREDIENT"], [638, 641, "PROCESS"], [678, 682, "PROCESS"], [711, 715, "PROCESS"], [759, 762, "INGREDIENT"], [842, 845, "PROCESS"], [862, 878, "INGREDIENT"], [883, 891, "INGREDIENT"], [896, 899, "PROCESS"], [912, 925, "INGREDIENT"], [930, 933, "PROCESS"], [1001, 1004, "PROCESS"], [1010, 1026, "INGREDIENT"], [1027, 1033, "QUANTITY"], [1052, 1055, "PROCESS"], [1066, 1072, "QUANTITY"], [1223, 1229, "QUANTITY"], [1246, 1254, "PROCESS"], [1313, 1329, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
