["Ingredients:\n5 tablespoons vegan butter, melted\n1 cup granulated sugar\n1 tablespoon ground flaxseeds\n1/3 cup unsweetened soy milk\n1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n3/4 teaspoon vegan friendly red food coloring*\n1 1/2 cups all purpose flour\n1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder\n1 teaspoon baking powder\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n1/2 cup granulated sugar\n3/4 cup  powdered sugar\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with\u00c2\u00a0parchment paper.\nIn a large bowl, add the melted vegan butter and sugar. Stir with a wooden spoon until well combined and smooth. Add the ground flax seeds, soy milk, vanilla and red food coloring. Stir or whisk well to combine.\nSift in the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt using either a\u00c2\u00a0sifter\u00c2\u00a0or\u00c2\u00a0fine mesh strainer.\u00c2\u00a0Stir until combined with the wet ingredients and a soft dough is formed.\u00c2\u00a0\nFill one small bowl with the granulated sugar and another with the powdered sugar. Using a cookie scoop (or spoon), scoop 1 1/2 tablespoon sized balls of dough. Roll the ball in the granulated sugar first, then in the powdered sugar very generously, covering all sides.\u00c2\u00a0The more powdered sugar, the prettier the cookies will be.\nPlace the balls onto the prepared baking sheet, about 2 inches apart so they have room to spread.\nBake in the center rack of the oven for 11-13 minutes until set and cracks have formed. They will appear slightly undercooked and soft, but will firm up as they cool.\nCool on the baking sheet for at least 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack. Store any extra cookies in an airtight container for 4-5 days. They can also be frozen.
