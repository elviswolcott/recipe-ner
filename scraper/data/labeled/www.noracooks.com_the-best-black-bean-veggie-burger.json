["Ingredients:\n1/4 cup ground flax\n1/2 cup water\n3 cups cooked black beans (2 15-oz cans, drained and rinsed)\n1 cup cashews (*see notes for options)\n1 1/2 cups cooked brown rice\n1/2 cup chopped parsely\n1 1/2 cups shredded carrots\n1/3 cup chopped green onions\n1 cup bread crumbs (*see notes for gluten free)\n2 tablespoons smoked paprika\n1 tablespoon chili powder\n1-2 teaspoons  salt, to taste\nburger buns of choice\nlettuce, arugula, spinach or other leafy greens\ntomato slices\nred onion slices\nvegan mayo, mustard, ketchup, pickles\nvegan cheese slices\n\nInstructions:\nIn a small bowl, combine the ground flax and water. Give it a little stir and set aside.\u00c2\u00a0This is your flax egg mixture.\nIn a large bowl, add the drained and rinsed black beans. Mash with a potato masher (or fork) until most of the beans are a paste. Leave about 1/4 of the beans whole.\nPlace the cashews in a food processor, and pulse until they are breadcrumb size, NOT a powder. It&#039;s okay if a few larger pieces remain. You could instead chop them with a large knife. Add to the bowl with the beans.\nNow add the flax/water mix to the bowl with the beans/nuts as well as all the remaining ingredients. Mix very well with a large wooden spoon.\u00c2\u00a0\nUsing about 1/2 cup per burger, shape into burger patty shapes about 3/4 inch thick.\u00c2\u00a0", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 32, "INGREDIENT"], [33, 40, "QUANTITY"], [41, 46, "INGREDIENT"], [47, 53, "QUANTITY"], [54, 72, "INGREDIENT"], [108, 113, "QUANTITY"], [114, 121, "INGREDIENT"], [147, 157, "QUANTITY"], [158, 175, "INGREDIENT"], [176, 183, "QUANTITY"], [184, 199, "INGREDIENT"], [200, 210, "QUANTITY"], [211, 227, "INGREDIENT"], [228, 235, "QUANTITY"], [236, 256, "INGREDIENT"], [257, 262, "QUANTITY"], [263, 275, "INGREDIENT"], [305, 318, "QUANTITY"], [319, 333, "INGREDIENT"], [334, 346, "QUANTITY"], [347, 359, "INGREDIENT"], [362, 373, "QUANTITY"], [375, 389, "INGREDIENT"], [421, 428, "INGREDIENT"], [430, 437, "INGREDIENT"], [460, 466, "INGREDIENT"], [474, 490, "INGREDIENT"], [491, 501, "INGREDIENT"], [503, 510, "INGREDIENT"], [512, 519, "INGREDIENT"], [529, 541, "INGREDIENT"], [593, 604, "INGREDIENT"], [609, 614, "INGREDIENT"], [633, 637, "PROCESS"], [702, 705, "PROCESS"], [729, 740, "INGREDIENT"], [754, 760, "INGREDIENT"], [808, 813, "INGREDIENT"], [861, 868, "INGREDIENT"], [1076, 1079, "PROCESS"], [1089, 1094, "INGREDIENT"], [1095, 1098, "PROCESS"], [1126, 1130, "INGREDIENT"], [1228, 1235, "QUANTITY"]]}]
