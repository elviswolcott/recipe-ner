["Ingredients:\n1 cup flour\n1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder\n1/4 teaspoon baking soda\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n1/3 cup cane sugar\n1/4 cup cocoa powder (preferably Dutch processed)\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract or vanilla bean powder\n1/2 cup non-dairy milk (such almond, oat or soy )\n1/4 cup oil\n1/4 cup cocoa powder\n3 tablespoons cane sugar\n1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon boiling water\n3 tablespoons maple syrup\n3 tablespoons cherry preserves or cherry compote for swirling in (see notes for cherry compote recipe )\n\nInstructions:\nMake the batter : Add the flour, baking powder, soda, salt, sugar, cocoa powder to a bowl and mix well. Add in the wet ingredients - non-dairy milk, oil,  vanilla extract and mix well.\nIf the batter is too thick, add in milk 1-2 teaspoons at a time to make it somewhat thick muffin like but not too stiff batter.\nGrease an 8x8 inch brownie pan or 8-inch round cake pan or a similar-sized pan. Preheat the oven to 350 F (180c).Add the batter to the pan and even it out with a spatula.\nTopping: In a bowl, mix the cocoa powder and sugar and distribute it all over this batter. Drizzle cherry preserves or compote.\nIn another bowl, add the water and the maple syrup and heat it until it&#39;s boiling either in the microwave or you can heat it in the saucepan.\nThen pour \u00c2\u00a0the boiling water and maple mixture in the pan over the batter.\nBake: Immediately Put pan\u00c2\u00a0in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 c ) and bake it for 24-30 minutes.\nThe bake time depends on the pan you are using. For the regular metal pans, check at about 24 minutes whether the cake is done. The top should be set and not liquid in the middle. It will be soft and Fudgy pudding at the bottom but the top should be kind of set.\nIf you are using a thicker pan like a ceramic dish or glass pan then check at 28-30 minutes.\nRemove the pan from the oven. Let it sit for 4-5 minutes. Top it with ice cream of choice and serve", {"entities": [[13, 18, "QUANTITY"], [19, 24, "INGREDIENT"], [25, 39, "QUANTITY"], [40, 53, "INGREDIENT"], [54, 66, "QUANTITY"], [67, 78, "INGREDIENT"], [79, 91, "QUANTITY"], [92, 96, "INGREDIENT"], [97, 104, "QUANTITY"], [105, 115, "INGREDIENT"], [116, 123, "QUANTITY"], [124, 136, "INGREDIENT"], [166, 176, "QUANTITY"], [177, 215, "INGREDIENT"], [216, 223, "QUANTITY"], [224, 238, "INGREDIENT"], [266, 273, "QUANTITY"], [274, 277, "INGREDIENT"], [278, 285, "QUANTITY"], [286, 298, "INGREDIENT"], [299, 312, "QUANTITY"], [313, 323, "INGREDIENT"], [324, 331, "QUANTITY"], [332, 363, "INGREDIENT"], [364, 377, "QUANTITY"], [378, 389, "INGREDIENT"], [390, 403, "QUANTITY"], [404, 454, "INGREDIENT"], [535, 540, "INGREDIENT"], [542, 555, "INGREDIENT"], [563, 567, "INGREDIENT"], [569, 574, "INGREDIENT"], [576, 588, "INGREDIENT"], [603, 606, "PROCESS"], [642, 656, "INGREDIENT"], [658, 661, "INGREDIENT"], [664, 679, "INGREDIENT"], [684, 687, "PROCESS"], [722, 725, "PROCESS"], [729, 733, "INGREDIENT"], [736, 747, "QUANTITY"], [1013, 1016, "PROCESS"], [1021, 1033, "INGREDIENT"], [1038, 1043, "INGREDIENT"], [1138, 1141, "PROCESS"], [1146, 1151, "INGREDIENT"], [1160, 1171, "INGREDIENT"], [1199, 1206, "PROCESS"], [1238, 1241, "INGREDIENT"], [1283, 1296, "INGREDIENT"], [1301, 1306, "INGREDIENT"], [1421, 1425, "PROCESS"], [1452, 1456, "PROCESS"], [1874, 1877, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
