["Ingredients:\n1/3 cup cashews\n1/3 cup almonds\nwater\n1/4 cup quick cooking oats\n5-6 Tablespoons raw sugar or jaggery\n1 Tablespoon of softened vegan butter (or high fat oil)\n1/2 teaspoon saffron\n1/2 teaspoon cardamom powder\n1 teaspoon of arrowroot/cornstarch powder\n\nInstructions:\nSoak cashews and almonds overnight (I used 1/3 cup each). Nuke them in the microwave for a minute with a little water. You can also soak them for an hour and then nuke them in the microwave for 2-3 minutes. or blanch/cook in hot water for 2 minutes.\nPuree the cashews and almonds with about 1/3 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 1/2 cup warm-(more towards hot) water to make a creamy puree. I did not peel the almonds, you can peel them if your blender doesnt puree the mix smooth enough with the peel.\nAdd some quick cooking oats( 1/4 cup), 5-6 tablespoons raw sugar or jaggery(depending on the sweetness wanted) and a Tablespoon of softened vegan butter or high fat oil, 1/2 teaspoon saffron, 1/2 teaspoon cardamom powder and blend again. Add a little water if needed to get a thick puree consistency.\nThis puree now can be frozen as is, in popsicles or any container, or put in the icecream maker.", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 28, "INGREDIENT"], [29, 36, "QUANTITY"], [37, 44, "INGREDIENT"], [45, 50, "INGREDIENT"], [51, 58, "QUANTITY"], [59, 77, "INGREDIENT"], [80, 93, "QUANTITY"], [94, 114, "INGREDIENT"], [115, 127, "QUANTITY"], [128, 152, "INGREDIENT"], [157, 169, "INGREDIENT"], [171, 183, "QUANTITY"], [184, 191, "INGREDIENT"], [192, 204, "QUANTITY"], [205, 220, "INGREDIENT"], [221, 231, "QUANTITY"], [232, 262, "INGREDIENT"], [283, 290, "INGREDIENT"], [295, 302, "INGREDIENT"], [321, 328, "QUANTITY"], [329, 333, "INGREDIENT"], [390, 395, "INGREDIENT"], [401, 404, "INGREDIENT"], [488, 494, "PROCESS"], [495, 499, "PROCESS"], [503, 512, "INGREDIENT"], [538, 545, "INGREDIENT"], [550, 557, "INGREDIENT"], [577, 584, "QUANTITY"], [609, 614, "INGREDIENT"], [632, 637, "INGREDIENT"], [658, 665, "INGREDIENT"], [671, 674, "INGREDIENT"], [708, 713, "INGREDIENT"], [718, 721, "PROCESS"], [760, 778, "INGREDIENT"], [780, 787, "QUANTITY"], [792, 805, "QUANTITY"], [806, 815, "INGREDIENT"], [879, 903, "INGREDIENT"], [907, 919, "INGREDIENT"], [921, 933, "QUANTITY"], [934, 941, "INGREDIENT"], [943, 955, "QUANTITY"], [956, 971, "INGREDIENT"], [1002, 1007, "INGREDIENT"], [1033, 1038, "INGREDIENT"], [1057, 1062, "INGREDIENT"], [1067, 1070, "INGREDIENT"], [1074, 1080, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
