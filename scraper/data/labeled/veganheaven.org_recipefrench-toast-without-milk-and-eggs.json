["Ingredients:\n1  banana\n1 cup almond milk or other plant-based milk\n1 teaspoon cinnamon\n1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract\n6 slices bread\ncoconut oil\n1/2 can very thick coconut milk (full fat) ((chill in the fridge overnight))\nstrawberries\nraspberries\nblueberries\n\nInstructions:\nChill your coconut cream in the fridge overnight (make sure not to shake it so the cream and the liquid keeps separate).\nMash the banana with a fork in a shallow bowl and add the almond milk together with the cinnamon and the vanilla extract.\nThen dip each slice of bread into the banana almond milk mixture for about 10 to 15 seconds. In a large pan, heat some coconut oil over medium heat and cook each side until golden. For me, this took about 3-4 minutes on each side.\nMake the coconut cream: Place the hardened cream in a mixing bowl. Beat for 30 seconds with a mixer or until creamy. If you like you can add some agave or a sweetener of your choice.\nServe the vegan French toast with the coconut cream and the berries.", {"entities": [[23, 28, "QUANTITY"], [29, 66, "INGREDIENT"], [67, 77, "QUANTITY"], [78, 86, "INGREDIENT"], [87, 99, "QUANTITY"], [100, 115, "INGREDIENT"], [131, 142, "INGREDIENT"], [147, 150, "INGREDIENT"], [151, 174, "INGREDIENT"], [220, 232, "INGREDIENT"], [233, 244, "INGREDIENT"], [245, 256, "INGREDIENT"], [283, 296, "INGREDIENT"], [443, 446, "PROCESS"], [451, 462, "INGREDIENT"], [481, 489, "INGREDIENT"], [498, 513, "INGREDIENT"], [524, 528, "INGREDIENT"], [560, 571, "INGREDIENT"], [634, 645, "INGREDIENT"], [667, 671, "PROCESS"], [672, 676, "INGREDIENT"], [735, 739, "INGREDIENT"], [755, 768, "INGREDIENT"], [800, 806, "PROCESS"], [879, 882, "INGREDIENT"], [883, 886, "PROCESS"], [892, 897, "INGREDIENT"], [903, 912, "INGREDIENT"], [967, 980, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
