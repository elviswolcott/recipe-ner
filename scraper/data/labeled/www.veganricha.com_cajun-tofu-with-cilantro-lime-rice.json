["Ingredients:\n12 to 14 oz firm tofu\n1.5 to 2 tbsp cajun spice blend (, see note)\n1 tbsp lime juice\n2 tsp\u00c2\u00a0 olive oil\n1/4 to 1/2 tsp salt\n1 cup long grain rice or basmati rice\n1/2 tsp oil\n2 cups water\n1/2 tsp salt\n1 tbsp or more lime juice\n1/4 cup packed finely chopped cilantro\ncrunchy greens, chopped tomato or cucumber,  lime juice\n\nInstructions:\nPress the tofu (wrap in paper towel, then kitchen towel and place a couple of heavy books on it for 15 minutes or use a tofu press). Then slice into 1/4 inch thick slices. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.\nMix the cajun spices with lime juice, olive oil and salt to make a paste. Rub the cajun paste on the tofu and let it chill for at least 15 mins (to an hour) to pick up the flavor.  * See Note.. Alternatively, toss the tofu (in cubes form) in olive oil, then toss in dry cajun spice blend + salt. (Drizzle lime juice later after baking).&nbsp;\nBake the Tofu at 350 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes. &nbsp;Cool for a few minutes, then slice and serve.\nMeanwhile, make the cilantro lime rice: Wash and soak the rice for atleast 15 minutes. (I usually do this along with tofu pressing, so the rice and tofu are ready around the same time).&nbsp;\nDrain the rice and add to the saucepan. Add salt, water, and oil if using and mix in. You can also add in a bay leaf.\nReduce heat to medium-low and cook covered for 18 to 20 minutes. Fluff the rice, mix in lime juice and half the cilantro. Taste and adjust carefully. Cover and let sit for 2 minutes. Garnish with more cilantro when serving.&nbsp;\nAssemble crunchy greens or lettuce cilantro lime rice, sliced tofu, chopped tomato and a good drizzle of lime or lemon, salt and freshly ground pepper. Serve as a bowl or fill up warm tortillas for great tacos.&nbsp;", {"entities": [[19, 24, "QUANTITY"], [25, 34, "INGREDIENT"], [42, 48, "QUANTITY"], [49, 66, "INGREDIENT"], [80, 86, "QUANTITY"], [87, 97, "INGREDIENT"], [106, 115, "INGREDIENT"], [123, 130, "QUANTITY"], [131, 135, "INGREDIENT"], [136, 141, "QUANTITY"], [142, 173, "INGREDIENT"], [174, 181, "QUANTITY"], [182, 185, "INGREDIENT"], [186, 192, "QUANTITY"], [193, 198, "INGREDIENT"], [199, 206, "QUANTITY"], [207, 211, "INGREDIENT"], [212, 218, "QUANTITY"], [219, 237, "INGREDIENT"], [238, 245, "QUANTITY"], [246, 276, "INGREDIENT"], [293, 307, "INGREDIENT"], [322, 332, "INGREDIENT"], [358, 362, "INGREDIENT"], [364, 368, "PROCESS"], [408, 413, "PROCESS"], [468, 472, "INGREDIENT"], [473, 478, "PROCESS"], [581, 591, "INGREDIENT"], [593, 602, "INGREDIENT"], [607, 611, "INGREDIENT"], [622, 627, "INGREDIENT"], [643, 648, "INGREDIENT"], [656, 660, "INGREDIENT"], [773, 777, "INGREDIENT"], [797, 806, "INGREDIENT"], [825, 842, "INGREDIENT"], [845, 850, "INGREDIENT"], [860, 870, "INGREDIENT"], [907, 911, "INGREDIENT"], [1021, 1029, "INGREDIENT"], [1035, 1039, "INGREDIENT"], [1059, 1063, "INGREDIENT"], [1118, 1122, "INGREDIENT"], [1123, 1131, "PROCESS"], [1140, 1144, "INGREDIENT"], [1149, 1153, "INGREDIENT"], [1203, 1207, "INGREDIENT"], [1212, 1215, "PROCESS"], [1237, 1241, "INGREDIENT"], [1243, 1248, "INGREDIENT"], [1254, 1257, "INGREDIENT"], [1271, 1274, "PROCESS"], [1283, 1286, "INGREDIENT"], [1292, 1295, "PROCESS"], [1341, 1345, "PROCESS"], [1386, 1390, "INGREDIENT"], [1392, 1395, "PROCESS"], [1399, 1409, "INGREDIENT"], [1423, 1431, "INGREDIENT"], [1512, 1520, "INGREDIENT"], [1576, 1584, "INGREDIENT"], [1590, 1594, "INGREDIENT"], [1603, 1607, "INGREDIENT"], [1609, 1623, "INGREDIENT"], [1661, 1665, "INGREDIENT"], [1678, 1684, "INGREDIENT"], [1685, 1691, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
