["Ingredients:\n1/2 cup (1 stick) vegan butter, slightly softened to room temperature*\n2 cups powdered sugar (+ more as needed)\n1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n4 tablespoons aquafaba (liquid from a can of chickpeas)\nOptional: vegan friendly food coloring, if desired\n\nInstructions:\nAdd the vegan butter to a large bowl of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment (or you can use an electric hand mixer.) Beat the butter until creamy and smooth.\nAdd the powdered sugar, 1/2 cup at a time so it doesn&#039;t jump out of the bowl, until all the powdered sugar is mixed in.\nNow add the vanilla and aquafaba to the bowl, and beat on medium-high speed for 5 minutes. Don&#039;t cut the time short, it really does take that long to get perfectly creamy and silky smooth. If after 5 minutes the frosting is not thick enough, add more powdered sugar, 1/2 cup at a time, until the frosting is thick, fluffy and creamy.\nIf adding color, mix in just a few drops of vegan friendly gel food coloring, or more until you have your desired color.\nUse Swiss Meringue Buttercream to frost cupcakes, cakes or in between cookies. The recipe makes enough for about 12 cupcakes or a double layer cake.", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [31, 82, "INGREDIENT"], [84, 90, "QUANTITY"], [91, 105, "INGREDIENT"], [125, 135, "QUANTITY"], [136, 156, "INGREDIENT"], [157, 170, "QUANTITY"], [171, 179, "INGREDIENT"], [195, 211, "INGREDIENT"], [287, 299, "INGREDIENT"], [342, 347, "PROCESS"], [367, 370, "INGREDIENT"], [409, 415, "INGREDIENT"], [449, 463, "INGREDIENT"], [465, 472, "QUANTITY"], [538, 552, "INGREDIENT"], [556, 561, "PROCESS"], [570, 573, "PROCESS"], [578, 585, "INGREDIENT"], [590, 598, "INGREDIENT"], [813, 816, "PROCESS"], [822, 836, "INGREDIENT"], [838, 845, "QUANTITY"], [908, 914, "PROCESS"], [922, 925, "PROCESS"], [983, 990, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
