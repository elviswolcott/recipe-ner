["Ingredients:\n20 ounces shredded frozen hash browns\n1 package vegan bacon*  (see notes for options)\n1/4 cup diced onion\n1  red bell pepper, seeded and diced\n3 cups chopped baby spinach\n2 cups vegan shredded cheese, cheddar style (optional)\n(2) 12.3-ounce packages silken firm or extra-firm tofu\n1 cup white rice flour\n1/4 cup cornstarch\n1/2 cup nutritional yeast\n1/2 teaspoon turmeric\n1 teaspoon kala namak\n1 teaspoon salt\nfew shakes black pepper\n1 1/2 cups water\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat oven to 350 and lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking pan. Spread the frozen hash browns into the casserole dish and place in the oven to thaw while the oven preheats, about 10 minutes. Remove the hash browns once they are no longer frozen.\nChop your vegan bacon (or sausage/chorizo) into small pieces, then sprinkle on top of the hash browns, followed by the onion, red bell pepper, spinach and 1 cup of the vegan cheese, if using.\nDrain any water from the tofu packages. In a blender, add the tofu and the rest of the vegan &quot;egg&quot; ingredients and blend until smooth. Pour the &quot;eggs&quot; over the top of the casserole.\nSprinkle the remaining cup of cheese on top and bake, uncovered, for 55-60 minutes, until the &quot;eggs&quot; are firm. Serve with hot sauce, avocado slices and sprinkle with parsley, if desired. Enjoy!\nMake ahead: To prepare the casserole the night before, simply place the frozen hash browns in the casserole dish (no need to thaw). Continue with layering everything in the dish, then cover and place in the refrigerator overnight. In the morning, preheat the oven to 350, then bake uncovered for 65-75 minutes, until hot and the &quot;eggs&quot; are cooked.", {"entities": [[13, 22, "QUANTITY"], [23, 50, "INGREDIENT"], [99, 106, "QUANTITY"], [107, 118, "INGREDIENT"], [122, 137, "INGREDIENT"], [150, 155, "INGREDIENT"], [156, 162, "QUANTITY"], [163, 183, "INGREDIENT"], [184, 190, "QUANTITY"], [191, 227, "INGREDIENT"], [270, 293, "INGREDIENT"], [294, 299, "QUANTITY"], [300, 316, "INGREDIENT"], [317, 324, "QUANTITY"], [325, 335, "INGREDIENT"], [336, 343, "QUANTITY"], [344, 361, "INGREDIENT"], [362, 374, "QUANTITY"], [375, 383, "INGREDIENT"], [384, 394, "QUANTITY"], [395, 405, "INGREDIENT"], [406, 416, "QUANTITY"], [417, 421, "INGREDIENT"], [433, 445, "INGREDIENT"], [446, 456, "QUANTITY"], [457, 462, "INGREDIENT"], [529, 535, "PROCESS"], [552, 558, "INGREDIENT"], [599, 604, "PROCESS"], [715, 721, "INGREDIENT"], [790, 798, "PROCESS"], [842, 847, "INGREDIENT"], [849, 864, "INGREDIENT"], [866, 873, "INGREDIENT"], [878, 883, "QUANTITY"], [891, 903, "INGREDIENT"], [925, 930, "INGREDIENT"], [940, 944, "INGREDIENT"], [969, 972, "PROCESS"], [977, 981, "INGREDIENT"], [1140, 1143, "QUANTITY"], [1165, 1169, "PROCESS"], [1249, 1258, "INGREDIENT"], [1279, 1287, "PROCESS"], [1293, 1300, "INGREDIENT"], [1383, 1388, "PROCESS"], [1393, 1399, "INGREDIENT"], [1515, 1520, "PROCESS"], [1598, 1602, "PROCESS"], [1671, 1677, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
