["Ingredients:\n1 1/2 cups raw cashews\n3/4 cup water\n2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar\n1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice\n1/2 teaspoon salt\nOPTIONAL: 1 cup unsweetened non-dairy yogurt\n\nInstructions:\nQuick soak the cashews: Bring a few cups of\u00c2\u00a0water to a boil (I use my tea kettle for this). Add 1 1/2 cups cashews to a measuring cup and pour the boiling hot water on top to cover. Let them soak for 5 minutes, or 1 hour if you don&#x27;t have a high powered blender.\nDrain the cashews and add to high powered blender. Now add 3/4 cup fresh water, apple cider vinegar, lemon juice and salt. Blend until very smooth.\nPour the cashew mixture into a bowl and stir in in the unsweetened yogurt. This is optional, but it brings the sour cream to another level in terms of texture and flavor.\nUse immediately, or transfer to a small covered container and refrigerate. It will thicken up as it chills. The sour cream will keep for about a week. You may also freeze this if desired.
