["Ingredients:\n1  prebaked pie crust. I use a gf graham cracker style crust (, See notes for crust recipes and refined sugar free option)\n1 1/4 cup dairy-free yogurt ((such as kite hill almond plain yogurt, vanilla will work as well))\n1/2 cup smooth cashew butter ((almond or peanut butter can be used, peanut adds a stronger flavor))\n6 oz vegan cream cheese ((such as kite hill plain almond cream cheese))\n1 tsp vanilla extract\n2 - 3 tsp lime juice ((or lemon juice))\n2 tbsp cornstarch ((1.5 tbsp for a less set cheesecake))\n1/4 tsp salt\n11  soft dates (, pitted )\n2 - 3 tbsp coconut sugar ((or other sugar/sweetener))\noptional flavor additions: 1 tsp lime or lemon zest , a few drops of almond extract\n\nInstructions:\nPrep and par bake the crust of choice if you havent already. Preheat the oven to 350 deg F (180 C).\nBlend all the ingredients under cheesecake. Taste and adjust sweet and tang. The tang gets stronger with baking. Add a few tablespoons&nbsp;sugar if needed. Add 2-3 tablespoons water if needed for blending.&nbsp;\nPour into prepared crust and spread with a spatula to even it out.&nbsp;\nBake for 35 to 45 minutes(depends on the cream cheese brand, moisture content in the filling, choice of ingredients. The top should be set and center should not be liquid).&nbsp;Cool completely. Chill for 4 to 6 hours. Slice and serve with whipped coconut cream or vegan ice cream of choice with fresh berries or a berry compote.&nbsp;", {"entities": [[117, 122, "INGREDIENT"], [136, 145, "QUANTITY"], [146, 163, "INGREDIENT"], [191, 203, "INGREDIENT"], [205, 212, "INGREDIENT"], [233, 240, "QUANTITY"], [241, 261, "INGREDIENT"], [274, 287, "INGREDIENT"], [288, 291, "INGREDIENT"], [333, 337, "QUANTITY"], [338, 356, "INGREDIENT"], [390, 402, "INGREDIENT"], [405, 410, "QUANTITY"], [411, 426, "INGREDIENT"], [431, 436, "QUANTITY"], [437, 447, "INGREDIENT"], [453, 464, "INGREDIENT"], [467, 473, "QUANTITY"], [474, 484, "INGREDIENT"], [524, 531, "QUANTITY"], [532, 536, "INGREDIENT"], [546, 551, "INGREDIENT"], [568, 574, "QUANTITY"], [575, 588, "INGREDIENT"], [600, 605, "INGREDIENT"], [606, 615, "INGREDIENT"], [645, 650, "QUANTITY"], [651, 701, "INGREDIENT"], [730, 734, "PROCESS"], [922, 928, "PROCESS"], [980, 993, "QUANTITY"], [994, 999, "INGREDIENT"], [1144, 1156, "INGREDIENT"], [1343, 1364, "INGREDIENT"], [1374, 1377, "INGREDIENT"], [1399, 1404, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
