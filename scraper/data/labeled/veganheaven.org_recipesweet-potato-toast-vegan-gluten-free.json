["Ingredients:\n1  large sweet potato\ntoppings of your choice ((you can find many suggestions above in the text) )\n\nInstructions:\nVertically slice your sweet potatoes into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Don't make them too thick as they won't get cooked all through then.\nYou can either peel the sweet potatoes or just leave the skin on. I usually don't mind the skin, but that's totally up to you. It works both ways.\nTurn the toaster all the way up to high and toast the sweet potato slices for 2-3 rounds or about 5 minutes. Spread the sweet potato toasts with the toppings of your choice. You can find many suggestions in the text above.\nYou can keep extra slices in an air-tight container in the fridge for up to one week. Just heat them up again in the toaster.", {"entities": [[22, 34, "INGREDIENT"], [65, 68, "INGREDIENT"], [155, 163, "INGREDIENT"], [236, 242, "INGREDIENT"], [265, 268, "INGREDIENT"], [291, 299, "INGREDIENT"], [462, 474, "INGREDIENT"], [528, 540, "INGREDIENT"], [586, 589, "INGREDIENT"], [635, 638, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
