["Ingredients:\n2 1/4 cups all purpose flour\n1 tablespoon baking powder\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 cup granulated sugar\n1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n8 tablespoons cold vegan butter\n3/4 cup cold soy milk\n1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n1 cup peeled and diced fresh peaches\n1/2 cup candied ginger, chopped, optional\n1 cup powdered sugar\n2 tablespoons soy milk\n1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees F and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper (or spray pan with non-stick spray.)\nIn a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, sugar and cinnamon.\nAdd the cold vegan butter, and use a\u00c2\u00a0pastry cutter\u00c2\u00a0or your hands to work the butter into the dry ingredients. It should resemble coarse crumbs.\nPour in the milk and vanilla, and stir until just combined. It will still be a shaggy dough at this point. Fold in the diced peaches and candied ginger, if using, gently. The dough will become a bit wet; that&#39;s okay. Use your hands if needed to get the peaches and ginger incorporated the best you can.\nOn a lightly floured surface, knead the dough a few times until it comes together, gently. Flatten the dough with your hands (lightly flour your hands if sticky). Flatten it into a circle, about 1 inch thick.\nUsing a pizza cutter or large knife, cut it like you would a pizza, into 8 pieces.\nUsing a spatula, place the scones onto the prepared baking sheet and bake for 20-24 minutes, until lightly golden brown on top. Transfer to a wire cooling rack.\nWhile the scones are cooling, make the glaze. In a small bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, soy milk and vanilla until smooth.\nOnce the scones have cooled, drizzle with the glaze and serve.
