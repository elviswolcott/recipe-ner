["Ingredients:\n2 cups all-purpose flour\n1 cup cocoa powder\n3/4 cup brown sugar\n2 tablespoons baking powder\n1 teaspoon natural vanilla extract\n1 cup almond milk\n3/4 cup unsweetened apple sauce\n1/2 cup canola oil\n2  avocado\n1/2 cup cocoa powder\n1/4 cup agave or maple syrup\n1 tablespoon melted coconut oil\n1 teaspoon natural vanilla extract\nfresh berries (I used raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, and cherries)\npistachios\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat your oven to 350 F. In a large bowl, combine all dry ingredients (flour, brown sugar, baking powder, and cocoa powder). Stir well with a wooden spoon.\nAdd the wet ingredients (oil, almond milk, unsweetened apple sauce, vanilla extract).\u00c2\u00a0\nStir well with a wooden spoon until you&#039;ve got a smooth batter.\u00c2\u00a0\nLightly grease a 10 inch springform pan with vegan butter or margarine.\u00c2\u00a0\nPour the batter into the springform pan. Bake at 350 F for 30 minutes. It&#039;s best to test with a skewer to see if the cake is done or if you need to adjust the baking time a little bit as every oven is a bit different. Remove from the oven and allow to cool down for about 30 minutes.\nMake the vegan chocolate frosting. In a food processor combine all ingredients and blend until smooth. Evenly spread the avocado chocolate frosting on the chocolate cake. Sprinkle with pistachios and top with fresh berries.
