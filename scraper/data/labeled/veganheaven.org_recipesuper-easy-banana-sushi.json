On hot summer days, put them in the freezer for a few minutes.\nCut them into bite-sized sushi pieces with a sharp knife. You can either eat the banana sushi right away or freeze it for an hour and two and enjoy it as easy vegan ice cream bites.", {"entities": [[24, 37, "QUANTITY"], [38, 51, "INGREDIENT"], [60, 85, "INGREDIENT"], [99, 127, "INGREDIENT"], [128, 141, "QUANTITY"], [142, 160, "INGREDIENT"], [161, 174, "QUANTITY"], [175, 187, "INGREDIENT"], [188, 200, "QUANTITY"], [201, 211, "INGREDIENT"], [267, 280, "INGREDIENT"], [291, 300, "INGREDIENT"], [333, 338, "PROCESS"], [406, 411, "INGREDIENT"], [448, 457, "INGREDIENT"], [462, 470, "PROCESS"], [515, 524, "INGREDIENT"], [761, 764, "INGREDIENT"], [864, 867, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
