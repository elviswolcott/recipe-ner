If not add a bit more olive oil. If too crumbly (if using almond meal) you might need to add a tsp or so regular flour. **Transfer the mix to a bowl and refrigerate for 15 minutes. Remove the bowl from the refrigerator and press and roll into balls. Place the balls on parchment baking sheet and bake at 300F(150 c) for 12 minutes.\nAfter baking, let them cool completely and store in the refrigerator up to 2 weeks.", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 36, "INGREDIENT"], [53, 59, "INGREDIENT"], [63, 72, "INGREDIENT"], [74, 81, "QUANTITY"], [82, 94, "INGREDIENT"], [95, 100, "QUANTITY"], [101, 112, "INGREDIENT"], [113, 120, "QUANTITY"], [121, 128, "INGREDIENT"], [129, 136, "QUANTITY"], [137, 150, "INGREDIENT"], [151, 158, "QUANTITY"], [159, 163, "INGREDIENT"], [164, 171, "QUANTITY"], [172, 185, "INGREDIENT"], [186, 193, "QUANTITY"], [194, 206, "INGREDIENT"], [209, 214, "QUANTITY"], [215, 232, "INGREDIENT"], [233, 239, "QUANTITY"], [240, 262, "INGREDIENT"], [311, 326, "INGREDIENT"], [331, 343, "INGREDIENT"], [395, 403, "INGREDIENT"], [577, 582, "PROCESS"], [596, 599, "PROCESS"], [611, 620, "INGREDIENT"], [647, 658, "INGREDIENT"], [678, 681, "PROCESS"], [688, 693, "INGREDIENT"], [694, 707, "INGREDIENT"], [724, 727, "PROCESS"], [812, 817, "PROCESS"], [868, 874, "PROCESS"], [885, 889, "PROCESS"], [927, 933, "PROCESS"]]}]
