I did not use color)\nOil for frying\n\nInstructions:\nTo prepare the sugar syrup, Boil all the ingredients till the syrup comes to a boil and thickens a bit. (2-3 minutes after the syrup boils). You can add other flavors to the syrup like kewra essence or rose water/essence instead of cardamom.\nFor the Jalebi batter, In a bowl, add warm water, sugar, saffron and yeast and mix well.\nKeep the mixture for 10 minutes or until it is frothy.\nAdd in the flour, non dairy yogurt and mix well to make a smooth pouring consistency mixture without lumps.\nCover bowl with plastic wrap and keep for an hour.\nPour the mixture into a squeezy bottle or a zip-lock bag and cut a small hole(1/8 inch) on one side of the ziplock bag,\nHeat oil in a kadhai or deep pan over medium heat until hot. Starting from the center, squeeze out the batter in circles to make a big concentric circle.\nFry it on medium high heat on both sides, till the Jalebies turn golden brown. (*Authentic Jalebis are meant to be fried in ghee(clarified butter), like are you kidding me, 2 cups of ghee is probably from 100s of gallons of milk! )\nTransfer Jalebis to warm sugar syrup and remove after half a minute.\nServe warm or cold as is or topped with Vegan Rabdi!", {"entities": [[13, 18, "QUANTITY"], [19, 24, "INGREDIENT"], [25, 32, "QUANTITY"], [33, 38, "INGREDIENT"], [48, 63, "INGREDIENT"], [73, 88, "INGREDIENT"], [97, 102, "QUANTITY"], [103, 120, "INGREDIENT"], [132, 139, "QUANTITY"], [140, 155, "INGREDIENT"], [156, 168, "QUANTITY"], [169, 185, "INGREDIENT"], [186, 198, "QUANTITY"], [199, 215, "INGREDIENT"], [216, 227, "QUANTITY"], [228, 233, "INGREDIENT"], [243, 250, "INGREDIENT"], [310, 313, "INGREDIENT"], [318, 324, "PROCESS"], [355, 366, "INGREDIENT"], [419, 423, "PROCESS"], [485, 488, "INGREDIENT"], [489, 492, "PROCESS"], [542, 552, "INGREDIENT"], [572, 580, "INGREDIENT"], [616, 619, "PROCESS"], [620, 630, "INGREDIENT"], [632, 637, "INGREDIENT"], [639, 646, "INGREDIENT"], [651, 656, "INGREDIENT"], [661, 664, "PROCESS"], [737, 742, "INGREDIENT"], [744, 760, "INGREDIENT"], [765, 768, "PROCESS"], [858, 862, "PROCESS"], [1010, 1013, "INGREDIENT"], [1274, 1279, "PROCESS"], [1298, 1304, "INGREDIENT"], [1332, 1338, "QUANTITY"], [1383, 1387, "INGREDIENT"], [1416, 1427, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
