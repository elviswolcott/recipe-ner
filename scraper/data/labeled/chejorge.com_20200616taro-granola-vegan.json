["Ingredients:\n1 small -medium Okinawan (Purple) Sweet Potato\n3 lb. fresh taro\n1/2 cup Taro Paste\n3 tablespoons maple syrup\n2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n1.5 cups rolled oats\n1/4 cup raw almonds\n1/2 cup raw pecans\n1/4 cup raw walnuts\n\nInstructions:\nWrap the Purple Sweet Potato (whole, unpeeled) in aluminum foil and roast it in a 400 degrees F (204 C) oven for 50 minutes to an hour, or until tender to a parring knife. Once it's done, take it out and let cool.\nWash and peel the Taro. Roughly chop the taro into large cubes and cook them in boiling water until tender, around 25-30 minutes. Once it's done, pour out the water and let cool.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F (176 C). Mash the Purple Sweet Potato and the Taro with a fork and combine the two purees. Mix well.\nPrepare the dry ingredients by mixing rolled oats, almonds, pecans, and walnuts.\nPrepare the wet ingredients. In a small-medium sized pot, heat up the vegetable oil on low heat. Add the taro paste and maple syrup, and whisk to combine. Cook for one minute and set aside.\nThoroughlly combine the dry ingredients and the wet ingredients. Spread the mixture to a one-sheet thickness on a parchment-lined baking tray. Bake for 30-33 minutes total \u00e2\u20ac\u201d gently stir the granola at the half-way point (about 15 minutes in). A good way to tell when the granola is done is by feeling the middle \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the middle will be the last part to dry up / harden. After baking, let the granola cool for at least 15 minutes before packing it into a glass jar.", {"entities": [[53, 59, "INGREDIENT"], [66, 71, "INGREDIENT"], [77, 84, "QUANTITY"], [85, 95, "INGREDIENT"], [96, 109, "QUANTITY"], [110, 121, "INGREDIENT"], [122, 135, "QUANTITY"], [136, 149, "INGREDIENT"], [159, 170, "INGREDIENT"], [171, 178, "QUANTITY"], [179, 190, "INGREDIENT"], [191, 198, "QUANTITY"], [199, 209, "INGREDIENT"], [210, 217, "QUANTITY"], [218, 229, "INGREDIENT"], [267, 273, "INGREDIENT"], [313, 318, "PROCESS"], [526, 530, "PROCESS"], [539, 552, "INGREDIENT"], [618, 623, "INGREDIENT"], [703, 709, "INGREDIENT"], [804, 810, "PROCESS"], [811, 822, "INGREDIENT"], [824, 831, "INGREDIENT"], [833, 840, "INGREDIENT"], [845, 852, "INGREDIENT"], [924, 937, "INGREDIENT"], [964, 969, "INGREDIENT"], [974, 985, "INGREDIENT"], [991, 996, "PROCESS"], [1174, 1180, "PROCESS"], [1210, 1215, "INGREDIENT"], [1227, 1231, "PROCESS"], [1421, 1427, "PROCESS"]]}]
