["Ingredients:\n1 1/4 cup unsweetened soy milk\n1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar\n2 cups all purpose flour (see notes for substitutions)\n1 cup granulated sugar\n2 teaspoons baking powder\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n1 tablespoon cornstarch\n1/3 cup canola oil\n1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n1 1/2 cups fresh blueberries\n1-2 tablespoons coarse sugar, optional, for sprinkling the tops\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a standard muffin pan with liners and spray them lightly with oil.&nbsp;\nCombine the soy milk and apple cider vinegar in a measuring cup and set aside to curdle. This is your \"buttermilk\".\nIn a large mixing bowl, whisk together all the dry ingredients: flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and cornstarch.&nbsp;\nPour in the soy milk/vinegar mixture, canola oil and vanilla. Stir with a large spoon to combine, but do not over mix. Some small lumps are fine.\nFold in the blueberries, gently. Using a small measuring cup or ice cream scoop, add batter to the liners in the pan 3/4 of the way full. Top with a few extra blueberries and a sprinkle of coarse sugar, if desired.\nBake for 22-26 minutes, until golden brown on top and a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Let cool 5 minutes in the pan, then move to a cooling rack. Eat and enjoy!\nStore leftover muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for about 3 days. You can also freeze them by wrapping them in plastic wrap and placing them in a large freezer bag.", {"entities": [[13, 22, "QUANTITY"], [23, 43, "INGREDIENT"], [44, 54, "QUANTITY"], [55, 74, "INGREDIENT"], [75, 81, "QUANTITY"], [82, 99, "INGREDIENT"], [130, 135, "QUANTITY"], [136, 152, "INGREDIENT"], [153, 164, "QUANTITY"], [165, 178, "INGREDIENT"], [179, 191, "QUANTITY"], [192, 196, "INGREDIENT"], [197, 209, "QUANTITY"], [210, 220, "INGREDIENT"], [221, 228, "QUANTITY"], [229, 239, "INGREDIENT"], [240, 250, "QUANTITY"], [251, 271, "INGREDIENT"], [272, 282, "QUANTITY"], [283, 300, "INGREDIENT"], [303, 316, "QUANTITY"], [317, 364, "INGREDIENT"], [505, 513, "INGREDIENT"], [518, 537, "INGREDIENT"], [553, 556, "QUANTITY"], [620, 626, "PROCESS"], [633, 638, "PROCESS"], [673, 678, "INGREDIENT"], [680, 685, "INGREDIENT"], [687, 700, "INGREDIENT"], [702, 706, "INGREDIENT"], [741, 749, "INGREDIENT"], [750, 757, "INGREDIENT"], [767, 777, "INGREDIENT"], [782, 789, "INGREDIENT"], [843, 846, "PROCESS"], [887, 898, "INGREDIENT"], [932, 935, "QUANTITY"], [939, 942, "INGREDIENT"], [956, 959, "PROCESS"], [1034, 1045, "INGREDIENT"], [1052, 1060, "PROCESS"], [1071, 1076, "INGREDIENT"], [1347, 1350, "INGREDIENT"], [1396, 1400, "PROCESS"]]}]
