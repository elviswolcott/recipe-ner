Also if you handle the mixture too much, the lentils would start to break down.\nSpoon the lentil mixture into the scooped out butternut squash. sprinkle a little bit of salt and pepper, and bake at 400 degrees F for 10 minutes, or broil for 1-2 minutes.\nRemove from the oven and serve as is, or serve with a drizzle of lemon juice, or a side of gravy .
