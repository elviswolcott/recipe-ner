["Ingredients:\n2 1/2 cups all purpose flour\n3/4 cup granulated sugar\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1 cup coconut oil, softened (but not melted)\n13 ounces (about 1 1/4 cups) raspberry preserves\n1/2 cup powdered sugar\n2 tablespoons almond milk\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Line the bottom and sides of a 9 x 13 inch baking pan with parchment paper, leaving some overhang on the sides for easy removal.\nIn a large bowl, combine flour, sugar and salt. Now add the softened coconut oil, and stir until everything is well combined. The mixture should be rather crumbly. Use your hands if you need to.\nSet aside 1 cup of the shortbread dough, in a smaller bowl. This is your crumble topping.\nPress the mixture evenly into the baking pan. Bake for 15 minutes.\nRemove from the oven and turn the oven up to 350 degrees F.\nSpread the raspberry preserves over the warm crust. Sprinkle on the topping. Place in the oven and bake for 40 minutes. The filling should be bubbling on the edges.\nAllow the bars to cool in the pan for 20 minutes, and then move them to the refrigerator to cool for at least 2 hours. Lift the bars out using the parchment paper, cut into squares and drizzle with optional glaze.", {"entities": [[13, 23, "QUANTITY"], [24, 41, "INGREDIENT"], [42, 49, "QUANTITY"], [50, 66, "INGREDIENT"], [67, 79, "QUANTITY"], [80, 84, "INGREDIENT"], [85, 90, "QUANTITY"], [91, 112, "INGREDIENT"], [130, 139, "QUANTITY"], [147, 157, "QUANTITY"], [159, 178, "INGREDIENT"], [179, 186, "QUANTITY"], [187, 201, "INGREDIENT"], [202, 215, "QUANTITY"], [216, 227, "INGREDIENT"], [321, 327, "PROCESS"], [432, 437, "INGREDIENT"], [439, 444, "INGREDIENT"], [449, 454, "INGREDIENT"], [459, 462, "PROCESS"], [476, 487, "INGREDIENT"], [493, 497, "PROCESS"], [612, 617, "QUANTITY"], [726, 732, "PROCESS"], [830, 849, "INGREDIENT"], [918, 922, "PROCESS"]]}]
