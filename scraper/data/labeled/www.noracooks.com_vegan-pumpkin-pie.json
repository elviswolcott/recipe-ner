["Ingredients:\n1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree\n1 cup coconut cream*\n1 cup brown sugar\n1 teaspoon cinnamon\n1 teaspoon ginger\n1/2 teaspoon nutmeg\n1/8 teaspoon cloves\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n3 tablespoons cornstarch\n1 recipe Easy Vegan Pie Crust ((SEE NOTES FOR MORE OPTIONS))\nVegan Whipped Cream (optional, for serving)\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F.\u00c2\u00a0Prepare a pie crust in a pie plate.\nAdd the canned pumpkin, coconut cream, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, salt and cornstarch to a blender and blend until very smooth. You may also simply whisk it together in a bowl until smooth.\nPour the mixture into a 9-inch pan lined with a pie crust. May use a vegan store bought vegan pie crust, my Easy Vegan Pie Crust, or this Gluten Free Pie Crust. I don&#x27;t pre-cook the pie crust. Spread the mixture evenly with a spatula.\nBake for 1 hour. If the crust starts to burn, cover the edges of the crust with aluminum foil or a pie shield after about 30 minutes of baking. The middle will still look jiggly; that&#039;s normal. Let cool at room temperature for 30 minutes, then cover and transfer to the refrigerator to chill for at least 4 hours or overnight.\nSlice and serve with Vegan Whipped Cream or store bought non-dairy whipped topping, if desired. Enjoy!\nFor the Pie Crust Leaves: These are totally optional for decoration. Make or buy an extra pie crust, and roll out the dough about 1/8th inch thick. Using leaf cookie cutters, cut into shapes. Place on a baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes at 350 degrees F.", {"entities": [[16, 24, "QUANTITY"], [26, 43, "INGREDIENT"], [44, 49, "QUANTITY"], [50, 64, "INGREDIENT"], [65, 70, "QUANTITY"], [71, 82, "INGREDIENT"], [83, 93, "QUANTITY"], [94, 102, "INGREDIENT"], [103, 113, "QUANTITY"], [114, 120, "INGREDIENT"], [121, 133, "QUANTITY"], [134, 140, "INGREDIENT"], [141, 153, "QUANTITY"], [154, 160, "INGREDIENT"], [161, 173, "QUANTITY"], [174, 178, "INGREDIENT"], [179, 192, "QUANTITY"], [193, 203, "INGREDIENT"], [404, 418, "INGREDIENT"], [420, 433, "INGREDIENT"], [435, 446, "INGREDIENT"], [448, 456, "INGREDIENT"], [458, 464, "INGREDIENT"], [466, 472, "INGREDIENT"], [474, 480, "INGREDIENT"], [482, 486, "INGREDIENT"], [491, 501, "INGREDIENT"], [564, 569, "PROCESS"], [681, 693, "INGREDIENT"], [784, 788, "PROCESS"], [982, 988, "PROCESS"], [1222, 1234, "INGREDIENT"], [1484, 1490, "PROCESS"], [1501, 1505, "PROCESS"]]}]
