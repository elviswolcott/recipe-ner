["Ingredients:\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n1/2  onion, diced\n(2) 20-ounce  cans young green jackfruit in water or brine\n1/2 cup water\n1 tablespoon tomato paste\n2 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n2 tablespoons brown sugar\n2 teaspoons cumin\n1 teaspoon oregano\n1 teaspoon smoked paprika\n1 teaspoon garlic powder\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/4 cup fresh squeezed orange juice\n1 tablespoon fresh lime juice\n1 teaspoon liquid smoke\nFor serving: tortillas, guacamole, diced red onion, lime wedges, cilantro and sliced jalapenos\n\nInstructions:\nDrain and rinse the jackfruit from the can. Rinse very well if your jackfruit was packed in brine. Chop off the hard center core portions, if desired. I like the texture better with the tougher parts removed.\nHeat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat, then add the onion and cook for 3-4 minutes until translucent. Now add the jackfruit and 1/2 cup of water, cover and simmer for about 10 minutes to soften the jackfruit.\nWhile the jackfruit simmers, make the wet spice mix by stirring all the ingredients together in a small bowl. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F at this time and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.\nAfter 10 minutes, remove the lid and mash the jackfruit with a potato masher or two forks, to create a shredded texture. Add the wet spice mix and stir into mashed jackfruit, and cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently.\nNow add in the orange juice, lime juice and liquid smoke and simmer on low heat for about 10 minutes.\nSpread the jackfruit onto the prepared pan, evenly, and bake for 15-25 minutes, until it&#x27;s golden, crispy and even a bit blackened in some spots.\nRemove from the oven and serve warm in tortillas, burritos, bowls or wherever you desire with guacamole, diced red onion, sliced jalapenos and cilantro.", {"entities": [[13, 25, "QUANTITY"], [26, 35, "INGREDIENT"], [41, 46, "INGREDIENT"], [48, 53, "INGREDIENT"], [85, 94, "INGREDIENT"], [98, 103, "INGREDIENT"], [107, 112, "INGREDIENT"], [113, 120, "QUANTITY"], [121, 126, "INGREDIENT"], [127, 139, "QUANTITY"], [140, 152, "INGREDIENT"], [153, 166, "QUANTITY"], [167, 187, "INGREDIENT"], [188, 201, "QUANTITY"], [202, 211, "INGREDIENT"], [212, 225, "QUANTITY"], [226, 237, "INGREDIENT"], [238, 249, "QUANTITY"], [250, 255, "INGREDIENT"], [256, 266, "QUANTITY"], [267, 274, "INGREDIENT"], [275, 285, "QUANTITY"], [286, 300, "INGREDIENT"], [301, 311, "QUANTITY"], [312, 325, "INGREDIENT"], [326, 338, "QUANTITY"], [339, 343, "INGREDIENT"], [344, 351, "QUANTITY"], [352, 379, "INGREDIENT"], [380, 392, "QUANTITY"], [393, 409, "INGREDIENT"], [410, 420, "QUANTITY"], [421, 433, "INGREDIENT"], [458, 467, "INGREDIENT"], [469, 484, "INGREDIENT"], [499, 507, "INGREDIENT"], [564, 573, "INGREDIENT"], [583, 586, "INGREDIENT"], [612, 621, "INGREDIENT"], [626, 632, "INGREDIENT"], [636, 641, "INGREDIENT"], [762, 771, "INGREDIENT"], [814, 817, "PROCESS"], [822, 827, "INGREDIENT"], [832, 836, "PROCESS"], [876, 879, "PROCESS"], [884, 893, "INGREDIENT"], [898, 905, "QUANTITY"], [906, 914, "INGREDIENT"], [968, 977, "INGREDIENT"], [989, 998, "INGREDIENT"], [1021, 1026, "INGREDIENT"], [1027, 1030, "PROCESS"], [1034, 1042, "PROCESS"], [1153, 1159, "PROCESS"], [1234, 1243, "INGREDIENT"], [1251, 1257, "INGREDIENT"], [1291, 1299, "INGREDIENT"], [1321, 1326, "INGREDIENT"], [1327, 1330, "PROCESS"], [1335, 1339, "PROCESS"], [1345, 1351, "INGREDIENT"], [1352, 1361, "INGREDIENT"], [1367, 1371, "PROCESS"], [1387, 1395, "PROCESS"], [1412, 1415, "PROCESS"], [1423, 1435, "INGREDIENT"], [1437, 1447, "INGREDIENT"], [1452, 1464, "INGREDIENT"], [1521, 1530, "INGREDIENT"], [1566, 1570, "PROCESS"], [1755, 1764, "INGREDIENT"], [1766, 1771, "INGREDIENT"], [1772, 1789, "INGREDIENT"], [1804, 1812, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
