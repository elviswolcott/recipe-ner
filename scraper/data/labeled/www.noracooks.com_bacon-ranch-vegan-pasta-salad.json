Drain the excess marinade liquid, and over medium heat saute the tempeh crumbles for about 10 minutes, stirring frequently, until they are golden brown. Remove from heat.\nIn a large bowl, stir together the pasta and ranch dressing. Now, toss with the tempeh crumbles, tomatoes, olives and carrots.\nServe immediately or store in a covered container until ready to serve. The pasta may suck up some of the dressing over time, simply add a little water and stir if that happens.", {"entities": [[13, 21, "QUANTITY"], [22, 38, "INGREDIENT"], [47, 53, "INGREDIENT"], [55, 60, "INGREDIENT"], [68, 73, "QUANTITY"], [75, 82, "QUANTITY"], [83, 106, "INGREDIENT"], [107, 112, "QUANTITY"], [113, 129, "INGREDIENT"], [163, 167, "INGREDIENT"], [180, 187, "QUANTITY"], [188, 202, "INGREDIENT"], [203, 210, "QUANTITY"], [211, 220, "INGREDIENT"], [221, 228, "QUANTITY"], [229, 248, "INGREDIENT"], [249, 261, "QUANTITY"], [262, 278, "INGREDIENT"], [279, 291, "QUANTITY"], [292, 304, "INGREDIENT"], [305, 316, "QUANTITY"], [317, 329, "INGREDIENT"], [353, 359, "INGREDIENT"], [390, 395, "PROCESS"], [409, 419, "INGREDIENT"], [420, 439, "INGREDIENT"], [441, 452, "INGREDIENT"], [454, 459, "INGREDIENT"], [464, 476, "INGREDIENT"], [493, 499, "INGREDIENT"], [529, 534, "PROCESS"], [655, 665, "INGREDIENT"], [757, 767, "INGREDIENT"], [773, 777, "PROCESS"], [845, 851, "INGREDIENT"], [868, 874, "INGREDIENT"], [907, 910, "PROCESS"], [927, 936, "INGREDIENT"], [949, 952, "INGREDIENT"], [1015, 1020, "PROCESS"], [1025, 1031, "INGREDIENT"], [1063, 1071, "PROCESS"], [1148, 1152, "PROCESS"], [1166, 1171, "INGREDIENT"], [1211, 1217, "INGREDIENT"], [1228, 1236, "INGREDIENT"], [1249, 1256, "INGREDIENT"], [1334, 1339, "INGREDIENT"], [1391, 1394, "PROCESS"], [1404, 1409, "INGREDIENT"], [1414, 1418, "PROCESS"]]}]
