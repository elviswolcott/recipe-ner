["Ingredients:\n1/2 cup unsweetened soy milk\n2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar\n3/4 cup all purpose flour\n3/4 cup sugar\n1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder\n1 teaspoon baking powder\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/3 cup canola oil\n1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce\n2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract\n1 Recipe Vegan Chocolate Frosting\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners. Spray the liners with a little oil to prevent sticking.\nIn a measuring cup, combine the soy milk and apple cider vinegar. Let sit a few minutes until it curdles (this is your vegan buttermilk).\nIn a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt until well combined.\nTo the bowl with the mixed dry ingredients, add the oil, applesauce, vanilla and milk/vinegar mixture. Stir well with a large spoon or spatula until smooth and well combined. The batter should be fairly thin and smooth, not too thick. (see photos in post above for reference)\nFill the liners only half full. Do not overfill or the cupcakes will rise out of the liners and spill over. Bake for 18-22 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out mostly clean.\nCool completely, then pipe or spread on frosting as desired with Vegan Chocolate Frosting.", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 41, "INGREDIENT"], [42, 53, "QUANTITY"], [54, 73, "INGREDIENT"], [74, 81, "QUANTITY"], [82, 99, "INGREDIENT"], [100, 107, "QUANTITY"], [108, 113, "INGREDIENT"], [114, 121, "QUANTITY"], [122, 146, "INGREDIENT"], [147, 157, "QUANTITY"], [158, 171, "INGREDIENT"], [172, 184, "QUANTITY"], [185, 196, "INGREDIENT"], [197, 209, "QUANTITY"], [210, 214, "INGREDIENT"], [215, 222, "QUANTITY"], [223, 233, "INGREDIENT"], [234, 241, "QUANTITY"], [242, 264, "INGREDIENT"], [265, 276, "QUANTITY"], [277, 297, "INGREDIENT"], [313, 322, "INGREDIENT"], [395, 398, "QUANTITY"], [460, 463, "INGREDIENT"], [500, 503, "QUANTITY"], [517, 525, "INGREDIENT"], [530, 549, "INGREDIENT"], [634, 640, "PROCESS"], [647, 652, "PROCESS"], [666, 671, "INGREDIENT"], [673, 678, "INGREDIENT"], [680, 692, "INGREDIENT"], [694, 707, "INGREDIENT"], [709, 720, "INGREDIENT"], [725, 729, "INGREDIENT"], [772, 777, "PROCESS"], [795, 798, "PROCESS"], [803, 806, "INGREDIENT"], [808, 818, "INGREDIENT"], [820, 827, "INGREDIENT"], [832, 836, "INGREDIENT"], [837, 844, "INGREDIENT"], [954, 958, "PROCESS"], [1284, 1293, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
