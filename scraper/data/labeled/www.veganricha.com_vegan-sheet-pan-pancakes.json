["Ingredients:\n2 cups flour (I usually use 1 1/2 cup all-purpose and 1/2 cup whole wheat or whole wheat pastry flour, all all purpose works as well)\n2  tablespoons cornstarch or tapioca starch\n1 tablespoon flaxseed meal\n3 tablespoons sugar\n1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder\n1/4 teaspoon baking soda\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/4 teaspoon cinnamon (or other spices of choice )\n2 teaspoons white or apple cider vinegar\n1 1/2 cup non-dairy milk (I like to use a mix of coconut milk and oatmilk)\n1/2-1 teaspoon vanilla extract\na few drops of almond extract optional\n3 tablespoons oil\n1/4 cup club soda (or use more milk)\ntoppings of choice such as berries (chocolate chips, banana, or a cinnamon sugar swirl)\n\nInstructions:\nIn a bowl, combine all the dry ingredients: that&#39;s the flour, cornstarch, flax meal, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon or other spices that you plan to use. Mix really well.\nThen in another bowl, mix in the vinegar into the non-dairy milk and let it sit for a few minutes. Add that buttermilk mixture to the dry. Add the oil and vanilla and mix in lightly.\nThen add in a 1/4 cup of club soda and mix until the mixture is a smooth batter. If the batter is too stiff, add another tablespoon of club soda.\nPrepare a 10x15 inch or larger baking sheet by either greasing really well or lining with parchment. Drop the batter into the baking sheet and spread it out evenly with a spatula.\nTop it with toppings of choice then bake at a preheated 425 degrees F (220 c) oven for 15 minutes . Take the baking sheet out of the oven at the 15-minute mark.\nLet it sit for 5 minutes to cool then if you lined it with parchment, you can slide the pancake off of the baking sheet. If not then slice within the baking sheet or use cookie cutters to make favorite shaped. Serve with some maple syrup and vegan butter.\nFor the cinnamon swirl: mix 1 tsp cinnamon with 2 tsp maple syrup and 1 tsp oil (optional) then drop using a spoon. Swirl the cinnamon syrup using a knife or toothpick", {"entities": [[13, 19, "QUANTITY"], [20, 25, "INGREDIENT"], [41, 50, "QUANTITY"], [67, 74, "QUANTITY"], [75, 86, "INGREDIENT"], [90, 114, "INGREDIENT"], [147, 161, "QUANTITY"], [162, 190, "INGREDIENT"], [191, 203, "QUANTITY"], [204, 217, "INGREDIENT"], [218, 231, "QUANTITY"], [232, 237, "INGREDIENT"], [238, 253, "QUANTITY"], [254, 267, "INGREDIENT"], [268, 280, "QUANTITY"], [281, 292, "INGREDIENT"], [293, 305, "QUANTITY"], [306, 310, "INGREDIENT"], [311, 323, "QUANTITY"], [324, 332, "INGREDIENT"], [343, 359, "INGREDIENT"], [362, 373, "QUANTITY"], [374, 402, "INGREDIENT"], [403, 412, "QUANTITY"], [413, 427, "INGREDIENT"], [445, 448, "PROCESS"], [449, 464, "INGREDIENT"], [482, 492, "QUANTITY"], [493, 508, "INGREDIENT"], [524, 538, "INGREDIENT"], [548, 561, "QUANTITY"], [562, 565, "INGREDIENT"], [566, 573, "QUANTITY"], [574, 583, "INGREDIENT"], [597, 601, "INGREDIENT"], [639, 654, "INGREDIENT"], [669, 677, "INGREDIENT"], [678, 683, "INGREDIENT"], [765, 770, "INGREDIENT"], [772, 782, "INGREDIENT"], [784, 793, "INGREDIENT"], [795, 800, "INGREDIENT"], [802, 815, "INGREDIENT"], [817, 828, "INGREDIENT"], [830, 834, "INGREDIENT"], [840, 864, "INGREDIENT"], [926, 929, "PROCESS"], [937, 944, "INGREDIENT"], [954, 968, "INGREDIENT"], [1051, 1054, "INGREDIENT"], [1059, 1066, "INGREDIENT"], [1071, 1074, "PROCESS"], [1092, 1095, "PROCESS"], [1101, 1108, "QUANTITY"], [1112, 1121, "INGREDIENT"], [1126, 1129, "PROCESS"], [1196, 1199, "PROCESS"], [1222, 1231, "INGREDIENT"], [1264, 1270, "PROCESS"], [1359, 1365, "PROCESS"], [1449, 1453, "PROCESS"], [1522, 1528, "PROCESS"], [1648, 1651, "INGREDIENT"], [1681, 1687, "PROCESS"], [1724, 1730, "PROCESS"], [1800, 1811, "INGREDIENT"], [1816, 1828, "INGREDIENT"], [1838, 1846, "INGREDIENT"], [1854, 1857, "PROCESS"], [1858, 1863, "QUANTITY"], [1864, 1872, "INGREDIENT"], [1878, 1883, "QUANTITY"], [1884, 1895, "INGREDIENT"], [1900, 1905, "QUANTITY"], [1906, 1909, "INGREDIENT"], [1956, 1964, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
