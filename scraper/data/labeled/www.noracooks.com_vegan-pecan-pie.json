["Ingredients:\n1  Vegan Pie Crust (*see Notes for other options)\n2 tablespoons ground flaxseeds\n4 tablespoons  water\n4 tablespoons vegan butter, melted\n3/4 cup dark corn syrup (*or maple syrup/brown rice syrup)\n3/4 cup granulated sugar\n3 tablespoons cornstarch\n2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract\n2 tablespoons bourbon, optional\n2 cups coarse chopped pecans (10 oz), + more halves for decorating\n\nInstructions:\nPrepare a vegan pie crust (there is no need to pre-bake it) and line a pie plate with it. Stick the pie plate with the crust in the refrigerator until ready to fill it. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.\nPrepare the flax eggs: In a small bowl, stir together the ground flaxseeds and water, then set aside to let thicken. This is your egg substitute.\nIn a large bowl, add the melted vegan butter, corn syrup, flax eggs, sugar, cornstarch, vanilla and optional bourbon and whisk until well combined and smooth.\nRoughly chop the pecans, but leave some whole if desired for decorating the top of the pie.\nCarefully spread the\u00c2\u00a0pecans\u00c2\u00a0evenly into the unbaked pie crust. Pour the sugar mixture into the pie crust over the pecans, evenly.\nBake the pie for 60-65 minutes, until thick and bubbly and dark brown. It will still be quite liquidity until it cools so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cut into it right away. Use a pie crust shield after 15-20 minutes of\u00c2\u00a0baking\u00c2\u00a0if the crust starts to burn.\nRemove from oven, sprinkle\u00c2\u00a0with coarse salt, if desired, and let cool on a wire rack. Let the pie cool at room temperature for 30 minutes at room temperature, then move it to the refrigerator to chill for at least 3 hours. Overnight is even better.\nSlice and serve the pie with coconut whipped cream, if desired.
