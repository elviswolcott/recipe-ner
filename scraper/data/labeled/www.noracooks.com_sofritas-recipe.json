["Ingredients:\n16 ounce block extra-firm tofu\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n1 tablespoon cornstarch\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n1  chipotle pepper in adobo\n2 tablespoons adobo sauce\n3 cloves garlic\n1.5 tablespoon lemon juice\n2 tablespoons tomato paste\n2 teaspoons granulated sugar\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2-3/4 cup water, divided\n\nInstructions:\nPress the tofu:\u00c2\u00a0Wrap the block of tofu in paper towels. Place a plate or pan on top of the wrapped tofu, and put a couple of heavy books on top of that. Let the tofu press for 20 minutes. (You can skip this step if you get the super firm variety)\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nSlice the tofu into about 6 slices. Now, rip each slice into medium-large pieces. You can also simply cut them into cubes, if you prefer, but ripping gives the tofu a great texture.\nAdd the tofu pieces to a large ziplock bag, along with the olive oil, cornstarch and salt. Close the bag, and shake gently to coat. Arrange the tofu evenly on the prepared pan, and bake for 25 minutes.\nWhile the tofu bakes, make the sauce: To a food processor (or blender), add the chipotle pepper, adobo sauce, garlic, lemon juice, tomato paste, sugar, salt and 1/4 cup water. Blend until smooth and set aside.\nWhen the tofu is done baking, chop it up into small pieces with a large knife. Set aside.\nAdd the sauce to a large pan and simmer for 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly. Now add the chopped tofu to the pan and stir to coat. Pour in another 1/4-1/2 cup of water to make it a little saucy, like Chipotles is.\nServe in burrito bowls, burritos, tacos or salads as desired.
