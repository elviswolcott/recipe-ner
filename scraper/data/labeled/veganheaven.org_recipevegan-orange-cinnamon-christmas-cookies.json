["Ingredients:\n3/4 cup powdered brown sugar\n2 cups ground almonds\n1 3/4 cup ground hazelnuts\n1 tablespoon orange juice\n2 tablespoons cinnamon\n1/2 cup water\n3/4 cup oat flour or whole wheat flour (Use oat flour to make the cookies gluten-free!)\n1/2 cup powdered brown sugar\nabout 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons water or plant-based milk\n1/2 teaspoon cinnamon\n\nInstructions:\nFirst make the powdered brown sugar: Put the brown sugar (3/4 cup) in a blender and pulse for about 30-60 seconds until the sugar is powdered.\nIf using oat flour do the same with the oats. Store-bought oat flour can be ridiculously expensive, but it's super easy to make at home and so much cheaper. Just place 3/4 cup of rolled oats in a food processor and pulse them until they have acquired a powder-like consistency.\nCombine all ingredients in a medium mixing bowl.\nOn a floured board or baking parchment, roll out the dough to about 0.4 inch (1 cm) thickness and cut it into star shapes using a cookie cutter.\nLine a baking tray with parchment paper and place the star-shaped cookies on top.\nPreheat the oven to 360 F (about 180 C) and bake for about 6-8 minutes. Make sure not to bake them too long, so they don't get hard. They're supposed to still be a bit soft.\nIn the meantime, make the icing: Combine all ingredients and stir until smooth. If it is too thin, add more powdered sugar. Let the cookies cool down and spread them evenly  using a knife or the back of a spoon. Sprinkle them with some more cinnamon.", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 41, "INGREDIENT"], [42, 48, "QUANTITY"], [49, 63, "INGREDIENT"], [64, 73, "QUANTITY"], [74, 90, "INGREDIENT"], [91, 103, "QUANTITY"], [104, 116, "INGREDIENT"], [117, 130, "QUANTITY"], [131, 139, "INGREDIENT"], [140, 147, "QUANTITY"], [148, 153, "INGREDIENT"], [154, 161, "QUANTITY"], [162, 192, "INGREDIENT"], [198, 207, "INGREDIENT"], [242, 249, "QUANTITY"], [250, 270, "INGREDIENT"], [282, 299, "QUANTITY"], [300, 325, "INGREDIENT"], [326, 338, "QUANTITY"], [339, 347, "INGREDIENT"], [378, 398, "INGREDIENT"], [408, 419, "INGREDIENT"], [421, 428, "QUANTITY"], [487, 492, "INGREDIENT"], [515, 524, "INGREDIENT"], [546, 550, "INGREDIENT"], [565, 574, "INGREDIENT"], [575, 578, "INGREDIENT"], [668, 673, "PROCESS"], [674, 681, "QUANTITY"], [682, 696, "INGREDIENT"], [820, 826, "PROCESS"], [855, 861, "PROCESS"], [985, 991, "PROCESS"], [1022, 1027, "PROCESS"], [1104, 1108, "PROCESS"], [1149, 1153, "PROCESS"], [1295, 1299, "PROCESS"], [1327, 1331, "PROCESS"], [1333, 1336, "PROCESS"], [1342, 1356, "INGREDIENT"], [1475, 1483, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
