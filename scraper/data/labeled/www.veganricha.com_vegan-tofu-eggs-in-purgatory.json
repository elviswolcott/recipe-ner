["Ingredients:\n2 tsp oil\n2 cloves garlic (minced)\n1/4 tsp pepper flakes\n1/8 tsp black pepper\n3  large Tomatoes (chopped or 1 15 oz can)\n2 tsp nutritional yeast\n1/4 tsp salt\n7 oz firm tofu (drained)\n1/2 cup water\n1/4 tsp salt\n1/4 tsp kala namak ((indian sulfur black salt))\n1 tsp corn starch\n1/2 tsp turmeric\n1/8 tsp paprika\n1/4 tsp kala namak (indian sulfur black salt)\n1 tsp cornstarch\nBlack Pepper or paprika\nFresh Green onion (or basil for garnish)\n\nInstructions:\nHeat a skillet over medium heat, add oil. Add in the garlic, pepper flakes, and black pepper, and cook until the garlic starts to turn golden on some edges.\nAdd in your tomatoes, salt, nutritional yeast, and mix well. Cover and cook until the tomatoes are tender. You will want to mash some of the larger pieces so that they are not raw.\nWhile the tomatoes are cooking, blend your tofu egg mixture in a blender by blending the 7 oz of tofu with the water, salt, pepper, kala namak, and cornstarch until smooth. Transfer this to a bowl, and transfer 1/3 of this creamy tofu mixture to another small bowl.\nAdd turmeric, paprika, kala namak, and starch to the bowl which has 1/3 of the mixture for the yolk . Mix well until well combined.\nMove the tomatoes aside so that there are holes in the mixture so that you can see the skillet, and this is where you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll add the eggs. Use a large spoon and spoon the white tofu egg mixture onto the tomatoes into these holes. Then use another spoon and add a dollop of the turmeric yolk mixture on top. Depending on your pan you will get 3 to 5 tofu eggs\nCover the skillet and cook for 3-4 minutes. Then switch off the heat, and let it sit for another 2-3 minutes.\nGarnish with green onions, and fresh herbs, and a good dash of black pepper over all of the dish, especially over the egg mixture. You can also add in some paprika on top, and serve over toasted bread. I also like to rub a raw garlic clove on the toasted bread, then butter it, and sprinkle it with some oregano.", {"entities": [[13, 18, "QUANTITY"], [19, 22, "INGREDIENT"], [25, 31, "INGREDIENT"], [32, 38, "INGREDIENT"], [40, 46, "INGREDIENT"], [48, 55, "QUANTITY"], [56, 69, "INGREDIENT"], [70, 77, "QUANTITY"], [78, 90, "INGREDIENT"], [110, 117, "INGREDIENT"], [121, 128, "QUANTITY"], [129, 132, "INGREDIENT"], [134, 139, "QUANTITY"], [140, 157, "INGREDIENT"], [158, 165, "QUANTITY"], [166, 170, "INGREDIENT"], [171, 175, "QUANTITY"], [176, 185, "INGREDIENT"], [196, 203, "QUANTITY"], [204, 209, "INGREDIENT"], [210, 217, "QUANTITY"], [218, 222, "INGREDIENT"], [223, 230, "QUANTITY"], [231, 241, "INGREDIENT"], [258, 268, "INGREDIENT"], [271, 276, "QUANTITY"], [277, 288, "INGREDIENT"], [289, 296, "QUANTITY"], [297, 305, "INGREDIENT"], [306, 313, "QUANTITY"], [314, 321, "INGREDIENT"], [322, 329, "QUANTITY"], [330, 340, "INGREDIENT"], [356, 366, "INGREDIENT"], [368, 373, "QUANTITY"], [374, 384, "INGREDIENT"], [401, 408, "INGREDIENT"], [415, 426, "INGREDIENT"], [431, 436, "INGREDIENT"], [498, 501, "PROCESS"], [502, 505, "INGREDIENT"], [518, 524, "INGREDIENT"], [526, 539, "INGREDIENT"], [545, 557, "INGREDIENT"], [563, 567, "PROCESS"], [578, 584, "INGREDIENT"], [634, 642, "INGREDIENT"], [644, 648, "INGREDIENT"], [650, 667, "INGREDIENT"], [673, 676, "PROCESS"], [693, 697, "PROCESS"], [708, 716, "INGREDIENT"], [813, 821, "INGREDIENT"], [826, 833, "PROCESS"], [846, 850, "INGREDIENT"], [892, 896, "QUANTITY"], [900, 904, "INGREDIENT"], [914, 919, "INGREDIENT"], [921, 925, "INGREDIENT"], [927, 933, "INGREDIENT"], [935, 945, "INGREDIENT"], [951, 961, "INGREDIENT"], [1033, 1037, "INGREDIENT"], [1073, 1081, "INGREDIENT"], [1083, 1090, "INGREDIENT"], [1092, 1102, "INGREDIENT"], [1108, 1114, "INGREDIENT"], [1210, 1218, "INGREDIENT"], [1276, 1279, "INGREDIENT"], [1324, 1327, "PROCESS"], [1376, 1380, "INGREDIENT"], [1402, 1410, "INGREDIENT"], [1456, 1459, "PROCESS"], [1476, 1484, "INGREDIENT"], [1548, 1552, "INGREDIENT"], [1580, 1584, "PROCESS"], [1681, 1693, "INGREDIENT"], [1699, 1704, "INGREDIENT"], [1705, 1710, "INGREDIENT"], [1728, 1743, "INGREDIENT"], [1803, 1806, "INGREDIENT"], [1812, 1815, "PROCESS"], [1824, 1831, "INGREDIENT"], [1895, 1901, "INGREDIENT"], [1935, 1941, "INGREDIENT"], [1950, 1958, "PROCESS"], [1972, 1979, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
