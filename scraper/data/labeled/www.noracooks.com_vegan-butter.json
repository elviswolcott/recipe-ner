["Ingredients:\n1/2 cup unsweetened soy milk\n2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar\n1 cup melted refined coconut oil  (*make sure to use REFINED, unrefined will taste like coconut)\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/4 cup canola oil  (*OR light tasting olive oil, avocado oil or other neutral flavored oil)\n1/4 cup coconut cream (*may omit, but it helps make the butter gloriously soft)\ntiny pinch turmeric, optional for color\n\nInstructions:\nGet out a medium sized bowl. Add the soy milk and apple cider vinegar, stir and let sit for 5 minutes until it curdles.\nWhile the milk/vinegar curdles, melt the coconut oil in the microwave (or stovetop) until warm, but not too hot. I microwave it in a glass measuring cup, so I can make sure I have exactly 1 cup of melted coconut oil.\nTo the bowl with the milk/vinegar mixture, add the melted coconut oil, salt, canola oil, coconut cream and optional tiny pinch of turmeric. Whisk well until smooth and pale in color. This will take less than 5 minutes. You could also place everything in a blender or food processor and blend until smooth.\nPour the mixture into glass containers or butter molds. If you use 1 large container, the butter will take longer to harden in the refrigerator, small molds will be ready faster. Place in the refrigerator for an hour or two to set.", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 41, "INGREDIENT"], [42, 53, "QUANTITY"], [54, 73, "INGREDIENT"], [74, 79, "QUANTITY"], [80, 106, "INGREDIENT"], [162, 169, "INGREDIENT"], [171, 183, "QUANTITY"], [184, 188, "INGREDIENT"], [189, 196, "QUANTITY"], [197, 207, "INGREDIENT"], [228, 237, "INGREDIENT"], [239, 250, "INGREDIENT"], [260, 280, "INGREDIENT"], [282, 289, "QUANTITY"], [290, 303, "INGREDIENT"], [338, 344, "INGREDIENT"], [373, 401, "INGREDIENT"], [454, 462, "INGREDIENT"], [467, 486, "INGREDIENT"], [488, 492, "PROCESS"], [547, 551, "INGREDIENT"], [552, 559, "INGREDIENT"], [578, 589, "INGREDIENT"], [686, 689, "QUANTITY"], [696, 699, "INGREDIENT"], [725, 730, "QUANTITY"], [734, 752, "INGREDIENT"], [775, 779, "INGREDIENT"], [780, 787, "INGREDIENT"], [797, 800, "PROCESS"], [805, 823, "INGREDIENT"], [825, 829, "INGREDIENT"], [831, 841, "INGREDIENT"], [843, 856, "INGREDIENT"], [884, 892, "INGREDIENT"], [988, 993, "PROCESS"], [1102, 1108, "INGREDIENT"], [1150, 1156, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
