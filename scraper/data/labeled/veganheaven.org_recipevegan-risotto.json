Let it soak for about 5 minutes. Slice the fresh button mushrooms.\u00c2\u00a0\nFinely chop the onion.\u00c2\u00a0\nDrain the dried mushrooms and keep the liquid you soaked them in for later. Roughly chop them.\u00c2\u00a0\nHeat some oil in a large pan and saut\u00c3\u00a9 the onion for about 2-3 minutes until it becomes translucent.\u00c2\u00a0\nAdd the mushrooms (fresh plus soaked) and the garlic and cook for 3 minutes on high heat. Add the rice and cook for another 2 minutes.\u00c2\u00a0\nDeglaze with white wine and allow the wine to evaporate. Once the wine has cooked into the rice, add the water you soaked the mushrooms in. Turn down the heat to a simmer and slowly keep adding the vegetable broth, allowing each amount to be absorbed before you add the next.
