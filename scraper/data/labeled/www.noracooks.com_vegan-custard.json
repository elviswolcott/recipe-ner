["Ingredients:\n3/4 cup unsweetened plant milk (soy, almond, cashew, etc)\n1/2 cup cornstarch\n1 can full fat coconut milk (13.5 oz)\n1/2 cup granulated sugar\n2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract\n4 tablespoons vegan butter\n\nInstructions:\nWhisk the plant milk and cornstarch in a measuring cup or bowl until smooth.\nTo a medium pot, add the coconut milk, sugar and milk/cornstarch mixture.\nTurn the heat to medium-high, and whisk until smooth. Bring to a simmer and continue whisking for about 5 minutes, until thickened.\nRemove from heat and stir in the vanilla and vegan butter, until the butter is melted and the mixture is smooth.\nPlace in a bowl with a layer of plastic wrap touching the top of the custard, to avoid a film forming. Place it in the refrigerator for a few hours to cool (you can speed this up by sticking it in the freezer for 30 minutes).\nOnce cool, if it is clumpy at all, use an immersion blender to smooth it out. You could also use a high powered blender, stand mixer with a whisk attachment or a. hand mixer to smooth it out. Use immediately anywhere you&#039;d like, or serve with a spoon and enjoy!", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 43, "INGREDIENT"], [71, 78, "QUANTITY"], [79, 89, "INGREDIENT"], [92, 117, "INGREDIENT"], [128, 135, "QUANTITY"], [136, 152, "INGREDIENT"], [153, 164, "QUANTITY"], [165, 185, "INGREDIENT"], [186, 199, "QUANTITY"], [200, 212, "INGREDIENT"], [238, 248, "INGREDIENT"], [253, 263, "INGREDIENT"], [279, 282, "QUANTITY"], [322, 325, "PROCESS"], [330, 342, "INGREDIENT"], [344, 349, "INGREDIENT"], [354, 358, "INGREDIENT"], [359, 369, "INGREDIENT"], [413, 418, "PROCESS"], [500, 509, "PROCESS"], [532, 536, "PROCESS"], [544, 551, "INGREDIENT"], [556, 568, "INGREDIENT"], [580, 586, "INGREDIENT"], [664, 668, "PROCESS"], [785, 788, "INGREDIENT"], [990, 995, "PROCESS"]]}]
