Use a few teaspoons more water or wheat flour if needed.\nThe glutenfree dough will be soft, more like a very thick batter and will get a bit dryer and more dough like after the 10 minutes.\nCover the doughs with a towel and let sit for 10 minutes till you prep the sugar syrup and heat up the oil.\nOil your hands and Make balls of the dough with a light hand. 1/2-3/4 inch size balls.\nOnce the oil is hot, fry the balls on medium heat. The wheat balls will double in size and the glutenfree ones will increase to 1.5 times the size, so fry in small batches to keep enough space and cook evenly. If the oil is too hot, the jamuns will get dark quickly Or crack open and not cook from the inside.Turn them around every 2 minutes.\nRemove the balls once golden brown all over, not dark brown.(6-8 minutes). Let the balls sit out for a minute before adding to the hot sugar syrup.\nPlace the balls in hot sugar syrup. keep the sugar syrup on low heat. Turn them around after 5 minutes and switch heat off. The balls soak unevenly for the first few minutes and look uneven too, but will even out after some time.\nLet them soak for at least half an hour. turn them around every 10 minutes. Serve warm or cold. Keep refrigerated for upto 3 days.", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 32, "INGREDIENT"], [37, 44, "QUANTITY"], [45, 50, "INGREDIENT"], [62, 74, "INGREDIENT"], [76, 89, "QUANTITY"], [90, 107, "INGREDIENT"], [120, 132, "QUANTITY"], [133, 142, "INGREDIENT"], [143, 155, "QUANTITY"], [156, 172, "INGREDIENT"], [173, 185, "QUANTITY"], [186, 199, "INGREDIENT"], [211, 224, "INGREDIENT"], [236, 246, "INGREDIENT"], [247, 257, "INGREDIENT"], [269, 276, "QUANTITY"], [277, 295, "INGREDIENT"], [302, 308, "INGREDIENT"], [309, 315, "PROCESS"], [316, 328, "INGREDIENT"], [338, 344, "INGREDIENT"], [346, 358, "QUANTITY"], [359, 362, "INGREDIENT"], [365, 378, "QUANTITY"], [379, 384, "INGREDIENT"], [385, 392, "QUANTITY"], [393, 402, "INGREDIENT"], [403, 416, "QUANTITY"], [417, 433, "INGREDIENT"], [434, 447, "QUANTITY"], [448, 462, "INGREDIENT"], [463, 475, "QUANTITY"], [476, 489, "INGREDIENT"], [492, 505, "INGREDIENT"], [506, 519, "QUANTITY"], [520, 538, "INGREDIENT"], [539, 549, "QUANTITY"], [550, 553, "INGREDIENT"], [554, 565, "QUANTITY"], [566, 571, "INGREDIENT"], [603, 620, "INGREDIENT"], [625, 630, "PROCESS"], [650, 659, "INGREDIENT"], [696, 701, "QUANTITY"], [702, 718, "INGREDIENT"], [730, 741, "INGREDIENT"], [743, 754, "INGREDIENT"], [757, 770, "INGREDIENT"], [771, 783, "QUANTITY"], [784, 801, "INGREDIENT"], [809, 817, "INGREDIENT"], [823, 828, "INGREDIENT"], [838, 850, "QUANTITY"], [851, 866, "INGREDIENT"], [942, 945, "PROCESS"], [1024, 1029, "INGREDIENT"], [1033, 1044, "INGREDIENT"], [1263, 1274, "INGREDIENT"], [1291, 1294, "INGREDIENT"], [1296, 1299, "INGREDIENT"], [1392, 1395, "INGREDIENT"], [1404, 1407, "PROCESS"], [1534, 1537, "PROCESS"], [1580, 1584, "PROCESS"], [1600, 1603, "INGREDIENT"], [1671, 1675, "PROCESS"], [1843, 1849, "PROCESS"], [1861, 1872, "INGREDIENT"], [1897, 1908, "INGREDIENT"], [1919, 1930, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
