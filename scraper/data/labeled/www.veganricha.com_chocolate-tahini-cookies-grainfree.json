["Ingredients:\n1/2 cup tahini (stirred)\n1/3 cup coconut sugar ( or other fine sugar of choice)\n1/2 tsp vanilla extract\n2 tbsp non dairy milk (room temperature)\n3 tbsp cocoa powder\n1/2 tsp baking powder\n1/4 tsp salt\n1.5 tbsp coconut flour ((see notes for subs))\n1 tbsp tapioca starch (or other starch)\n1/4 cup mini chocolate chips\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 350 deg F (180 C). Line a baking sheet with parchment. Mix the tahini, sugar, vanilla, non-dairy milk until well combined. Do not over mix as the tahini will seize into a stiff mixture.&nbsp;\nAdd the rest of the ingredients and mix gently. (You can also add in 1/4 cup shredded coconut at this point). Add in the chocolate chips and fold in.\nShape into flattened cookies on a parchment lined baking sheet. Press a few chocolate chips on the top if needed. (You can also sprinkle some maldon salt on top and press in. Salt helps reduce the bitter profile).\nBake at 350 degrees F for 10 mins** Cool for 2 mins then remove from the baking sheet and allow to cool down completely before serving. &nbsp;", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 27, "INGREDIENT"], [29, 36, "PROCESS"], [38, 45, "QUANTITY"], [46, 59, "INGREDIENT"], [76, 81, "INGREDIENT"], [93, 100, "QUANTITY"], [101, 116, "INGREDIENT"], [117, 123, "QUANTITY"], [124, 138, "INGREDIENT"], [158, 164, "QUANTITY"], [165, 177, "INGREDIENT"], [178, 185, "QUANTITY"], [186, 199, "INGREDIENT"], [200, 207, "QUANTITY"], [208, 212, "INGREDIENT"], [222, 235, "INGREDIENT"], [259, 265, "QUANTITY"], [266, 280, "INGREDIENT"], [291, 297, "INGREDIENT"], [299, 306, "QUANTITY"], [307, 327, "INGREDIENT"], [389, 395, "PROCESS"], [426, 432, "INGREDIENT"], [434, 439, "INGREDIENT"], [441, 448, "INGREDIENT"], [450, 464, "INGREDIENT"], [498, 501, "PROCESS"], [509, 515, "INGREDIENT"], [591, 594, "PROCESS"], [608, 611, "INGREDIENT"], [617, 620, "PROCESS"], [624, 631, "QUANTITY"], [632, 648, "INGREDIENT"], [676, 691, "INGREDIENT"], [755, 761, "PROCESS"], [781, 796, "INGREDIENT"], [824, 827, "INGREDIENT"], [833, 841, "PROCESS"], [854, 858, "INGREDIENT"], [870, 875, "PROCESS"], [880, 884, "INGREDIENT"], [992, 998, "PROCESS"]]}]
