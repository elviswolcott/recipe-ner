Add more one tbsp at a time until the mixture is a thick batter. Wait for 2 minutes to see if the consistency of the batter gets thinner by itself. If not, add another tbsp of the carbonated water and mix in.The batter will initially feel sludgy and less But will increase in volume and become light after 5 minutes.\u00c2\u00a0\nHeat your waffle iron, grease it a bit. Pour the thick sticky batter into the waffle iron to cook. These waffles rise a lot, so you&#039;ll want to use just a bit of batter and see how much of your waffle iron gets filled up when it rises.\nCook them until they are nice and crispy and done on all the edges and the center.\nRemove the waffle from the waffle iron, and serve with a dollop of butter or whipped coconut cream, and a good drizzle of maple syrup.", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 36, "INGREDIENT"], [37, 44, "QUANTITY"], [45, 54, "INGREDIENT"], [63, 76, "INGREDIENT"], [77, 83, "QUANTITY"], [84, 94, "INGREDIENT"], [100, 114, "INGREDIENT"], [116, 122, "QUANTITY"], [123, 135, "INGREDIENT"], [146, 152, "QUANTITY"], [180, 187, "QUANTITY"], [188, 217, "INGREDIENT"], [218, 225, "QUANTITY"], [226, 230, "INGREDIENT"], [233, 239, "QUANTITY"], [240, 245, "INGREDIENT"], [246, 251, "QUANTITY"], [252, 255, "INGREDIENT"], [256, 263, "QUANTITY"], [264, 279, "INGREDIENT"], [280, 287, "QUANTITY"], [288, 311, "INGREDIENT"], [312, 319, "QUANTITY"], [320, 350, "INGREDIENT"], [353, 362, "INGREDIENT"], [364, 370, "INGREDIENT"], [405, 410, "INGREDIENT"], [489, 494, "PROCESS"], [507, 510, "INGREDIENT"], [512, 519, "INGREDIENT"], [521, 533, "INGREDIENT"], [547, 550, "PROCESS"], [563, 570, "QUANTITY"], [574, 583, "INGREDIENT"], [588, 591, "PROCESS"], [749, 752, "PROCESS"], [784, 789, "INGREDIENT"], [794, 797, "PROCESS"], [1005, 1009, "PROCESS"], [1302, 1308, "INGREDIENT"], [1312, 1333, "INGREDIENT"], [1354, 1368, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
