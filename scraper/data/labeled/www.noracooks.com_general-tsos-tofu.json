["Ingredients:\n2 (16-oz) blocks firm or extra-firm tofu\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n2 tablespoons cornstarch\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n4 cloves garlic, minced\n1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger (*may use 1/2 teaspoon dried ginger if needed)\n1/3 cup seasoned rice vinegar\n1/3 cup low sodium soy sauce  (*tamari for gluten free)\n1 tablespoon hoisin sauce\n1/2 cup water\n1/3 cup granulated sugar\n1/2 teaspoon red chili flakes\n2 tablespoons cornstarch + 1/4 cup water\n4 cups cooked rice, white or brown\nchopped green onions\nsesame seeds\nOptional:  steamed broccoli\n\nInstructions:\nPress the tofu:\u00c2\u00a0Wrap the block of tofu in paper towels. Place a plate or pan on top of the wrapped tofu, and put a couple of heavy books on top of that. Let the tofu press for 20 minutes.\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees F and lightly grease a large baking sheet with oil (or line with parchment paper).\nSlice the tofu into 6 slices. Now, rip each slice into medium-large pieces. You can also simply cut them into cubes, if you prefer, but ripping gives the tofu a great jagged texture.\nAdd the tofu pieces to a large ziplock bag (or large bowl), along with the olive oil, cornstarch and salt. Close the bag, and shake gently to coat. Arrange the tofu evenly on the prepared pan, and bake for 25 minutes, or until golden and crispy.\nWhile the tofu bakes, cook your rice and make the sauce. In a large pan, warm the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for 1-2 minutes, until fragrant. Next, add the rice vinegar, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, water, sugar and red chili flakes. Stir well and bring to a simmer.\nIn a small bowl, stir the cornstarch and water together, then pour into the pan with the sauce. Stir constantly, until the sauce thickens.\nWhen the tofu is done baking, add it to the sauce and stir to coat the pieces. Serve with rice, a sprinkle of sesame seeds, chopped green onions and perhaps a side of steamed broccoli.
