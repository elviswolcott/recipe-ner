["Ingredients:\n2  Pears (, thinly sliced (1/4 inch thick)\n3 tbsp maple syrup  (or brown sugar for more caramelized, or half of each)\n3/4 cup non dairy milk (such as almond, soy)\n1/4 cup pear puree or applesauce ((I usually blend up leftover pear and use it))\n1 tbsp lemon juice\n1/3 cup sugar\n1/4 cup oil\n1 tsp vanilla extract\n1 tsp cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice or chai spice (or cinnamon + cardamom)\n1.5 cups flour ((I use a mix of all purpose and wheat), see notes for Glutenfree)\n2 tsp baking powder\n1/4 tsp baking soda\n1/2 tsp salt\n\nInstructions:\nLine a 8 or 9 inch cake pan with parchment at the bottom. Arrange pear slices as you like. Pour the maple syrup (or sprinkle the sugar) all over the pear slices. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180C)\nBlend the remaining pear in a blender with 1-2 tsp of water until it is like applesauce. Measure out 1/4 cup of the puree and use in the cake. Or use applesauce.\nMix all the wet ingredients in a bowl until well combined.\nMix the baking powder, baking soda and salt into the flour. Add 1.25 cups flour to the wet and mix in. Add 1-2 tbsp more at a time to make a thick batter, not too stiff but not too flowy.\nPour gently on top of the pear slices in the cake pan and spread to even it out.\nBake for 35 to 40 minutes or until a toothpick from the enter comes out clean.\nCool for 15 mins, then remove cake by inverting it over a dish.&nbsp;Carefully peel off the parchment.\nSprinkle a good pinch of cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice or other fave spice blend on the pears. Cool for another 10 mins, then slice and serve with whipped coconut cream or vegan ice cream", {"entities": [[25, 38, "INGREDIENT"], [56, 62, "QUANTITY"], [63, 74, "INGREDIENT"], [80, 91, "INGREDIENT"], [125, 129, "INGREDIENT"], [131, 138, "QUANTITY"], [139, 153, "INGREDIENT"], [176, 183, "QUANTITY"], [184, 208, "INGREDIENT"], [257, 263, "QUANTITY"], [264, 275, "INGREDIENT"], [276, 283, "QUANTITY"], [284, 289, "INGREDIENT"], [290, 297, "QUANTITY"], [298, 301, "INGREDIENT"], [302, 307, "QUANTITY"], [308, 323, "INGREDIENT"], [324, 329, "QUANTITY"], [330, 373, "INGREDIENT"], [378, 386, "INGREDIENT"], [389, 397, "INGREDIENT"], [408, 413, "INGREDIENT"], [424, 427, "PROCESS"], [481, 486, "QUANTITY"], [487, 500, "INGREDIENT"], [501, 508, "QUANTITY"], [509, 520, "INGREDIENT"], [521, 528, "QUANTITY"], [529, 533, "INGREDIENT"], [649, 660, "INGREDIENT"], [665, 673, "PROCESS"], [678, 683, "INGREDIENT"], [797, 802, "QUANTITY"], [803, 811, "INGREDIENT"], [829, 839, "INGREDIENT"], [853, 860, "QUANTITY"], [868, 873, "INGREDIENT"], [902, 912, "INGREDIENT"], [981, 994, "INGREDIENT"], [996, 1007, "INGREDIENT"], [1012, 1016, "INGREDIENT"], [1026, 1031, "INGREDIENT"], [1047, 1052, "INGREDIENT"], [1068, 1071, "PROCESS"], [1082, 1088, "QUANTITY"], [1449, 1478, "INGREDIENT"], [1493, 1498, "INGREDIENT"], [1571, 1592, "INGREDIENT"], [1602, 1605, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
