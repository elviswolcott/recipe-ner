Warm the non dairy milk until hot. Mix with the rest of the ingredients except yeast and mix well until sugar is combined. Add the yeast and mix in.&nbsp;\nIn a bowl, mix 3/4 cup flour and rest of the dry ingredients. Add the flour mix to the wet and mix in. Add a tbsp or so more flour if needed (if the mix is runny). Let the mixture sit for 10-15 minutes.\nSpoon into greased donut pan. You can also fill up a ziplock, cut one end and squeeze the batter into the pan. Let the pan sit for another 10 minutes for the batter to rise, Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.\nBake for 11 to 12 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes then remove from pan.\nAdd cinnamon and sugar to a small ziplock bag and mix. Take the warm donuts, add to the ziplock, shake. Remove from the ziplock and serve.

If you'd like more topping, brush oil on the donuts before dipping.&nbsp;", {"entities": [[13, 20, "QUANTITY"], [21, 35, "INGREDIENT"], [61, 68, "QUANTITY"], [69, 82, "INGREDIENT"], [83, 89, "QUANTITY"], [90, 95, "INGREDIENT"], [96, 101, "QUANTITY"], [102, 114, "INGREDIENT"], [115, 121, "QUANTITY"], [122, 154, "INGREDIENT"], [155, 160, "QUANTITY"], [161, 176, "INGREDIENT"], [186, 191, "QUANTITY"], [215, 220, "QUANTITY"], [221, 238, "INGREDIENT"], [259, 265, "INGREDIENT"], [266, 273, "QUANTITY"], [275, 303, "INGREDIENT"], [312, 318, "QUANTITY"], [336, 342, "QUANTITY"], [343, 355, "INGREDIENT"], [365, 371, "QUANTITY"], [377, 382, "INGREDIENT"], [384, 389, "QUANTITY"], [390, 403, "INGREDIENT"], [405, 413, "INGREDIENT"], [414, 419, "QUANTITY"], [420, 428, "INGREDIENT"], [429, 435, "QUANTITY"], [436, 446, "INGREDIENT"], [452, 468, "INGREDIENT"], [516, 530, "INGREDIENT"], [586, 591, "INGREDIENT"], [596, 599, "PROCESS"], [611, 616, "INGREDIENT"], [638, 643, "INGREDIENT"], [648, 651, "PROCESS"], [673, 676, "PROCESS"], [677, 684, "QUANTITY"], [685, 690, "INGREDIENT"], [732, 737, "INGREDIENT"], [738, 741, "PROCESS"], [757, 760, "PROCESS"], [776, 781, "INGREDIENT"], [787, 792, "INGREDIENT"], [811, 814, "PROCESS"], [899, 902, "INGREDIENT"], [1146, 1154, "INGREDIENT"], [1159, 1164, "INGREDIENT"], [1192, 1195, "PROCESS"], [1219, 1222, "PROCESS"], [1285, 1288, "INGREDIENT"], [1317, 1325, "INGREDIENT"], [1326, 1331, "INGREDIENT"], [1477, 1480, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
