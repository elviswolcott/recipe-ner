["Ingredients:\n1-1.5 cups nuts of choice (Cashews, pecans, walnuts, almonds, macadamia, pistachios etc)\n1 teaspoon oil\n1/2 teaspoon spice blend of choice like garam masala or chana masala spice blend\n1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste\nblack pepper or chili powder to taste\n\nInstructions:\nIn a large skillet, add a teaspoon of oil and heat over low-medium.\nWhen hot, add a cup of nuts(I used cashews, walnuts, pecans, almonds, pistachios), salt, black pepper and chana masala spice blend to taste, and mix to coat well.\nRoast on stove stirring every few seconds for 8-10 minutes until cashews start to look golden.(Reduce heat to low after 6 or so minutes to reduce chances of burning)\nTake off heat. The nuts will continue to roast for the next 2-3 minutes once off heat too. The Omega fats in the nuts can burn and damage easily, so roast them to just a light golden.\nCool completely, adjust salt and spice. Snack!\nYou can also bake these for about 12-15 minutes at preheated 330 degrees F. Stir once after 10 minutes and check on them. Oven temperatures vary, so keep the temperature on the lower side.\nYou can roast the nuts on stove or bake with no oil too, the spices and herbs might not stick as well.", {"entities": [[24, 38, "INGREDIENT"], [40, 47, "INGREDIENT"], [49, 56, "INGREDIENT"], [57, 64, "INGREDIENT"], [66, 73, "INGREDIENT"], [102, 112, "QUANTITY"], [113, 116, "INGREDIENT"], [117, 129, "QUANTITY"], [130, 197, "INGREDIENT"], [198, 210, "QUANTITY"], [211, 227, "INGREDIENT"], [228, 240, "INGREDIENT"], [244, 256, "INGREDIENT"], [301, 304, "PROCESS"], [316, 322, "INGREDIENT"], [359, 362, "PROCESS"], [365, 368, "QUANTITY"], [384, 391, "INGREDIENT"], [393, 400, "INGREDIENT"], [402, 409, "INGREDIENT"], [410, 417, "INGREDIENT"], [432, 436, "INGREDIENT"], [438, 450, "INGREDIENT"], [455, 479, "INGREDIENT"], [494, 497, "PROCESS"], [527, 535, "PROCESS"], [577, 584, "INGREDIENT"], [634, 639, "INGREDIENT"], [697, 701, "INGREDIENT"], [719, 724, "PROCESS"], [791, 795, "INGREDIENT"], [796, 799, "INGREDIENT"], [827, 832, "PROCESS"], [886, 890, "INGREDIENT"], [895, 900, "INGREDIENT"], [913, 916, "INGREDIENT"], [922, 926, "PROCESS"], [1102, 1105, "INGREDIENT"], [1106, 1111, "PROCESS"], [1116, 1120, "INGREDIENT"], [1133, 1137, "PROCESS"], [1146, 1149, "INGREDIENT"], [1170, 1175, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
