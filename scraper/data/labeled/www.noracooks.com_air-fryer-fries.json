["Ingredients:\n4-5  medium red potatoes\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n1 tablespoon cornstarch\n1/2 teaspoon salt, or more to taste\n1 teaspoon garlic powder\n1 teaspoon onion powder\n1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika\n\nInstructions:\nRinse and scrub the potatoes, then dry well with a towel.\nSlice the potatoes into french fry shapes, either by hand or using a mandolin if you have one. There is no need to peel the potatoes.\nPlace the potatoes in a large ziplock bag, along with the olive oil, cornstarch, salt and optional seasonings if using. Close the bag, and shake, shake, shake! The potatoes should be coated with the oil, cornstarch and seasonings.\nSpray the bottom of your air fryer basket with oil to prevent sticking. Add the coated potatoes and air fry at 400 degrees for 20-30 minutes until crispy, but not burnt, giving a little shake every 5-10 minutes.\nDo this in batches, depending on how large your air fryer is. I did two batches to prevent too full of a basket. Serve immediately.", {"entities": [[29, 37, "INGREDIENT"], [38, 51, "QUANTITY"], [52, 61, "INGREDIENT"], [62, 74, "QUANTITY"], [75, 85, "INGREDIENT"], [86, 98, "QUANTITY"], [99, 121, "INGREDIENT"], [122, 132, "QUANTITY"], [133, 146, "INGREDIENT"], [147, 157, "QUANTITY"], [158, 170, "INGREDIENT"], [171, 183, "QUANTITY"], [184, 198, "INGREDIENT"], [234, 242, "INGREDIENT"], [282, 290, "INGREDIENT"], [303, 306, "PROCESS"], [396, 404, "INGREDIENT"], [416, 424, "INGREDIENT"], [464, 473, "INGREDIENT"], [475, 485, "INGREDIENT"], [487, 491, "INGREDIENT"], [570, 578, "INGREDIENT"], [605, 608, "INGREDIENT"], [610, 620, "INGREDIENT"], [684, 687, "INGREDIENT"], [724, 732, "INGREDIENT"], [741, 744, "PROCESS"]]}]
