["Ingredients:\n1.5 cups  + 2 tbsp apple cider (not vinegar, but the fermented apple drink)\n1/4 cup sugar ((coconut sugar, date sugar, regular or use maple syrup), 1/3 cup for sweeter)\n1 cup flour ((I use a mix of 1/4 cup whole wheat and 3/4 cup all purpose), see note for gluten-free)\n1 tbsp almond flour (, or use more flour)\n3/4 tsp cinnamon\n1/8 tsp cardamom or nutmeg\ndash of black pepper\n1/4 tsp salt\n1 tsp baking powder\n1/4 tsp baking soda\n1 tbsp oil or applesauce ((or both for extra moisture when using whole grain flours))\n1 tbsp cane sugar\n1 tbsp coconut sugar or brown sugar\n1/2 tsp cinnamon\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 350 deg F(180 C). Grease a donut pan or line muffin pan. Cook 1.5 cups cider and sugar in a saucepan over medium heat for 20 to 25 mins to reduce to a scant 1 cup. Cool the cider to room temp. (cooling will reduce the cider further to about 3/4 cup + 2 tbsp)\nIn a bowl, mix the rest the dry ingredients. Add the concentrated cider and oil/applesauce. Mix well to combine. If the batter is too thick, mix in non dairy milk 1 tbsp at a time until it is just a bit flowy to be able to spoon it in. If the batter is too thin, add in 1-2 tbsp flour\nImmediately spoon the batter into the donut pan or muffin pan. Even out the batter for even shape for donuts.\nBake for 11-12 mins for donuts or mini muffins, 20-22 mins for regular muffins. Cool for 5 mins, then release from the pan.\nMix the cinnamon sugar into a ziplock.(or add to a shallow bowl)\nCool the donuts for another 5 mins. Brush donuts with the non dairy milk or cider, or use oil/melted vegan butter. Add to the ziplock and shake, or dip\u00c2\u00a0in the sugar mixture.", {"entities": [[23, 43, "INGREDIENT"], [49, 56, "INGREDIENT"], [89, 96, "QUANTITY"], [97, 102, "INGREDIENT"], [105, 118, "INGREDIENT"], [125, 130, "INGREDIENT"], [147, 158, "INGREDIENT"], [161, 168, "QUANTITY"], [182, 187, "QUANTITY"], [188, 193, "INGREDIENT"], [204, 207, "PROCESS"], [211, 218, "QUANTITY"], [219, 230, "INGREDIENT"], [235, 242, "QUANTITY"], [283, 289, "QUANTITY"], [290, 302, "INGREDIENT"], [318, 323, "INGREDIENT"], [325, 332, "QUANTITY"], [333, 341, "INGREDIENT"], [342, 349, "QUANTITY"], [350, 368, "INGREDIENT"], [374, 389, "INGREDIENT"], [390, 397, "QUANTITY"], [398, 402, "INGREDIENT"], [403, 408, "QUANTITY"], [409, 422, "INGREDIENT"], [423, 430, "QUANTITY"], [431, 442, "INGREDIENT"], [443, 449, "QUANTITY"], [450, 467, "INGREDIENT"], [529, 535, "QUANTITY"], [536, 546, "INGREDIENT"], [547, 553, "QUANTITY"], [554, 582, "INGREDIENT"], [583, 590, "QUANTITY"], [591, 599, "INGREDIENT"], [716, 721, "INGREDIENT"], [792, 797, "QUANTITY"], [876, 883, "QUANTITY"], [886, 892, "QUANTITY"], [905, 908, "PROCESS"], [970, 973, "INGREDIENT"], [974, 984, "INGREDIENT"], [1035, 1038, "PROCESS"], [1042, 1056, "INGREDIENT"], [1057, 1063, "QUANTITY"], [1151, 1155, "PROCESS"], [1157, 1160, "PROCESS"], [1166, 1172, "QUANTITY"], [1173, 1178, "INGREDIENT"], [1421, 1429, "INGREDIENT"], [1430, 1435, "INGREDIENT"], [1455, 1458, "PROCESS"], [1536, 1550, "INGREDIENT"], [1568, 1571, "INGREDIENT"], [1572, 1591, "INGREDIENT"], [1638, 1643, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
