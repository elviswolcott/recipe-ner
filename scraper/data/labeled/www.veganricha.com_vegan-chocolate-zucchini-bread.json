["Ingredients:\n3/4  shredded zucchini (from roughly 1 small zucchini)\n1 1/2 cups flour (I used a mix of 1 cup all purpose 1/2 cup spelt)\n1/4 cup cocoa\n1.5 teaspoon baking powder\n1/4 teaspoon baking soda\n1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt\n1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n teaspoon ground cardamom (Optional)\n teaspoon ground nutmeg\n1/2 cup brown sugar  (or coconut sugar)\n1/4 cup apple sauce\n1/4 cup neutral-tasting oil of choice (avocado, sunflower, refined coconut etc)\n1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract\n3/4 cup non dairy milk\n1/2 cup dairy-free chocolate chips  (- Half in batter and half for topping)\n\nInstructions:\nShred the zucchini and place on a layer of paper towels and set aside while you prep the rest of the ingredients. In a bowl, mix all the dry ingredients until well combined. Now,\u00c2\u00a0 add in the wet ingredients except for the zucchini and chocolate chips and mix well to make a stiff batter.\nThe batter should be somewhat stiff. If it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t then add 1 to 2 tablespoons more flour and mix in. Squeeze the zucchini shreds in the layer of paper towel over your sink to remove the excess moisture, then add the zucchini to the batter along with half of the chocolate chips. Fold zucchini and chocolate chips into the batter. Now, pour the batter into a prepared loaf pan (9 x 5) and sprinkle remaining chocolate chips on top.\nBake at 365F for 50 to 55 minutes or until a toothpick from the center comes out clean clean. Cool for 15 minutes then remove from the pan. Cool completely before slicing.\nStore: Store on the counter for the day and refrigerate for up to 7 days.You can add ganache on this bread instead of the chocolate chips. Melt 1/2 cup vegan chocolate chips with 1/4 cup coconut cream in a double boiler. Once smooth, spread over baked and cooled bread.", {"entities": [[18, 35, "INGREDIENT"], [68, 78, "QUANTITY"], [79, 84, "INGREDIENT"], [95, 98, "PROCESS"], [102, 107, "QUANTITY"], [120, 127, "QUANTITY"], [128, 133, "INGREDIENT"], [135, 142, "QUANTITY"], [143, 148, "INGREDIENT"], [162, 175, "INGREDIENT"], [176, 188, "QUANTITY"], [189, 200, "INGREDIENT"], [201, 213, "QUANTITY"], [214, 227, "INGREDIENT"], [228, 240, "QUANTITY"], [241, 256, "INGREDIENT"], [267, 282, "INGREDIENT"], [304, 317, "INGREDIENT"], [318, 325, "QUANTITY"], [326, 337, "INGREDIENT"], [343, 356, "INGREDIENT"], [358, 365, "QUANTITY"], [366, 377, "INGREDIENT"], [378, 385, "QUANTITY"], [386, 415, "INGREDIENT"], [445, 452, "INGREDIENT"], [458, 470, "QUANTITY"], [471, 486, "INGREDIENT"], [487, 494, "QUANTITY"], [495, 509, "INGREDIENT"], [510, 517, "QUANTITY"], [518, 544, "INGREDIENT"], [624, 629, "PROCESS"], [726, 729, "PROCESS"], [782, 785, "PROCESS"], [837, 852, "INGREDIENT"], [857, 860, "PROCESS"], [946, 949, "PROCESS"], [955, 968, "QUANTITY"], [974, 979, "INGREDIENT"], [984, 987, "PROCESS"], [1099, 1102, "PROCESS"], [1153, 1168, "INGREDIENT"], [1188, 1203, "INGREDIENT"], [1279, 1287, "PROCESS"], [1298, 1313, "INGREDIENT"], [1571, 1574, "INGREDIENT"], [1575, 1578, "PROCESS"], [1616, 1631, "INGREDIENT"], [1638, 1645, "QUANTITY"], [1646, 1667, "INGREDIENT"], [1673, 1680, "QUANTITY"], [1681, 1694, "INGREDIENT"], [1740, 1745, "PROCESS"]]}]
