["Ingredients:\n1 cup rolled oats\n4 cups cold water\n2 tablespoons pure maple syrup, or more to taste\n1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n\nInstructions:\nTo a high powered blender, add the rolled oats, cold water and optional sweetener and vanilla. Blend on high for 30 seconds, not longer or your milk may become slimy.\nGently strain the oat milk through a nut milk bag or thin towel over a large bowl. Don&#039;t squeeze too much, a gently squeeze is best. If there is still quite a bit of oat sediment in the bowl, strain it once more.\nPour into containers and store in the refrigerator for 5-6 days. Separation is natural, so shake before using. It can also be frozen, if needed.", {"entities": [[13, 18, "QUANTITY"], [19, 30, "INGREDIENT"], [31, 37, "QUANTITY"], [38, 48, "INGREDIENT"], [49, 62, "QUANTITY"], [63, 97, "INGREDIENT"], [98, 110, "QUANTITY"], [111, 131, "INGREDIENT"], [174, 177, "PROCESS"], [182, 193, "INGREDIENT"], [195, 205, "INGREDIENT"], [219, 228, "INGREDIENT"], [233, 240, "INGREDIENT"], [291, 295, "INGREDIENT"], [332, 340, "INGREDIENT"], [355, 359, "INGREDIENT"], [367, 371, "PROCESS"], [646, 649, "INGREDIENT"], [658, 664, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
