["Ingredients:\n7.5 Tablespoons raw sugar or jaggery\n3.5 Tablespoons water\n1/2 teaspoon orange zest\n1 Tablespoon grated red beet\n1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder or spice of choice\n1 cup shredded fresh coconut (not dried (depends on whether you are using freshly grated or frozen))\n2 Tablespoons dried coconut flakes for rolling\n\nInstructions:\nIn a pan, mix the sugar and water and bring to a boil, Add zest, beet and spice and keep boiling on low till the syrup reaches soft ball consistency (a drop of syrup in cold water will form a soft ball and not mix in the water).\nAdd shredded coconut and mix. Add enough coconut so the mixture is a slightly stiff batter instead of liquid. If using frozen coconut, there will be some moisture and you might need to add more coconut after a minute of cooking.\nKeep cooking the mix on low heat, stirring occasionally, till it comes together as a ball(15-20 minutes).\nPat this mix on parchment lined tray(6 by 3), let cool for 10 minutes and then cut into squares, or use a heart shaped cookie cutter, or roll into balls. Roll balls into dried shredded coconut. You can also dip the balls or heart shapes in some melted vegan chocolate! Dip and let set on parchment.", {"entities": [[29, 49, "INGREDIENT"], [66, 71, "INGREDIENT"], [72, 84, "QUANTITY"], [85, 96, "INGREDIENT"], [97, 109, "QUANTITY"], [110, 125, "INGREDIENT"], [126, 138, "QUANTITY"], [139, 173, "INGREDIENT"], [174, 179, "QUANTITY"], [180, 202, "INGREDIENT"], [256, 262, "INGREDIENT"], [266, 272, "INGREDIENT"], [275, 288, "QUANTITY"], [289, 321, "INGREDIENT"], [347, 350, "PROCESS"], [355, 360, "INGREDIENT"], [365, 370, "INGREDIENT"], [386, 390, "PROCESS"], [411, 416, "INGREDIENT"], [426, 433, "PROCESS"], [506, 516, "INGREDIENT"], [547, 550, "PROCESS"], [558, 563, "INGREDIENT"], [570, 586, "INGREDIENT"], [591, 594, "PROCESS"], [607, 614, "INGREDIENT"], [685, 691, "INGREDIENT"], [692, 700, "INGREDIENT"], [751, 754, "PROCESS"], [760, 767, "INGREDIENT"], [786, 793, "PROCESS"], [800, 807, "PROCESS"], [812, 815, "PROCESS"], [829, 837, "PROCESS"], [910, 913, "PROCESS"], [1071, 1093, "INGREDIENT"], [1099, 1102, "INGREDIENT"], [1159, 1168, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
