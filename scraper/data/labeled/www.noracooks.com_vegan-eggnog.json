["Ingredients:\n1 cup raw cashews (see notes for alternatives)\n3 cups non-dairy milk\n1/4-1/2 cup granulated sugar or pure maple syrup\n1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg\n1/2 teaspoon cinnamon\n1/4 teaspoon cloves\n1 ounce whiskey or rum, per serving, optional\n\nInstructions:\nBring 3 cups of water to a boil. Pour the hot water over the cashews and let soak for 5 minutes.\nDrain the cashews and discard the soaking water. Add them to a blender along with the non-dairy milk, sugar (you can start with the 1/4 cup), vanilla, nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves and blend until very smooth.

Serve alcohol free or add 1 ounce of whiskey/rum to each glass, as desired. I also topped mine with a little coconut whipped cream and a sprinkle of nutmeg.", {"entities": [[13, 18, "QUANTITY"], [19, 30, "INGREDIENT"], [60, 66, "QUANTITY"], [67, 81, "INGREDIENT"], [86, 93, "QUANTITY"], [94, 130, "INGREDIENT"], [131, 141, "QUANTITY"], [142, 162, "INGREDIENT"], [163, 175, "QUANTITY"], [176, 189, "INGREDIENT"], [190, 202, "QUANTITY"], [203, 211, "INGREDIENT"], [212, 224, "QUANTITY"], [225, 231, "INGREDIENT"], [232, 239, "QUANTITY"], [240, 277, "INGREDIENT"], [299, 305, "QUANTITY"], [306, 314, "INGREDIENT"], [320, 324, "PROCESS"], [335, 344, "INGREDIENT"], [354, 361, "INGREDIENT"], [400, 407, "INGREDIENT"], [432, 437, "INGREDIENT"], [476, 490, "INGREDIENT"], [492, 497, "INGREDIENT"], [503, 506, "INGREDIENT"], [522, 529, "QUANTITY"], [532, 539, "INGREDIENT"], [541, 547, "INGREDIENT"], [549, 557, "INGREDIENT"], [562, 568, "INGREDIENT"], [605, 608, "PROCESS"], [614, 623, "INGREDIENT"], [795, 798, "PROCESS"], [799, 806, "QUANTITY"], [818, 821, "INGREDIENT"], [825, 829, "INGREDIENT"], [882, 889, "INGREDIENT"], [910, 918, "PROCESS"], [922, 928, "INGREDIENT"]]}]
