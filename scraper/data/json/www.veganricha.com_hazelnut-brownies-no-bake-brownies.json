These Fudgy Brownies are No Bake if you have already roasted Hazelnuts! These brownie bites are like nutella brownies, but no need to make nutella and of course no palm oil or dairy. Just 6 INGREDIENTS in the brownies, toasted hazelnuts, walnuts, dates, cocoa and some maple. I top these with a creamy non dairy chocolate ganache. So good! Serve these with a simple vegan vanilla ice cream or some whipped coconut cream. \n\nThese bars are easy, fudgy and perfect for the sweet snack attack! Make these and let me know how they turned out! You can use all walnuts and skip the toasting step to omit hazelnuts. Or use hazelnut butter or other toasted nut butter.
