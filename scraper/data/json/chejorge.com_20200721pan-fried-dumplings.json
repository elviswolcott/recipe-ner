Take your rested dough and first gently press it down to squeeze out excess air. Roll the dough into a long log and use a knife to evenly divide it into around 22-25 pieces. Roll each piece of dough into round balls. Take a ball of dough and first gently press it to flatten. Then take a floured rolling pin and roll the dough out on all sides into a round sheet, thickest at the center. Take each wrapper and place around a tablespoon of filling in the middle. Fold the dough up by pleating the sides (like an accordion) in a counter-clockwise motion. Towards the end, keep your thumb in the middle and press down while spiraling to seal. Place the completed dumplings on a floured surface and loosely cover them while you prepare the rest.","text":"Make the Dumplings.

Heat up around 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil on medium-high heat in a non-stick pan. Place each dumpling in the pan (don't over-crowd the pan as they will expand!) and fry until lightly browned around 1-2 minutes. Then, add 3 tablespoons of water and quickly cover with a lid to trap steam. Note: if your lid doesn't have a built-in hole, leave a small hole so the dumplings won't burst when you open the lid. Remove the lid once most of the water has evaporated, around 5 minutes. Turn the heat up to high and cook for an additional 2 minutes, or until crispy and golden-brown. Top the finished dumplings with sesame seeds and chopped scallions. Serve warm.","text":"Fry the Dumplings. Heat up around 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil on medium-high heat in a non-stick pan.
