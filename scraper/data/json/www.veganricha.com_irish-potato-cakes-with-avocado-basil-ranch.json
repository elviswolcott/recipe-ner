I use flax as the egg substitute. These cakes come together easily. Boil and mash half the potatoes, grate the rest. Mix in, add some flour, egg sub, salt, pepper, other flavors of choice, and cook on the pan until golden. Serve with vegan ranch or other dressings of choice. \n\n\nBUY MY COOKBOOK: http://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen \n\nSUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n#vegan #veganism #easyveganrecipes #veganrecipes #veganricha #cooking \n✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧\nFOLLOW US:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nCOOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book:\nhttp://www.veganricha.com/vrekaz\n\nMY AMAZON STORE: https://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha\n✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧\n\nMusic:  Doing Just fine by Lakey Inspired\nhttps://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired/","uploadDate":"2018-02-12T16:00:03+00:00","duration":"PT2M","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mMG5xE30MVw/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://youtu.be/mMG5xE30MVw","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mMG5xE30MVw?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["2","2 servings"],"prepTime":"PT10M","cookTime":"PT30M","totalTime":"PT40M","recipeIngredient":["2  large russets","3/4 teaspoon fine salt (plus more for seasoning the potatoes before cooking)","1/4 teaspoon or more freshly ground black pepper","1/4 cup non dairy milk","1 tbsp flax seed meal","1-2 tbsp nutritional yeast (optional)","a generous pinch of kala namak (Indian black salt optional)","1 tsp oil","1/2 tsp lemon juice","1/4-1/3 cup unbleached all purpose flour (or use a gluten-free flour which is neutral tasting)","1/2 tsp baking powder","oil for cooking","1  ripe avocado","1 tbsp fresh basil","1/2 tsp garlic","1/2 tsp or more ranch seasoning ((see notes))","generous dash of black pepper and salt","2 tsp lime juice","water as needed"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Chop 1 potato and add to a pot of cold water.
