Saucepan Option | VEGAN RICHA RECIPES","description":"Instant Pot Eggplant Sweet Potato Lentil Curry. Saucepan Option.\nFULL RECIPE HERE ➡️ https://www.veganricha.com/2017/11/instant-pot-sweet-potato-lentil-curry.html \n\n\nThis 1 Pot Sweet Potato Eggplant and Lentil Curry is easy, flavorful and comes together quickly. I make variations of this often with brown or green Lentils, green Mung Beans, a combination of the two, different Veggies and spices. The combination of earthy lentils, hearty mung beans as in the video and veggies like eggplant and sweet potato makes for an amazing meal.  Use any veggies of choice. \n\nServe this hearty warming bowl as a Soup or as dal with rice or grains or flatbread. Make it with various spice blends as Garam Masala or Berbere or Baharat (from Everyday Kitchen Cookbook). \n\nVegan Gluten-free Soy-free Nut-free Recipe. Make it in a saucepan or InstantPot Pressure Cooker. Easily made oil-free. #vegan #video #instantpot\nFULL RECIPE HERE: https://www.veganricha.com/2017/11/instant-pot-sweet-potato-lentil-curry.html \n\n\nBUY MY COOKBOOK: http://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen \n\nSUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n#vegan #veganism #easyveganrecipes #veganrecipes #veganricha #cooking \n✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧\nFOLLOW US:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nCOOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book:\nhttp://www.veganricha.com/vrekaz\n\nMY AMAZON STORE: https://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha\n✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧\n\n\nMusic by Joakim Karud:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/JoakimKarud/videos","uploadDate":"2018-02-27T19:02:40+00:00","duration":"PT1M28S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vSdWP0Lji-8/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSdWP0Lji-8","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vSdWP0Lji-8?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["4"],"prepTime":"PT15M","cookTime":"PT35M","totalTime":"PT50M","recipeIngredient":["3/4 cup lentils or a mix of (brown/green) lentils and mung beans (, soaked in warm hot water for atleast 15 mins)","1 tsp oil (, or use water to saute to make oil-free)","1/2  onion (chopped)","4 cloves of garlic (chopped)","an inch of ginger (chopped)","1/2  or 1 hot green chile (chopped)","1/4 tsp turmeric","1/2 to 1 tsp garam masala","1/2 tsp ground cumin or ground coriander","15 oz tomatoes ((2 medium tomatoes, chopped)","1 cup (heaping) chopped eggplant (, or use other hearty vegetables of choice)","1 cup cubed sweet potatoes","3/4 tsp salt","2 cups water (3 cups for saucepan)","a big handful of spinach","cayenne and lemon/lime to taste","pepper flakes for garnish"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Soak the lentils if you havent already and get the ingredients ready, Switch the IP to saute.
