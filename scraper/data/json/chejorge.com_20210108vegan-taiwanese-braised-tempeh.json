In a pot or wok, heat up 1-2 tablespoons of vegetable oil (or other neutral oil) on medium heat. Add the doubanjiang and fry until fragrant (the oil should turn orange), about 1 minute. Follow with the garlic, ginger, dried chilis, and shallots. Fry while constantly stirring for 2-3 minutes, then add back the minced tempeh and minced mushrooms, along with the star-anise and bay leaf (if adding). Cook to lightly brown the tempeh, about 3-4 minutes. Deglaze the pot with soy sauce, mushroom-soaking water, Shaoxing wine, and dark brown sugar (I like to pre-combine them). Cover and braise for 15-20 minutes. Near the end of the braising, remove the lid and reduce the braising liquid to concentrate the flavors. Adjust seasoning with salt at the end.","text":"Braise the Tempeh. In a pot or wok, heat up 1-2 tablespoons of vegetable oil (or other neutral oil) on medium heat.
