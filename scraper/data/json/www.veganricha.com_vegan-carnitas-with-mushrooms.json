Mushrooms marinated in Spicy Smoky Zesty Marinade and Baked. No Oil. \nFULL RECIPE HERE: https://www.veganricha.com/2019/03/vegan-carnitas-with-mushrooms.html\nMY BOOKS: https://veganricha.com/books\n\n\nServe these Mushroom Carnitas with toppings in tacos, wraps, burritos. Use Jackfruit for variation. Glutenfree Nutfree Oilfree Recipe. Soyfree option\n\nEvery since I baked jackfruit with sauce for Pulled Jackfruit Sandwiches ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihU_Ussajm0 ) , I’ve fallen in love with crisp caramelized result! Its much easier, no mess, short active time. Just mix everything and bake! I use the same process for these mushroom Carnitas. Sliced mushrooms, sliced onion, spices, herbs, and a flavorful marinade. Just put everything in a bowl, marinate for a bit if possible, spread in a baking dish and bake and done! No oil needed.\n\nThe onions caramelize to a juicy sweet spicy state. Mushrooms cook wonderfully and crisp. Bake less or more time depending on your preference. Fill up tacos or wraps, add your favorite toppings like mashed avocado/guacamole, vegan sour cream or salsa and done. Add some smoky black beans or refried beans to the tacos for a hearty meal. You can use the same process with Jackfruit, shredded oyster mushrooms, hearts of palm and shredded seitan. \n\nRecipe Details https://www.veganricha.com/2019/03/vegan-carnitas-with-mushrooms.html\n\n\nMusic by DJ Quads, so Proud.","uploadDate":"2019-03-14T17:40:53+00:00","duration":"PT1M4S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KR3IPtR1hUQ/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KR3IPtR1hUQ","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KR3IPtR1hUQ?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["2"],"prepTime":"PT10M","cookTime":"PT35M","totalTime":"PT45M","recipeIngredient":["1  onion (, thinly sliced (small to medium onion))","4 cloves garlic (, finely chopped)","1  jalapeno (, thinly sliced (optional))","12 oz mushrooms (, sliced, (white or combination or white, cremini, portobello))","1/4 cup orange juice (or cider(plain cider not vinegar), half of both)","2 tsp lime juice","1 tbsp soy sauce  (or tamari for glutenfree, or coconut aminos for soyfree)","1/4-1/2 tsp salt","1 tsp ground cumin","2 tsp ground coriander","1.5 tsp smoked paprika (, or use 1 tsp sweet paprika and 1/2 tsp smoked forless heat)","1.5  tsp oregano","1/4 tsp black pepper","1/2 tsp or more chipotle pepper","1 to 2 tsp chili powder blend or use more of the above spices and herbs","optional flavors: Add 1/2 tsp poultry seasoning , add 2 tbsp beer"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Preheat the oven to 400 deg F (205 C).
