Then the sauce is simmered with spices and the brussels tossed in the sauce to pick up some sauce flavor. The first step adds a nice caramelization and partly cooks the sprouts. So then they don’t need to be cooked too long with the sauce or get mushy or over cooked. Change up the flavors to preference and serve these as is or as a side!\n\nYou can serve these brussels with a side of your favorite curry and rice or with vegan meatloaf and mashed potatoes and gravy!\n\nAlso try my \nPan Roasted Brussels with Turmeric and Sesame Seeds: https://www.veganricha.com/2016/04/brussels-sprouts-subzi-indian-spices.html\nHerb Roasted Brussels sprouts and Cauliflower, no dry bits!:\nhttps://www.veganricha.com/2019/01/roasted-brussels-sprouts-and-cauliflower.html\n\n#veganrichareecipes #easyveganrecipes #caramelizedbrusselssprouts #indianrecipe\nMusic By Epidemic sound\n\nFollow: \nMy blog: https://veganricha.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/","uploadDate":"2019-10-18T18:39:49+00:00","duration":"PT2M1S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rgorGSXfezk/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgorGSXfezk","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rgorGSXfezk?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["2"],"prepTime":"PT10M","cookTime":"PT25M","totalTime":"PT35M","recipeIngredient":["2 tsp oil (divided)","1/2 tsp cumin seeds","1 lb brussels sprouts","1/2 cup chopped onion","2 cloves of garlic","1/2  green chili","1/2 tsp turmeric","1/2 tsp garam masala (or use spices and blends like curry powder, jamaican curry powder, ethiopian berbere for variation)","1/3 tsp cayenne","1/2 tsp salt (divided)","1  large tomato (diced)","1/2 cup or more water","cilantro (pepper flakes, lemon juice for garnish)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Remove outer leaves and tough stems from the brussels sprouts.
