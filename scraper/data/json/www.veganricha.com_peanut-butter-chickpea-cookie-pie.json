There is no flavor of the chickpeas. Serve these with your favorite vegan ice cream or as is. I like to make the pie skinnier than a deep dish cookie pie to allow it to crisp and cook evenly and be more cookie like. Other beans such as white beans or navy beans should work as well. This recipe is Gluten-free and can be made Nut-free with sun butter. See the post for substitution details.\n\nThe batter can also be baked into blondie bars. Double the recipe, put everything in a food processor, blend, spread into a pan, and bake into a 9 by 9 brownie pan. Some canned chickpeas are drier than others, and some nut butters bake up differently as well,  so adjust the baking time to make fudgy or more crisp cookie like pie to preference. \n\nONLY MUSIC VERSION: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQFUo22o-XQ\n\nMORE DESSERTS: https://www.veganricha.com/category/dessert\n\nBUY MY COOKBOOK: http://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen \n\n\nSUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n#vegan #veganism #easyveganrecipes #veganrecipes #veganricha #cooking \n✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧\nFOLLOW US:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nCOOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book:\nhttp://www.veganricha.com/vrekaz\n\nMY AMAZON STORE: https://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha\n✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧\nMusic: Thank you by Joakim Karud\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K26z6HSz3i0","uploadDate":"2018-02-04T20:17:22+00:00","duration":"PT2M13S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cmzrAkfHDjc/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmzrAkfHDjc","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cmzrAkfHDjc?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["4"],"prepTime":"PT5M","cookTime":"PT25M","totalTime":"PT30M","recipeIngredient":["1/2 cup oat flour (certified gluten-free if needed *, or use regular flour)","1 cup cooked chickpeas (drained if using canned)","2 tbsp coconut oil (refined if you dont want the coconut flavor)","1/3 cup nut butter such as peanut (almond or cashew, or use sunbutter to make nut-free)","2 tbsp maple syrup","3 to 4 tbsp coconut sugar or other sugar","2 tsp vanilla extract","1/8 to 1/4 tsp salt (depends on if the nut butter and chickpeas are already salted)","1/2 tsp baking powder","1/4 tsp baking soda","1/4 tsp ground cinnamon (optional)","1/2 cup vegan chocolate chips or chunks"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F / 180ºc.","name":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F / 180ºc.","url":"https://www.veganricha.com/peanut-butter-chickpea-cookie-pie/#wprm-recipe-19213-step-0-0"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Add all the ingredients except chocolate chips to a food processor.
