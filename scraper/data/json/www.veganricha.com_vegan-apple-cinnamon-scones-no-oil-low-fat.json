NoAdded refined Oil and No Coconut milk! Lower fat delicious Apple Pie Scones. \nFULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2019/09/vegan-apple-cinnamon-scones-no-oil-low-fat.html\n\n These Spiced Cinnamony Apple Scones are just perfect to use the apple bounty. They are also low-fat with no added oil and no full fat coconut milk! And yes, they are still crisp and biscuity!!\n\nI usually use full fat coconut milk for scones when making the without oil/butter and that works out really well. It is not low fat however, so I decided to experiment with other options. The 2 things tot make a good low fat scone are 1. do all possible things to keep the moisture from baking out, which can result in dry scones, 2. Chilling at several points for the biscuit like texture rather than cake or muffin texture.\n\nIn these scones, I use almond milk and apple sauce as the wet ingredients, which are frozen until some portions of the mix freezes. This mix is used to make the scone dough. The thinly sliced apples are tossed in maple syrup to keep a barrier between the apple moisture and the scone dough. The dough is topped with a liberal dusting of cinnamon and sugar. This helps seal in some of the moisture during baking. The shaped scones are chilled again before baking for a nice crisp crumb. \nSubstitution options are in the notes and in the post. \n\nMusic  Bittersweetener - Dukmaw by Epidemicsound.com\n#veganricha #veganscones #applescones #easyveganreccipes\n\nINDIAN KITCHEN:  https://veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nEVERYDAY KITCHEN: https://veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen\nFollow: \nMy blog: https://veganricha.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha","uploadDate":"2019-10-24T19:15:00+00:00","duration":"PT2M21S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/22nzyT9dV5I/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22nzyT9dV5I","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/22nzyT9dV5I?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["6"],"prepTime":"PT15M","cookTime":"PT20M","totalTime":"PT35M","recipeIngredient":["1/2 cup non dairy milk such as almond milk (,soy milk, oat milk or light coconut milk)","1 tsp lime juice","1/4 cup apple sauce","1 3/4 cup flour ((I use 1/2 cup whole wheat and 1 1/4 cup unbleached all purpose))","1/4 cup almond flour ((Nut-free: use more flour for nutfree, and use full fat coconut milk for the non dairy milk))","2 tsp baking powder","1/4 tsp baking soda","3 tbsp brown sugar or coconut sugar","1.5 tsp apple pie spice","1/2 teaspoon salt","1.25 cups thinly sliced apple (or finely chopped (very thin slices))","1.5 tbsp maple syrup","1/2 tsp vanilla extract (optional)","Optional add ins: 1/3 cup chopped pecans or walnuts","2 tbsp coconut sugar","3/4 tsp ground cinnamon"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Mix the apple sauce, lime juice and non dairy milk in a bowl and put it in the freezer for 20-25 mins.
