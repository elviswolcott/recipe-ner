Saucepan Option.\nðŸ§¡ FULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2018/05/instant-pot-cauliflower-soup-vegan.html\nðŸ§¡ MY COOKBOOK: https://veganricha.com/vrekaz\n\nThis Cauliflower Soup is Easy, Creamy, Super Quick. It takes just 5 minutes to assemble, blend, then add to the Instant Pot and done!\n\nI blend the Cauliflower before adding to the instant pot. Itâ€™s easier and faster than cooking the florets (with or without pre roasting) and using an immersion blender later. Also easier than transferring the hot soup to a blender to blend. Blend before and get the same result! Ah-ha. The blended mix when cooked under pressure cooks out the rawness completely and also adds a flavor as if the cauliflower was lightly roasted! \n\nI add some Red bell pepper for color and flavor and herbs and smoked paprika. Then fold in some cashew cream or other non dairy cream of choice to make it creamy and ready to serve. Top with favorite toppings like croutons, veggie bacon crumbles, roasted Cajun Cauliflower. Delicious and Simple!\n\n\nðŸ§¡ BUY MY COOKBOOK: http://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen \nðŸ§¡ Join the Mailing List: https://veganricha.com/mailinglist\nðŸ§¡ SUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\nðŸ’™ JOIN THE COMMUNITY:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nðŸ’™ COOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book:\nhttp://www.veganricha.com/vrekaz\nMy Amazon Store: https://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\n\n#vegan #veganism #easyveganrecipes #veganrecipes #veganricha #cooking \nMusic: This feeling by Lakey Inspired\nhttps://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired/","uploadDate":"2018-05-31T18:09:37+00:00","duration":"PT1M32S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i3OzUbsxuC8/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3OzUbsxuC8","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/i3OzUbsxuC8?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["3"],"prepTime":"PT10M","cookTime":"PT25M","totalTime":"PT35M","recipeIngredient":["1  small head of cauliflower or 1/2 a large head","1/2  small onion","4 cloves of garlic (4 small cloves or 2 large)","1/2  red bell pepper ((or use roasted red bell pepper for variation))","1.5 cup water (or veggie broth)","1/2 tsp smoked paprika","1/4 to 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes","a good dash of all spice or cinnamon ((optional, but adds great depth of flavor))","1/2 tsp dried thyme","3/4 tsp salt","1 tbsp nutritional yeast","1 cup cashew milk ( 1/3 cup cashews  (and 1 tsp flourÂ blended with 1 cup of water (use rice flour for gluten-free)))","basil/cilantro, vegan bacon, (black pepper and other toppings of choice)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Blend the first 4 ingredients with 1.5 cups of water or broth. **(see note).
