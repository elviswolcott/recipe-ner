You can either use a really wide glass (about 3.5 inches wide) or a large cookie cutter. Then just use a sharp knife to cut out the taco cups. Place each of them in a muffin cup and press them into the cup. You can either use your fingers or a smaller glass to do that. If they're too hard, you can put them on a plate and place them in the microwave for about 20 seconds to make them softer. But for me it worked without putting them in the microwave.","name":"First make the taco cups: They're actually made of tortillas.
