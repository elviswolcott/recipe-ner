When you want to cook them, take them out of the fridge and let them sit on a room temperature counter for 5 minutes first. While waiting, heat up vegetable oil on high heat. Before placing the patties in, use your thumb to gently press down on the patty (to ensure minimal shrinkage). Sear the patties until both sides are deeply charred & caramelized. If your patties are tall, I recommend covering with a lid after the first flip to ensure the whole patty is cooked through. Serve warm with your favorite Japanese curry or teriyaki sauce.","text":"Cook the Hambagu Patties.
