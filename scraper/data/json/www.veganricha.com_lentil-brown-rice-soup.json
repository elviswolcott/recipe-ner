Make it in a saucepan or Instant Pot. Serve with crackers, papadum or grilled vegan cheese sandwiches. Vegan Gluten-free Soy-free Recipe. \n\nSoak the lentils and rice. Roast up the whole spices, cook onion, ginger and garlic, add in the ground spices, some tomatoes, some veggies, then add in the drained lentils and rice, water, salt and simmer until ready. I used carrots, peppers and some of the broccoflower that was sitting in the fridge. The broccoflower or  Romanesco broccoli has an interesting flavor profile. Use any veggies of choice. Fold in some spinach or baby greens towards the end. Use mung beans or black eyed peas for variation. \n\n\nðŸ”¹ BUY MY COOKBOOK: http://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen \n\nðŸ”¹ SUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n#vegan #veganism #easyveganrecipes #veganrecipes #veganricha #cooking \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\nðŸ”¹ JOIN THE COMMUNITY:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nðŸ”¹ COOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book:\nhttp://www.veganricha.com/vrekaz\nMy Amazon Store: https://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\nMusic by Lakey Inspired - Chill Day\nhttp://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired/","uploadDate":"2018-03-25T19:33:49+00:00","duration":"PT2M1S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LJobrtRA2V0/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJobrtRA2V0","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LJobrtRA2V0?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["4"],"prepTime":"PT15M","cookTime":"PT50M","totalTime":"PT65M","recipeIngredient":["1/2 cup brown lentils","1/3 cup brown rice (uncooked rice)","1 tsp oil","1/2 tsp cumin seeds","1/2 tsp mustard seeds (optional or use 1/2 tsp ground mustard later)","1  bay leaf","1/2  medium onion (chopped)","4 cloves of garlic (finely chopped)","1 inch ginger (finely chopped)","1  green chile (chopped)","1/2 tsp turmeric","1/2 tsp paprika","1/2 tsp garam masala or curry powder (or use other spice blends like taco spice, berbere, cajun etc)","1 tsp coriander powder","1/4 tsp chipotle pepper","1/4 tsp black pepper","1.5 cups diced tomatoes","2 tsp ketchup (optional)","1 tsp lemon juice","2 cups of veggies (I used bell pepper, carrots, broccoflower(Romanesco broccoli))","3.5 cups water for pressure cooker (4 to 4.5 cups for saucepan)","3/4 tsp salt","1 cup chopped or baby spinach","lemon juice (garam masala and cayenne for garnish)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Wash and Soak the lentil and rice if you haven't yet.
