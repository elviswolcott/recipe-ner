Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. First, Penetrate the top of the bell pepper with a meat fork and use a gas stovetop or a blowtorch to blacken the surfaces of the bell peppers. The skins don't have to be completely black, just partly (Optional: Once the bell peppers are blackened, wrap them in plastic wrap to trap the heat, which creates steam that will help release the skin. After 5 minutes in the plastic wrap, unwrap them). Place the blackened bell peppers onto a parchment-lined baking tray, and roast the bell peppers until blistered and shriveled, around 15 minutes.","text":"Roast the Bell Peppers.
