It’s like having spinach and artichoke dip, but for dinner! Dairy-free, plant-based & so easy to make. I use tofu for the creamy base in this one. To make it without soy, just use my nut based spinach artichoke dip.\n\nIt’s fresh yet oh so creamy, fancy yet very easy to make any day of the week, and as tasty as can be. It’s basically the same concept as a restaurant-style spinach & artichoke dip but served as a pasta bake. I use tofu for the creamy base in this one. To make it without soy, just use my nut based spinach artichoke dip. Thin it a bit with non dairy milk, mix in the pasta and done.\n\n******MORE PASTA RECIPES FROM THE BLOG******\n\nFETTUCCINE ALFREDO WITH MUSHROOMS: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-fettuccine-alfredo-with-mushrooms-nut-free/\n\nGARLIC PASTA WITH ROASTED CAJUN CAULIFLOWER: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-garlic-pasta-roasted-cajun-cauliflower/\n\nCREAMY ROASTED RED PEPPER PASTA WITH BLACK PEPPER CHICKPEAS: https://www.veganricha.com/creamy-roasted-red-pepper-pasta-black-pepper-chickpeas/\n\nCOOKBOOKS BY RICHA HINGLE (VEGAN RICHA): https://www.veganricha.com/mybooks/\n\nConnect with me on Social Media:\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\n\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/veganricha\n\nPINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/veganricha\n\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound \n#veganricha #easyveganreecipes #pasta #spinachartichoke","uploadDate":"2020-04-01T04:45:57+00:00","duration":"PT1M47S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y7LyV6tn_80/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7LyV6tn_80","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y7LyV6tn_80?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["4"],"prepTime":"PT10M","cookTime":"PT30M","totalTime":"PT40M","recipeIngredient":["8 oz pasta (, such as shells, penne or ziti)","5 oz spinach ((thawed if frozen, finely chopped if fresh))","14 oz can of artichoke hearts drained and chopped","1 tsp oil","1/2  onion, finely chopped","3 cloves of garlic, finely chopped","7 oz firm tofu or silken tofu","1 1/4  cup non dairy milk such as almond, oat, or soy","1 tsp flour","1/4 tsp onion powder","1/4 tsp ground mustard","1/2 tsp dried basil or dill","1/2 tsp salt","2 tbsp nutritional yeast","2 tsp lemon juice","1 tsp miso","1/4 cup breadcrumbs","1/4 tsp red pepper flakes","1/2 tsp dried italian herbs such as oregano, (thyme, rosemary)","a good dash of salt"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Cook the pasta according to instruction and set aside. thaw the spinach if using frozen.
