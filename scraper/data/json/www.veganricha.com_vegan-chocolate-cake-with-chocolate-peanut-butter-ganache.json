I use smooth almond butter. Any smooth nut or seed butter should work. The cake ages really well and tastes best the next day as the ganache adds more moisture to it. Add fruit preserves like raspberry, apricot, blackberries between the layers. Do Read the Tip Section on the post to troubleshoot. \n\nSoft, Moist Fudgy Chocolate Layer Cake! Use sunbutter or coconut cream to make nut-free.
