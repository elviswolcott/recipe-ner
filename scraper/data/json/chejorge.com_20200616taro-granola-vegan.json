Spread the mixture to a one-sheet thickness on a parchment-lined baking tray. Bake for 30-33 minutes total — gently stir the granola at the half-way point (about 15 minutes in). A good way to tell when the granola is done is by feeling the middle — the middle will be the last part to dry up / harden. After baking, let the granola cool for at least 15 minutes before packing it into a glass jar.","text":"Thoroughlly combine the dry ingredients and the wet ingredients.
