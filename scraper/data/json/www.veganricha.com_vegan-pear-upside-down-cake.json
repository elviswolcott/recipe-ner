Use other fruits for variation.\nFULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2019/02/vegan-pear-upside-down-cake.html\nMY BOOKS: https://veganricha.com/books\n\nThis Upside Down Cake needs just 1 Bowl and 40 mins. A gooey caramelized top, soft delicious cake, a dollop of whipped coconut cream to serve. GF option in the notes. Made Several Times already by you all since getting posted!\n\nThe pears are sliced and arranged on the bottom of a pan. Maple syrup or brown sugar helps them caramelize during baking. Then a simple vanilla batter on top. Bake until done, then serve with some whipped coconut cream or vanilla ice cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon. Delish! Use the same method to make pineapple upside down cake or use peaches or apple.\n\nFind Us:\nMy blog: https://veganricha.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nMusic by So Long by Joakim Karud\nsoundcloud.com/joakimkarud","uploadDate":"2019-03-27T18:10:01+00:00","duration":"PT1M55S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K-RWZfWhhPA/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-RWZfWhhPA","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/K-RWZfWhhPA?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["8"],"prepTime":"PT10M","cookTime":"PT35M","totalTime":"PT45M","recipeIngredient":["2  Pears (, thinly sliced (1/4 inch thick)","3 tbsp maple syrup  (or brown sugar for more caramelized, or half of each)","3/4 cup non dairy milk (such as almond, soy)","1/4 cup pear puree or applesauce ((I usually blend up leftover pear and use it))","1 tbsp lemon juice","1/3 cup sugar","1/4 cup oil","1 tsp vanilla extract","1 tsp cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice or chai spice (or cinnamon + cardamom)","1.5 cups flour ((I use a mix of all purpose and wheat), see notes for Glutenfree)","2 tsp baking powder","1/4 tsp baking soda","1/2 tsp salt"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Line a 8 or 9 inch cake pan with parchment at the bottom.
