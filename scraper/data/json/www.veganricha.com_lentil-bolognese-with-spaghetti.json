Vegan Soyfree Nutfree Recipe. Can be gluten-free with glutenfree pasta.\n\nI use red lentils in it as they add texture but are not overly earthy like whole lentils. You can use whole brown or green lentils, chickpeas as well or skinned whole red lentils. Add a bit more herbs/flavor to preference depending on the lentils used. \n\nI serve this sauce over Spaghetti! It also goes well over zucchini pasta as well, or some mashed root veggies or mashed potato + veggie cakes (great option for gluten-free). \n\nThank you for 10k subs!! \nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ SUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ BUY MY COOKBOOK: http://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen \nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ Join the Mailing List: https://veganricha.com/mailinglist\n \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\nâœ¦ JOIN THE COMMUNITY:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nâœ¦ COOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book:\nhttp://www.veganricha.com/vrekaz\nMy Amazon Store: https://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\n\n#veganricha #easyveganrecipes #vegan #veganism #veganrecipes #cooking \nMusic: Julian Avila - Night Boy\n https://youtu.be/e4aZWH10pZA","uploadDate":"2018-08-12T19:45:38+00:00","duration":"PT1M59S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h77vuUdNryc/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h77vuUdNryc","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/h77vuUdNryc?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["3"],"prepTime":"PT10M","cookTime":"PT25M","totalTime":"PT35M","recipeIngredient":["8 to 9 oz spaghetti  (or other pasta)","1/2 cup red lentils ((split skinned quick cooking kind (masoor dal)))","1 tsp olive oil","4 oz mushroom (, chopped small)","1/2  small onion (, chopped small)","4 cloves of garlic (, finely chopped)","1/4 cup shredded carrots","3/4 tsp dried oregano or use 1/2 tbsp fresh","1 tsp dried basil or use 2 tbsp fresh","1/4 tsp thyme or rubbed sage","1/4 tsp onion powder","2 tsp nutritional yeast (optional)","16 to 18 oz low sodium marinara or pizza sauce (or use 28 oz diced tomatoes)","1 tbsp tomato paste (, optional)","1/2 tsp salt (depends on the salt content of the sauce.
