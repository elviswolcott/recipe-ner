Stove top option. Nutfree option\nðŸ’™ FULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2018/09/vegan-cauliflower-tikka-masala.html\nðŸ’™ COOKBOOK: http://www.veganricha.com/mybooks\n\nThe sauce is made in the Instant Pot before adding anything else to it, so that just the sauce can be cooked for a longer time. This helps roast the ingredients under pressure for that deep flavor profile. If you add veggies, they will overcook in the time needed for the sauce. You can pressure cook other ingredients such as tempeh, seitan, soy curls or chickpeas with the uncooked sauce ingredients. Just add them to the sauce before closing the lid. \n\nWith Cauliflower I prefer to bake it and then simmer in the cooked sauce for a few mins for best results. To cook it in the instant pot, pressure cook for just 1 minute at low pressure with the already cooked sauce or just Simmer with cooked sauce on the stove top/IP for 10-12 mins or until cauliflower is cooked to preference. \nTry it both ways to decide which you prefer, Add some chickpeas in for added protein. \n\n\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ BUY MY COOKBOOK: http://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen \nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ Join the Mailing List: https://veganricha.com/mailinglist\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ SUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\nâœ¦ JOIN THE COMMUNITY:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nâœ¦ COOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book:\nhttp://www.veganricha.com/vrekaz\nMy Amazon Store: https://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\n\n#veganricha #easyveganrecipes #vegan #veganism #veganrecipes #cooking \nMusic by Lakey Inspired\nhttps://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired/","uploadDate":"2018-09-29T18:26:04+00:00","duration":"PT1M56S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jpN3-rVtUxE/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpN3-rVtUxE","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jpN3-rVtUxE?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["6"],"prepTime":"PT10M","cookTime":"PT20M","totalTime":"PT30M","recipeIngredient":["1 tsp oil","1  small onion chopped ((I usually just process the onion, garlic, ginger and chilli to chop in aÂ  processor or a chopper))","6 cloves of garlic (finely chopped)","1 inch of ginger (finely chopped)","1  hot green chili (such as serrano or bird's eye)","1 tsp turmeric","1 tsp paprika ((combination of sweet and smoked))","1 tsp coriander powder","1/3 to 1/2 tsp cayenne","1/2 to 1 tsp Garam Masala","2 tsp dried fenugreek leaves (,plus more for garnish)","1/4 cup chopped red or green bell pepper","28 oz diced tomatoes(including juices) (or 15 oz diced + 2 ripe tomato chopped)","1/2 cup non dairy yogurt (, plain unsweetened, plain lightly sweetened also works)","3/4 tsp salt","1/4 cup non dairy cream (such as cashew, soy or coconut (optional))","smoked paprika or cayenne for garnish"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Press saute on Instant Pot.
