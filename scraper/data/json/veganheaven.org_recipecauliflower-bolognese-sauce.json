Instead of ground meat, the recipe calls for cauliflower. It's such an incredible vegetable! As all my recipes, the cauliflower Bolognese is 100 % vegan. Besides, it's also gluten-free and low in calories.","datePublished":"2017-11-07T17:14:13+00:00","image":["https://veganheaven.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Cauliflower-Bolognese-1.jpg","https://veganheaven.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Cauliflower-Bolognese-1-500x500.jpg","https://veganheaven.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Cauliflower-Bolognese-1-500x375.jpg","https://veganheaven.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Cauliflower-Bolognese-1-480x270.jpg"],"recipeYield":["2","2 servings"],"prepTime":"PT5M","cookTime":"PT10M","totalTime":"PT15M","recipeIngredient":["1  small head of cauliflower","1  onion, chopped","2  cloves of garlic, minced","3 tablespoons tomato paste","1 large can diced tomatoes (27 oz)","2 teaspoons dried Italian herbs (I used thyme,basil, rosemary, and oregano)","1 teaspoon dried oregano","1/2  cup fresh basil, chopped","salt","pepper"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Break the cauliflower into medium-sized florets and put about 1/4 of the florets in a food processor. Pulse about 2-3 times until the cauliflower looks crumbly. If you don't have a pulse function, use the lowest setting. Add the remaining florets in several rounds. You don't want to add too much at once. Alternatively, you could also use a grater but this takes much longer.","name":"Break the cauliflower into medium-sized florets and put about 1/4 of the florets in a food processor.
