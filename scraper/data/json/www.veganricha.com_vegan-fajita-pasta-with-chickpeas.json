Just a simple fusion meal with pasta, cream, taco spice roasted things added in. For a vegan version I use chickpeas/beans and peppers. \n\nThe Veggies and Chickpeas are tossed in taco spice blend and crisped. The pasta is simmered in a cashew cream sauce with tomatoes and a few flavor ingredients. A portion of veggies and chickpeas is mixed in and the rest is used to top the dish when served. Add other veggies or beans of choice or some crisped tofu or vegan meat subs, soy curls, jackfruit etc. Dreamy, spicy and fun!\nVegan Soyfree. Can be Gluten-free. To make it nut-free use my Nut-free Alfredo https://www.veganricha.com/?s=alfredo\n\n\n💙🧡 BUY MY COOKBOOK: http://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen \n💙🧡 Join the Mailing List: https://veganricha.com/mailinglist\n\n✦ SUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n \n✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧\n✦ JOIN THE COMMUNITY:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\n✦ COOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book:\nhttp://www.veganricha.com/vrekaz\nMy Amazon Store: https://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha \n✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧\n#vegan #veganism #easyveganrecipes #veganrecipes #veganricha #cooking \n\nMusic: DuDa by Gran Torino","uploadDate":"2018-05-23T21:27:29+00:00","duration":"PT1M30S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8fUYXaAmZOI/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fUYXaAmZOI","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8fUYXaAmZOI?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["4"],"prepTime":"PT10M","cookTime":"PT30M","totalTime":"PT40M","recipeIngredient":["1 tsp oil","1/2  medium onion (thinly sliced)","1  green bell pepper (thinly sliced)","1/2  red bell pepper (thinly sliced)","13.5 oz can of chickpeas (drained or 1.25 cups cooked)","1/2 tsp ground cumin","1/2 tsp garlic granules","1/2 tsp onion powder","1/2 tsp dried oregano","1/2 tsp dried basil","1 tsp smoked paprika","1/4 tsp red pepper flakes","1/4 tsp salt or to taste","6 to 8 oz pasta like fusilli or penne (, use gluten free pasta for glutenfre)","1  large juicy tomato (finely chopped)","2 tsp extra virgin olive oil","1.5 cups cashew cream (blend 1/3 cup cashews with 1.5 cups of water or unsweetened almond milk)","1/2 tsp garlic granules","1/4 tsp ground mustard","3/4 tsp or more salt","2 tbsp nutritional yeast (less or more to preference)","1 tbsp flour (, use rice flour for gluten-free (blend this into the cashew cream))","fresh or dried basil to taste"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.
