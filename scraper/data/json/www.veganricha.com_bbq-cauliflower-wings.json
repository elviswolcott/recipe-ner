There are endless ways to turn it into something addictive and I love how the florets take on a “meat-like” quality when you prepare them in certain ways. I’ve prepared cauliflower in every way imaginable but battered in a beer batter and baked until crisp and golden, then covered in a finger-licking-good spicy bbq sauce might be one of my most favorite ways.\n\n******MORE CAULIFLOWER RECIPES FROM THE BLOG******\n\nSPICY CRISPY KUNG PAO CAULIFLOWER: https://www.veganricha.com/kung-pao-cauliflower/\n\nVEGAN SPANISH RICE BOWL WITH TACO SPICE ROASTED CAULIFLOWER: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-spanish-rice-bowl-with-taco-roasted-cauliflower/\n\nSPICY BAKED CAULIFLOWER BITES WITH CELERY RANCH: https://www.veganricha.com/spicy-baked-cauliflower-bites-celery-ranch-vegan-recipe/\n\nCOOKBOOKS BY RICHA HINGLE (VEGAN RICHA): https://www.veganricha.com/mybooks/\n\nConnect with me on Social Media:\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\n\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/veganricha\n\nPINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/veganricha\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound \n\n#cauliflowerwings #veganappetizer #veganricha #easyveganrecipes","uploadDate":"2021-09-05T16:14:00+00:00","duration":"PT56S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BPKiiOaOS70/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPKiiOaOS70","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BPKiiOaOS70?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["4"],"prepTime":"PT15M","cookTime":"PT30M","totalTime":"PT40M","recipeIngredient":["1/2 cup rice flour","2 tablespoons tapioca starch  (or corn starch)","1/4 teaspoon salt","1/4 teaspoon garlic powder","1/2 teaspoon black pepper","1/2 teaspoon baking powder","2 teaspoons bbq seasoning  (or use 1 teaspoon paprika, 1/4 teaspoon onion powder, and 1/4 teaspoon each of oregano, thyme, and parsley)","1/2 cup of beer or use neutral club soda (or use water )","1 tsp oil","4 cups cauliflower florets ( or 1 small head of cauliflower chopped into florets)","1/2 cup bbq sauce (or more )","2 teaspoons hot sauce"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"In a bowl, add all the dry ingredients and mix well.
