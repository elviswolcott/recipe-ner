Heat up a wok or a pan on high heat and swirl 2 tablespoons of oil around to even coat. Note: 2 tablespoons of oil seems like a lot, but ample oil is essential for the noodles to not stick together. Start by frying garlic and chiles until aromatic, about 30 seconds. Add Seitan \"Chicken\" and fry until lightly brown & charred, about 3-4 minutes. Add Chinese Broccoli (Gai Lan), followed by rice noodles and the prepared sauce. Note: drizzle the sauce down the sides of the wok for maximum flavor as it instantly boils. Gently toss and mix everything together by doing a scooping motion with your spatula. Continue to cook and allow everything to sit in the hot wok occasionally, so as to develop charred flavors. Once desired done-ness & flavor is reached, remove from the wok or pan. Enjoy warm.","text":"Make the Pad See Ew.
