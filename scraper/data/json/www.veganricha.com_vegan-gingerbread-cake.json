Ginger, candied ginger, dark chocolate add a pleasing bitter combination with gingerbread spices.\nFULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2018/12/vegan-chocolate-gingerbread-cake.html\n\nGinger and Chocolate in baked goods work very well together in the cold season. This loaf has cocoa, fresh ginger and gingerbread spices in the wet ingredients and candied ginger and chopped up chocolate in the dry. It bakes into a slightly dense pound cake like loaf that is best served warm. If storing for longer, warm before serving so that the chocolate can melt a bit and get gooey and delicious. Its almost like a gingerbread brownie! Serve as a snack or top with whipped coconut cream or a chocolate frosting for dessert. \n\n#chocolategingerbread #veganricha #easyveganrecipes #vegancake #chocolategingerbreadcake\nMusic: Milky Way by Joakim Karud","uploadDate":"2019-12-10T17:00:01+00:00","duration":"PT1M37S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AnST9lDkaFE/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnST9lDkaFE","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AnST9lDkaFE?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["8"],"prepTime":"PT20M","cookTime":"PT35M","totalTime":"PT55M","recipeIngredient":["1 cup Spelt flour (or use whole wheat pastry flour or other flour)","1/2 cup unbleached white flour","1.5 teaspoon baking powder","1/4 teaspoon baking soda","2 Tbsp candied ginger (chopped small)","1 tsp cinnamon","1/2 tsp ground ginger (use more if omitting fresh ginger)","1/4 tsp ground cloves","2 Tbsp chopped walnuts or other nuts","2 to 3 Tbsp vegan mini chocolate chips like Enjoy life (or use nuts or seeds)","2 Tablespoons chia seeds or flax seed meal","1 Tbsp candied ginger","3/4 cup non dairy milk like almond or coconut","1/2 cup + 2 Tbsp coconut sugar or ground raw sugar","2 Tbsp oil","1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt","2 tsp vanilla extract","2 Tbsp molasses (use light molasses if you like a lighter molasses flavor)","1 Tbsp fresh ginger (minced or grated)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Preheat the oven to 365 deg F / 180ºc.","name":"Preheat the oven to 365 deg F / 180ºc.","url":"https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-gingerbread-cake/#wprm-recipe-26627-step-0-0"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"In a bowl, whisk all dry ingredients except walnuts and chocolate chips, and keep aside.","name":"In a bowl, whisk all dry ingredients except walnuts and chocolate chips, and keep aside.","url":"https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-gingerbread-cake/#wprm-recipe-26627-step-0-1"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Grind the chia seeds with a Tbsp of candied ginger.
