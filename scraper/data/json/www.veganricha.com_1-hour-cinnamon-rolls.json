Aquafaba! Aquafaba is the liquid from a can of chickpeas (chickpea brine), that can be used to make meringues and can be used as egg substitute in some vegan baking. You can make aquafaba at home too by pressure cooking dried chickpeas in water. The viscous water remaining after the chickpeas are cooked, is aquafaba and can be frozen for future use. \n\nIn these cinnamon rolls, aquafaba adds moisture to the rolls and also helps them rise quicker and rise more so you can get away with 1 rise Quicker Rolls. \n\nIf you have time, use the 2 rise method as that makes the rolls even more fluffy and soft. Especially if you are using combination flours or whole grain flours, as those flours need more extra moisture and airy yeast action to keep them softer and not dense. \nUse frosting of choice. I like a cashew cream cheese style that is not all sugar :).
