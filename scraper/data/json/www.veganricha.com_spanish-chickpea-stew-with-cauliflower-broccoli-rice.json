If you already have some rice to serve it over, then this is a One Pot meal and ready within 30 minutes!\n\nI serve the stew over rice, or Cauliflower rice, or Broccoli + cauliflower rice. Cauliflower and Broccoli are riced in a processor. They are flavored with toasted cumin, salt and lemon and steamed to make a fluffy al dente cooked mixture. The Stew uses onion and tomato base with bay leaves, paprika and oregano for flavor. Change up the beans, add some veggies or greens for variation. \nVegan Gluten-free Nut-free Grain-free Soy-free Recipe.\n\n\n❤️ BUY MY COOKBOOK Vegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen - 140 Recipes, 100+ Easy Meals, Awesome Sauces, & some Breakfast and Dessert. https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen \n\n✦ SUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧\n✦ JOIN THE COMMUNITY:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\n✦ COOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen - Epic Anytime Recipes with a World of Flavor:\nhttp://www.veganricha.com/vrekaz\nMY AMAZON STORE: https://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha \n✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧\n\n#vegan #veganism #easyveganrecipes #veganrecipes #veganricha #cooking \nMusic: 5 min Call by Lakey Inspired\nhttps://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired/","uploadDate":"2018-04-20T17:54:28+00:00","duration":"PT1M52S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KHAZ8ZULzCo/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHAZ8ZULzCo","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KHAZ8ZULzCo?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["3"],"prepTime":"PT10M","cookTime":"PT30M","totalTime":"PT40M","recipeIngredient":["1 tsp oil","1/2 cup chopped onion","3 cloves garlic (finely chopped)","12  oz of canned diced tomatoes (unsalted, or 2 large juicy tomatoes)","1 inch ginger","3/4 tsp paprika (smoky or a combination of sweet and smoky)","1/2 to 3/4 tsp cumin","1/4 tsp or more cayenne","a generous dash of black pepper","1  bay leaf","1/2 tsp dried oregano","1 15 oz can chickpeas (drained or 1.5 cups cooked chickpeas)","1.5 cups vegetables chopped small  (such as cauliflower, carrots, zucchini, green or red bell pepper)","1 cup or more water","1/2 to 3/4 tsp salt (depends on if the chickpeas are already salted)","1/2 tsp sugar  (or maple syrup or other sweetener)","1.5 cups cauliflower florets or 1 cup grated or shredded (heaped)","1.5 cups broccoli florets or 1 scant cup shredded","1/2 tsp oil","1/4 tsp cumin seeds","1/4 tsp or more salt","1/4 tsp garlic","1  dash of cayenne (optional)","a good dash of lemon juice"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToSection","name":"Chickpea Stew:","itemListElement":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat.
