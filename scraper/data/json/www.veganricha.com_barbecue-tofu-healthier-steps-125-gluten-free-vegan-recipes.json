I have cooked this dish more than any other and it is always a winner. Barbara came to visit our family several times. She was quiet and sweet and didn’t say too much. She would love to visit because I lived in the countryside, where it was peaceful and quiet. While she stayed with our family, she didn’t ask for much; she was content and happy and enjoyed just being with us. She would spend hours walking with Devannah and me when Devannah was 6 years old. At the time, I didn’t know Barbara had terminal cancer. I found out that at one point she was an owner of a vegan restaurant and had years of experience as a chef.","datePublished":"2015-01-20T11:21:34+00:00","image":["https://www.veganricha.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/healthier-steps-6138-300x449-1.jpg","https://www.veganricha.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/healthier-steps-6138-300x449-1-300x375.jpg","https://www.veganricha.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/healthier-steps-6138-300x449-1-300x270.jpg"],"recipeYield":["4"],"prepTime":"PT20M","cookTime":"PT40M","totalTime":"PT60M","recipeIngredient":["Batter","1 pound extra firm tofu, drained and pressed","¼ cup creamy peanut butter or tahini paste","1 tablespoon olive oil","1 teaspoon onion powder","½ teaspoon garlic powder","1 teaspoon nutritional yeast flakes (optional)","½ teaspoon sea salt","Pinch cumin","Barbecue Sauce","2 teaspoons olive oil or 2 tablespoons water","¼ cup minced onion","1 clove garlic","28 ounces tomato puree or sauce","¼ cup maple syrup","2 tablespoons coconut palm sugar","1 tablespoon pomegranate molasses","1 tablespoon parsley flakes","2 tablespoons Bragg’s liquid aminos or coconut aminos","¼ teaspoon sesame oil (optional)","Sea salt to taste"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"For barbecue sauce: In a medium saucepan, heat oil or water on medium heat.
