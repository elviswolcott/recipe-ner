This Chickpea Flour Pizza Crust is gluten-free, grain-free! Vegan Socca Pizza with veggies and chimichurri or pesto. GF soyfree Recipe. Easily made nut-free.\nFULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2019/07/socca-pizza-with-pesto-and-mushrooms.html\nIndian Kitchen Cookbook: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nEveryday Kitchen Cookbook: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen\n\nSocca, a type of thin unleavened pancake, flatbread made with chickpea flour, is naturally gluten-free and grain-free and can easily be used as a pizza base. The Socca Bread needs just 2 main ingredients, chickpea flour and water. Just mix, and cook a bit on the skillet or bake. Then add your favorite toppings and bake again.\n\nI top it with pesto or chimichurri and veggies. You can also add some vegan cheese if you like. Add other toppings such as microgreens before serving. Easy, protein filled and delicious!\n\nFollow: My blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/","uploadDate":"2019-10-02T06:00:02+00:00","duration":"PT1M37S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/htHTd_B-Hek/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htHTd_B-Hek","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/htHTd_B-Hek?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["4"],"prepTime":"PT15M","cookTime":"PT30M","totalTime":"PT50M","recipeIngredient":["1 cup chickpea flour (garbanzo bean flour)","1/2 tsp salt","1/4 tsp pepper flakes or to taste","1/2 tsp rosemary","1 cup water","1  Recipe chimichurri sauce","Or 1 Recipe Vegan Pesto ((use chimichurri for nutfree))","3 oz sliced mushrooms","1 tsp olive oil","Other veggies such as sliced bell pepper (sun dried tomato, sliced jalapeno, zucchini or olives)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Socca Pizza Crust: Mix all the dry ingredients in a bowl until well mixed.","name":"Socca Pizza Crust: Mix all the dry ingredients in a bowl until well mixed.","url":"https://www.veganricha.com/socca-pizza-with-pesto-and-mushrooms/#wprm-recipe-31450-step-0-0"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Add 3/4 cup water and mix (use a whisk for faster mixing), Add more water to make a thick smooth batter, lump free batter that is just a tad bit thinner than pancake batter.
