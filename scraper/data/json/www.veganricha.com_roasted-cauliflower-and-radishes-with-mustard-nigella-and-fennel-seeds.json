{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Recipe","name":"Roasted Cauliflower and Radish with Mustard, Nigella, and Fennel Seeds","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Vegan Richa"},"description":"This recipe is super-easy and addictive. Fennel and nigella seeds give the vegetables an Indian pickle flavor profile. Roasted cauliflower is always a hit, and here you can try roasted radish as well. I like to use baby red radishes because they make the dish look so colorful. Serve this with Northeastern dals such as odia dal or cholar dal, and with spicy curries that use fennel seeds.
