Caramelizing the bananas adds a nice depth of flavor and  keeps the scones from getting too soft like a cake.","name":"Caramelize the bananas: slice the bananas and add to the skillet, add 2 tbsp of brown sugar and half the cinnamon and 1 tsp of coconut milk, mix and cook over medium heat until banana starts to get golden.  This can take 5 to 6 minutes.
