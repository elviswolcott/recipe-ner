No soy! 10 mins active time.\nFULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2016/04/chickpea-flour-tofu.html\nMY BOOKS: https://veganricha.com/books\n\n\nMake your own Chickpea flour Tofu. 10 min Non soy tofu made with Chickpea flour or Besan / gram flour.  Vegan Gluten-free Soy-free Grainfree Nut-free Recipe\n\nBurmese (chickpea) tofu is made by cooking split pea flour or chickpea flour in several ways. I make my chickpea tofu with chickpea flour and with less liquid so it is a sturdier, and is a quick version of Burmese tofu. This recipe makes about 2.5 to 3 cups cubed tofu which can be stored for a few days refrigerated.\n\nThe tofu can also be made with Chickpea flour (which is ground garbanzo beans (white chickpeas), pure besan / gram flour (which is flour of brown chickpeas (kala chana) or split brown chickpeas (chana dal)), or mixed flour besan which can have 2 different types of chickpea / split pea flour.  Each of the flours need different amounts of liquid. Besan (gram flour) is also ground finer than white chickpea flour. Depending on the flour used, the resulting tofu cubes might be soft or firm. Use less water for firmer and more water for softer chickpea tofu. \n\nChickpea flour is mixed with water to form a smooth batter. The batter thickens into a thick custard like consistency which sets and can be easily sliced. \n\nMusic: Serini- summer is over\n\nFind us:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\n#veganricha #easyveganrecipes #vegan #veganism #veganrecipes #cooking #chickpeatofu #chickpeaflourtofu","uploadDate":"2019-01-15T01:31:56+00:00","duration":"PT1M25S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nTETZn4sXtQ/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTETZn4sXtQ","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nTETZn4sXtQ?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["4","4 servings"],"prepTime":"PT5M","cookTime":"PT10M","totalTime":"PT15M","recipeIngredient":["1 cup chickpea flour/ garbanzo bean flour (use 1 1/4 cup besan/ gram flour)","1/2-3/4 tsp salt","1/4 tsp garlic powder","1/4 tsp turmeric (optional, for color)","1/4 tsp cumin or garam masala (optional)","1 3/4 cup water"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Grease a bread pan or line with parchment and keep ready.
