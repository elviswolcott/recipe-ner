Saucepan Option. \nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ FULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2018/07/instant-pot-black-eyed-peas-rice-pulao-lobia-pulao.html\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ MY COOKBOOKS: https://veganricha.com/mybooks\n\nI love beans + rice and I love roasted peanuts or other nuts in pulao(spiced rice). This version uses black eyed peas and brown rice and is a mix of a few pulao styles across Indian cuisine. Add whichever spices you have (other cuisines blends such as Jamaican curry, cajun work too!), and veggies of choice.\n\nBlack eyed Peas (Lobia/Chawli/Raungi) are often ignored in favor of various beans, chickpeas or split peas. But these beans are so smooth and soft and have their own fantastic flavor. Try this Black Eyes Peas and Rice Pulao. Glutenfree, Soyfree, Easily Nutfree.
