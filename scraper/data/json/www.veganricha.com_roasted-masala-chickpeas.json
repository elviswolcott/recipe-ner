{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Recipe","name":"Roasted Masala Chickpeas","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Vegan Richa"},"description":"These roasted chickpeas are an addictive snack to munch on. The flours added to the chickpeas ensure that the spices and oil stick to the chickpeas. The result is a perfectly crispy snack. The chickpeas can also be served as a small salad, with chopped onion and tomato, cilantro, and a good dash of lemon juice. Bake the chickpeas longer for a crispier, crunchier result. Bake a minute or so less for a softer inside. Use other spices of choice Gluten-free, Soy-free, Nut-free, Vegan","datePublished":"2015-06-21T12:22:40+00:00","image":["https://www.veganricha.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/spicy-chickpeas-1142-002-1.jpg","https://www.veganricha.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/spicy-chickpeas-1142-002-1-500x500.jpg","https://www.veganricha.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/spicy-chickpeas-1142-002-1-500x375.jpg","https://www.veganricha.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/spicy-chickpeas-1142-002-1-480x270.jpg"],"recipeYield":["4"],"prepTime":"PT10M","cookTime":"PT30M","totalTime":"PT40M","recipeIngredient":["30 oz canned chickpeas ( or 3 cups cooked chickpeas)","1 to 2 tablespoons safflower  (or other neutral oil)","1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon salt","1 1/2 teaspoons garam masala","1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder","1/2 to 1 teaspoon cayenne or to taste","1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric","1 teaspoon dry mango powder (amchur or chaat masala, or use 1/4 teaspoon kala namak)","3 tablespoons chickpea flour","2 to 3 tablespoons rice flour"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Preheat the oven to 425°F / 220ºc.","name":"Preheat the oven to 425°F / 220ºc.","url":"https://www.veganricha.com/roasted-masala-chickpeas/#wprm-recipe-27075-step-0-0"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Drain and rinse the chickpeas if using canned.
