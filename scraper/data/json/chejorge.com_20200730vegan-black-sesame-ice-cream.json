In a sauce-pan, combine non-dairy milk and sugar. Bring to a boil and let simmer to reduce by two-thirds, around 30 minutes.  Note: Don't let the milk boil too rapidly! At the end of the reduction, the consistency should resemble regular condensed milk, but note that it will get a little less runny when cooled. Let cool for at least 2 hours in the fridge.

Pour the coconut cream into a large bowl (The can(s) of coconut cream is chilled in the fridge overnight for the best separation between water & cream, as you only want the cream). Whip the coconut cream until stiff peaks form. Whipping is much easier when the cream is cold — place it in the freezer for a few minutes if the cream is not whipping up. Once stiff peaks form, add in the condensed milk, black sesame paste (homemade instructions HERE), black sesame seeds, vanilla extract, and vodka*. Gently fold everything together with a spatula. Quickly pour the mixture into a freezer-safe airtight container. Chill in the freezer for at least 5 hours, or until solid.","text":"Make the Black Sesame Ice Cream.
