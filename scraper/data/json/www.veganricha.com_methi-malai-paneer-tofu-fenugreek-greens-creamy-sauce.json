Tofu and Fenugreek/Greens in Creamy Sauce. \nFULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2017/07/methi-malai-paneer-tofu-fenugreek-greens-creamy-sauce.html\nMY BOOKS: https://veganricha.com/books\n\nEasy Weeknight Restaurant style Indian entree. Serve over Naan or rice. Vegan Gluten-free Recipe. Soy-free Nut-free option. Methi Malai Matar (Fenugreek/Greens and peas in creamy white sauce), Methi malai paneer (fenugreek and Paneer cheese cubes in creamy sauce) are some Mughlai dishes you might find in some Indian restaurants. The dishes use malai or dairy cream and cheese or other dairy ingredients. Its like a spiced up Spinach dip, with lots of complex flavor!\n\nBut this version is free of all that, tastes amazing, and comes together quickly as well. Fresh fenugreek leaves are a favorite to use in the dish when in season. If you find some then definitely use them fresh, else use dried fenugreek with greens of choice. Serve with hot garlic Naan or rice/grains or make a bowl with roasted veggies, add to wraps or on a pizza.\n\n\nMusic: Serini- summer is over\n\nFind us:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\n#veganricha #easyveganrecipes #vegan #veganism #veganrecipes #cooking #methimalaitofu #methimalaipaneer #indianmethimalai","uploadDate":"2019-04-11T15:00:07+00:00","duration":"PT1M25S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xvEJ2x-j10M/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvEJ2x-j10M","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xvEJ2x-j10M?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["3"],"prepTime":"PT10M","cookTime":"PT35M","totalTime":"PT45M","recipeIngredient":["12  oz firm Tofu","1 tsp oil","2 tbsp cornstarch","1 tsp garam masala","1 tbsp nutritional yeast","1/4 tsp garlic powder","1/4 tsp salt","1 tsp oil","1/4 tsp cumin seeds","2  cloves","2 inch cinnamon stick (or add a heaping 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon later with the garam masala)","1  medium onion (finely chopped)","5 cloves of garlic (finely chopped)","1 inch ginger (finely chopped)","1  hot green chile (chopped)","1/3 cup tomato puree  (or puree 1/2 heaping cup chopped tomato with a tbsp of water)","1/4 cup raw cashews (soaked in warm water for 15 minutes)","1 cup water  (or non dairy milk)","1/2 tsp garam masala","1/4 tsp turmeric","1/4 tsp or more cayenne","1 cup fresh Fenugreek","3/4 tsp salt or more to taste","1/2 tsp sugar or more to taste"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Press the tofu for 10 minutes to remove excess moisture, then cube into small even pieces.","name":"Press the tofu for 10 minutes to remove excess moisture, then cube into small even pieces.","url":"https://www.veganricha.com/methi-malai-paneer-tofu-fenugreek-greens-creamy-sauce/#wprm-recipe-27768-step-0-0"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Toss pressed tofu in oil.
