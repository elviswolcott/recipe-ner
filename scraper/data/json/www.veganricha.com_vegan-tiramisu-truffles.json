Repeat for all of the mixture. Chill these balls for 15 minutes so that the chocolate sets and hardens a little bit. You can just put them in the freezer for faster setting. Then dip them in the chocolate again. The double-dipping creates a thick fudgy chocolate coating. You don't have to make them look pretty or even, because we are going to eventually roll them up. So however the shape is, just coat them in the thick chocolate mixture, and set them on parchment, and let them chill for another 15-20 minutes, or until they are nicely set.","name":"Take scoops of the cheese mixture and make it into half-inch balls, then coat these balls in the melted chocolate mixture and set it on parchment.
