Heat 1-2 tablespoons of oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Note: you can also use a non-stick pan with egg molds/rings. Once the oil is hot, carefully spoon in 2.5-3 tablespoons of the egg white component. Immediately turn the heat down (to low heat) and cover to cook for about 1 minute. Once the whites are nearly set, spoon on ~1 tablespoon of the egg yolk component. Cover again and cook until the whites are completely set and the edges are golden-brown & crispy. Note: Heat control is key here, you might burn the whites if you're not careful! Once done, carefully transfer them onto paper towel to blot off excess oil. This recipe yields about 6-7 vegan fried eggs.","text":"Make the Vegan Fried Eggs. Heat 1-2 tablespoons of oil in a wok over medium-high heat.

Start by chopping up kimchi into bite-sized pieces. Note: I recommend using kitchen shears and cutting the kimchi in a bowl, so as to avoid staining & contain all the juices.

Mix well to combine and set aside. For the scallions, remember to separate the white and green parts.","text":"Prepare Mise En Place. Start by chopping up kimchi into bite-sized pieces.

Break the rice up and add the prepared sauce (kimchi juice, gochujang, and toasted sesame oil). Toss everything to combine and stir rigorously to ensure there are no big lumps of rice.
