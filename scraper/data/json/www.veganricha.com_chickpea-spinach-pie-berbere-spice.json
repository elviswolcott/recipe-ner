Use up those canned or cooked chickpeas or lentils, cook them up with the spices, onion and spinach. Make your own Ethiopian Berbere blend (see recipe on post) or use others. Fill up a thawed puff pastry sheets (many are accidentally vegan), seal and bake! \n\nThe idea for this came about when I was thinking about making something like a Spanakopita but simpler. You can make one whole pie or small hand pies. Use any spices of choice or use the from scratch spice blends from my Everyday Kitchen book (Baharat (so good), Shawarma, Garam masala etc). Or use just herbs, a combination of thyme, sage and oregano + nooch. Add some tofu or almond ricotta for variation. Vegan Soy-free Nut-free Recipe.\nTo make it Gluten-free, use a gluten-free pie crust and bake the filling into a pie or make hand pies. \n\n\nðŸ”— BUY VEGAN RICHA'S EVERYDAY KITCHEN COOKBOOK: http://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen \n\nâœ¦ SUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\nâœ¦ JOIN THE COMMUNITY:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nâœ¦ COOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book: https://www.veganricha.com/vrekaz\nMY AMAZON STORE: https://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\n#vegan #veganism #easyveganrecipes #veganrecipes #veganricha #cooking \nMusic: Find a Way by LAkey Inspired\nhttp://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired/","uploadDate":"2018-04-03T18:08:52+00:00","duration":"PT1M58S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ea7IQqXHXQg/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea7IQqXHXQg","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ea7IQqXHXQg?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["9"],"prepTime":"PT10M","cookTime":"PT35M","totalTime":"PT45M","recipeIngredient":["2  vegan puff pastry sheets","1 tsp olive oil","1  small red onion (, thinly sliced or chopped)","5 cloves of garlic (, finely chopped)","3/4 tsp ground cumin  (, or 1/2 tsp cumin + 1/2 tsp coriander)","1 to 2 tsp berbere spice blend","1/4 to 1/2 tsp cayenne or pepper flakes","a good dash of black pepper","15  oz can chickpeas (, or 1.5 cups cooked)","1/2 tsp salt (, less or more depending on if the chickpeas are salted)","5 to 6 oz spinach","1  bunchÂ Â of cilantro (chopped, or use more spinach)","1/2 cup non dairy milk ( + 1 tbsp flour)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Remove the Puff pastry sheets from the freezer and cover and let them rest at room temperature.
