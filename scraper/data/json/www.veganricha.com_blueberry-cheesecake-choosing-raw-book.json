{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Recipe","name":"Vegan Blueberry Cheesecake","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Gena Hemshaw"},"description":"If you think authentic cheesecake flavor is impossible without the cheese, think again. Raw cheesecake happens to be one of the most authentic tasting raw desserts, thanks to the magical combination of cashews and coconut oil. The cheesecake is easier to prepare in a high-speed blender than a food processor, but the processor can work if that’s what you have. Just be sure to soak your cashews overnight! If you don’t have cashews, macadamia nuts are a perfect substitute.","datePublished":"2014-07-03T15:00:00+00:00","image":["https://www.veganricha.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/reviews-2434.jpg","https://www.veganricha.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/reviews-2434-500x500.jpg","https://www.veganricha.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/reviews-2434-500x375.jpg","https://www.veganricha.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/reviews-2434-480x270.jpg"],"recipeYield":["12"],"prepTime":"PT15M","cookTime":"PT15M","totalTime":"PT30M","recipeIngredient":["1 1/2 cups almonds","Pinch sea salt","2 cups pitted Medjool dates","3 cups cashews (soaked in water overnight and drained)","1/4 tsp  sea salt","2/3 cup  melted coconut oil","Seeds of 1 vanilla bean (or 2 teaspoons vanilla extract)","1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice","1/2 cup agave nectar","2 cups blueberries","2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice","2 tablespoons agave nectar or pure maple syrup"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Place the almonds and sea salt in a food processor and grind roughly.
