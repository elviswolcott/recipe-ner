No added refined sugar. GF option\n💙 FULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2018/05/vegan-lemon-cake-with-cream-cheese-frosting.html\n💙 MY COOKBOOK: https://veganricha.com/vrekaz\n\nThis Cake is Zesty, lemony, Soft, Moist, Sumerry and everything I want in a Lemon Cake. A super easy Cake with loads of lemon juice and zest covered with 4 ingredient vegan cream cheese frosting. I use kite cream cheese or a cashew based home made cream cheese. A simple glaze with a few tsp lemon juice and half cup powdered sugar will work wonderfully as well. \n\nIt takes just a few minutes to put together and then it is the excruciating wait time to bake, cool and frost! All maple syrup, no refined sugar in the cake or the frosting. The batter can be baked into cupcakes, baked donuts or a loaf like my Cinnamon Swirl Loaf which is getting made every day on Instagram! \nMore Cakes: https://www.veganricha.com/?s=cake\nGluten-free Cakes and Baking: https://www.veganricha.com/category/gluten-free/gluten-free-baking\n\n\n💙🧡 BUY MY COOKBOOKS: http://www.veganricha.com/mybooks\n💙🧡 Join the Mailing List: https://veganricha.com/mailinglist\n\n💙 SUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n \n✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧\n💙 JOIN THE COMMUNITY:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\n💙 COOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book:\nhttps://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen\nMy Amazon Store: https://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha \n✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧\n#vegan #veganism #easyveganrecipes #veganrecipes #veganricha #cooking \n\nMusic: Bensound - Energy","uploadDate":"2018-06-05T15:30:01+00:00","duration":"PT1M38S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oFejpcnGOO4/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFejpcnGOO4","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oFejpcnGOO4?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["9"],"prepTime":"PT10M","cookTime":"PT35M","totalTime":"PT45M","recipeIngredient":["1/2 cup maple syrup ((add 1 tbsp sugar for sweeter))","1/3 cup lemon juice (( 1 tbsp more if using whole grain flours))","1/4 cup oil","1/4 cup water ( or non dairy milk)","1/4 tsp vanilla extract (optional)","1 1/2 cup flour ","2 tbsp almond flour or meal (, or use more flour to make it nutfree)","1.5 tsp baking powder","1/4 tsp baking soda","1/3 tsp salt","1/8 tsp turmeric (for color, optional)","zest of 1/2 to 1 lemon depending on the size of the lemon and your preference of lemonyness","6 oz vegan cream cheese ((I use kite hill plain almond cream cheese, see notes to make your own cashew cream cheese))","1/4 cup maple syrup","1 tbsp lemon juice","a pinch of salt","1 - 2 tbsp powdered sugar and 2 drops of vanilla if needed"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
