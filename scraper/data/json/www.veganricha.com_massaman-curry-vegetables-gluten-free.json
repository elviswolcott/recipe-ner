Vegan Gluten-free Soy-free Recipe. No Tofu.\n\nMassaman curry is a favorite in the house right after green and red curries. Massaman has a Malay influence on the curry and hence has spices.\nThe curry gets even more delicious the next day when the spices have had time to sit and infuse a more flavor. Add tofu or seitan or chickpeas to this curry for variations. \n\nThis Recipe is also in my Everyday Kitchen Cookbook. \nBUY MY COOKBOOK: http://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen \n\n\nSUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n#vegan #veganism #easyveganrecipes #veganrecipes #veganricha #cooking \n✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧\nFOLLOW US:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nCOOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book:\nhttp://www.veganricha.com/vrekaz\n\nMY AMAZON STORE: https://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha\n✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧\n\nMusic: Life is\nBy Cosimo Fogg 201 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MXUHYGvBVY\nLife Is by Cosimo Fogg (201) https://soundcloud.com/cosimo-fogg\nCreative Commons — Attribution 3.0 \nMusic promoted by Audio Library https://youtu.be/9MXUHYGvBVY","uploadDate":"2018-02-15T18:24:27+00:00","duration":"PT2M5S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hVUY4mGbVxU/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://youtu.be/hVUY4mGbVxU","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hVUY4mGbVxU?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["2"],"prepTime":"PT20M","cookTime":"PT30M","totalTime":"PT50M","recipeIngredient":["2 tsp coconut oil  (or organic canola oil)","1/2  loaded cup sliced onion (red or white)","2 tsp minced ginger","3 cloves of garlic minced","2 cups cauliflower florets (chopped small, about 1.5 inch)","1/2  red bell pepper (chopped)","1/2 -3/4 cup chopped green beans","1/2 cup sliced carrots","2 Tbsp red curry paste (I use thai kitchen)","1/4 tsp cumin powder","1/4 tsp cinnamon powder","1/4 tsp cardamom powder","1/8 tsp cloves powder","1/4 tsp cayenne","1/4 tsp crushed fennel seeds (or use ground star anise)","3 Tbsp peanut butter or almond butter (or use a 1/4 cup roasted peanuts and blend to a paste with a little water or oil)","1 Tbsp raw sugar","1/2 tsp salt (divided)","1/2 tsp tamarind Concentrate","1 cup coconut milk","3/4 cup water"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"In a large pan, add oil and heat at medium heat.
