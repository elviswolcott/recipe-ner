In a small bowl, combine all of the ingredients for the marinade. Fill the tofu and the marinade into a ziploc bag and store it overnight in the fridge. If you don't have much time, you could also get away with marinating it for about 4 hours. But it's definitely better if you marinate it for a longer time.
