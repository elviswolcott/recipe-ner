Serve with crispy roasted smoky bacon-ish tofu.\n\nThis easy vegan Butternut Squash Carbonara is the perfect fall and winter dinner. It’s a creamy spin on my popular Pumpkin Sage pasta and trust me, it will likely become a staple you will make again and again. Traditional Italian Carbonara Sauce is made from parmesan cheese and egg yolks.  This vegan version is just as deliciously rich and creamy (even without egg or dairy), thanks to cashew cream, and even quite cheesy thanks to nutritional yeast, and a hearty thanks to miso paste and fresh sage!\n\n******MORE DINNER RECIPES FROM THE BLOG******\n\nPUMPKIN SAGE PASTA: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-pumpkin-sage-pasta/\n\nPUMPKIN MAC AND CHEESE BAKE: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-pumpkin-mac-and-cheese-bake/\n\nJALAPENO CHILI CORNBREAD CASSEROLE: https://www.veganricha.com/jalapeno-chili-cornbread-casserole/\n\nCOOKBOOKS BY RICHA HINGLE (VEGAN RICHA): https://www.veganricha.com/mybooks/\n\nConnect with me on Social Media:\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\n\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/veganricha\n\nPINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/veganricha\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound \n\n#VeganCarbonara #easyVeganDinner #VeganRichaRecipes #easyVeganRecipes","uploadDate":"2020-11-18T03:55:57+00:00","duration":"PT1M32S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-3A9ZtwbA7c/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3A9ZtwbA7c","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-3A9ZtwbA7c?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["2"],"prepTime":"PT10M","cookTime":"PT65M","totalTime":"PT75M","recipeIngredient":["2 tsp olive oil","1/4 cup finely chopped onions","2  garlic cloves (minced)","1/4 tsp pepper flakes","1 tbsp fresh sage","1/2 tsp salt","1/4 tsp black pepper","1/3 cup  cashews","2 tbsp nutritional yeast","1 1/4 cup veggie broth or water","2 cups butternut squash (cubed )","2 tsp lemon juice","1/2 tsp miso paste  (optional)","8 oz fettuccine","7 oz  firm or extra firm tofu (pressed for at least 15 minutes, and then drained and cubed into 1/4th inch cubes)","2 tsp oil","1.5 tbsp soy sauce","1.5 tsp smoked paprika","1/2 tsp garlic powder","1/2 tsp  sugar ( or maple syrup)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Add oil to a skillet over medium heat, add in the onion and garlic and cook until transluent.","name":"Add oil to a skillet over medium heat, add in the onion and garlic and cook until transluent.","url":"https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-butternut-squash-carbonara/#wprm-recipe-33880-step-0-0"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Add in the sage and pepper flakes and mix in.
