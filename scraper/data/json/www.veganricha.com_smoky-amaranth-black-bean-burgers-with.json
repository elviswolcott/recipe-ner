Add the cooked amaranth and oil and give everything a good mix. Mash a bit to mash the black beans. Taste for spice and salt. Now add the brown rice flour to the mixture to make it less sticky. Add less or more just enough to handle the mixture without it being a sticky mess. Use a cookie cutter and press a good dollop of the mix into and through it to shape the patties on parchment lined baking sheet. Even them out and brush a little oil on top.(optional). I used 2 inch cookie cutter as my buns were 2.5 inches. and got 6 patties.","name":"Back to patties: Chop up the red pepper and chili, In a bowl, add black beans, peppers, salt and spices.
