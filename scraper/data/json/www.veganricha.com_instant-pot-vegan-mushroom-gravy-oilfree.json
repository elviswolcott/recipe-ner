No Oil 1 Pot Gluten free Mushroom Gravy made in a pressure cooker or saucepan. Freezer friendly. 30 Mins. \nFULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2018/11/instant-pot-vegan-mushroom-gravy-oilfree.html\n\nMushrooms can take a long time to cook down and brown in a pan for the right flavor. They cook faster under pressure. If you use less liquid in the dish, then they also brown and pick on a caramelized flavor under pressure. That is what I do for this gravy. \n\nNo need to brown or stand near the kitchen, and hence no need for the oil. Just chop and dump everything in the instant pot. Pressure cook. Come back and simmer for a few mins to thicken and done. As with most the recipes, stove top instructions are added too! Try this super flavorful 1 Pot Mushroom gravy!\n\nFor a Mushroom-free Gravy see https://www.veganricha.com/2017/11/vegan-gravy-1-pot-mushroom-free.html\n\nMusic: Show Love by Joakin Karud\n#easyveganrecipes #vegangravy #veganricha #instantpotgravy\n\nMY BOOKS:\nINDIAN KITCHEN:  https://veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nEVERYDAY KITCHEN: https://veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen\nFollow: \nMy blog: https://veganricha.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha","uploadDate":"2019-11-01T16:00:17+00:00","duration":"PT1M4S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tfDTFzAj1Dc/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfDTFzAj1Dc","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tfDTFzAj1Dc?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["8"],"prepTime":"PT10M","cookTime":"PT20M","totalTime":"PT30M","recipeIngredient":["10 oz mushrooms ((cremini, white, portabella or a mix))","1/2  small onion","3 cloves of garlic","1.5Â  tbsp vegan worchestershire sauce  (or use soy sauce or coconut aminos for soyfree)","1 tsp prepared mustard or 1/2 tsp ground mustard","1 tsp onion powder","1/2 tsp garlic powder","1/2 tsp ground sage","2 tsp fresh rosemary ((divided, 1 tsp if using dried))","1/2 tsp salt","2.5 cups low sodium vegetable broth/stock ((divided))","1/4 tsp white pepper (, less or more to preference)","1 tbsp cornstarch or potato starch","1/2 cup cashew cream or non dairy cream ((optional))"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Finely chop the mushroom, onion and garlic, by knife or in a food processor.&nbsp;Add to the instant pot.&nbsp; (Alternatively, You can cook the onion and garlic in 1/4 cup broth or wine on saute, for a few mins for additional flavor and then add mushrooms).","name":"Finely chop the mushroom, onion and garlic, by knife or in a food processor.&nbsp;Add to the instant pot.&nbsp; (Alternatively, You can cook the onion and garlic in 1/4 cup broth or wine on saute, for a few mins for additional flavor and then add mushrooms).","url":"https://www.veganricha.com/instant-pot-vegan-mushroom-gravy-oilfree/#wprm-recipe-29881-step-0-0"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Add the spices, herbs, 1 tsp rosemary, salt, Worcestershire (or use 1 tablespoon soy sauce and 2 tablespoons red wine) and 1 cup broth.&nbsp;.(Additional flavors such as poultry seasoning, herbs&nbsp;can be added at this point.
