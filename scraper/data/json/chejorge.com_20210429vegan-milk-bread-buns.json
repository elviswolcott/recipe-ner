Before starting, allow vegan butter to soften at room temperature. Take refrigerator-cold soy milk and microwave for about 30 seconds, or until its temperature reads 40 C (105 F).

In a large bowl, start by mixing together flour, sugar, and salt. Follow by slowly add boiling water to the mix while stirring vigorously. There should now be small shaggy clumps in the flour. Add the yeast-soy milk mixture and start mixing by hand. The dough should feel relatively sticky at this stage — add more soy milk if necessary. Note: You can cover the dough first and allow it to rest for ~15 minutes. This step is called \"autolyse\" and can make the dough a lot easier to work with. Mix the dough until it just comes together, then incorporate the butter as well (split the butter into cubes that are 1 tablespoon each). The whole kneading process should take around 7-10 minutes. Note: To test gluten development, you can tear off a small piece of dough and stretch it to see if light can pass through. This is known as the windowpane test. Once smooth, shape the dough into a ball and cover with a damp towel. Proof for 1-1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.","text":"First Proof.

Deflate the dough and divide into 6-8 portions. Shape each portion by first stretching each corner and folding towards the middle. Turn the dough over, cup your hand over it, and move in a circular motion to shape into a ball. Note: Do this on a surface with little to no flour. You want the dough to stick to the counter a little bit, so it will pull itself into a round shape as you move it. Place the shaped buns one-by-one on a parchment-lined baking tray, making sure there is ample space for each bun to grow. Cover and let rise for another 35-45 minutes, or until 1.5 times the original size.","text":"Second Proof. Deflate the dough and divide into 6-8 portions.
