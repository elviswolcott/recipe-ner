Start by heating vegetable oil (or other neutral oil) on medium-heat. Add garlic, ginger, and yellow onion & sauté until lightly caramelized, about 5 minutes. Add all frozen vegetable scraps (and/or fresh scraps) and dried shiitake mushrooms, followed by water. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to simmer for about 45-50 minutes. Note: keep an eye to make sure the broth never boils too rapidly! At the 20 minute mark, you can take out the shiitake mushrooms and reserve them for topping. When the broth is done, use a large sieve to drain it into another pot or large bowl. You can use a ladle to press on the used vegetables and squeeze out any excess liquid. Discard used vegetables afterwards.","text":"Prepare Vegetable Broth. Start by heating vegetable oil (or other neutral oil) on medium-heat.
