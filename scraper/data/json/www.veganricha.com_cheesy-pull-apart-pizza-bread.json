GF option\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡FULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2017/07/cheesy-pull-apart-pizza-bread.html\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡MY COOKBOOKS: https://veganricha.com/mybooks\n\nThese Pizza Rolls are super easy and a great snack for everyone at the party. I use my 20 minute pizza dough, divide and roll it into mini dinner roll size balls. Place them in a pie pan, then drizzle a mozzarella style cashew cream from my Pizza Dip Recipe (which you must try! it is GF). Some more pizza sauce, more of the mozzarella cream, basil and peppers and bake!\n\nThe cashew mozzarella cream thickens during baking. Use more cashews for thicker cream. The result is rolls coated in thick creamy cheese sauce, pizza sauce and other toppings(add some mushrooms, olives, peppers before the second cream drizzle). For gluten-free option, use my gluten-free dinner rolls or make the pizza dip. \nGF Pizza Dip: https://www.veganricha.com/2017/01/vegan-pizza-dip.html\n\n\n\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ BUY MY COOKBOOK: http://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen \nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ Join the Mailing List: https://veganricha.com/mailinglist\nðŸ’™ SUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\nðŸ’™ JOIN THE COMMUNITY:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nðŸ’™ COOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book:\nhttp://www.veganricha.com/vrekaz\nMy Amazon Store: https://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\n#vegan #veganism #easyveganrecipes #veganrecipes #veganricha #cooking \n\nMusic: Elevate by Lakey Inspired \nhttps://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired/","uploadDate":"2018-05-27T18:42:25+00:00","duration":"PT2M8S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zHJjR2A8t_Q/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHJjR2A8t_Q","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zHJjR2A8t_Q?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["4"],"prepTime":"PT15M","cookTime":"PT40M","totalTime":"PT55M","recipeIngredient":["1 cup warm water","2 teaspoons active yeast","1/2 tsp sugar or 1 tbsp flour","2  + cups flour (I use 1/2 cup wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups unbleached white)","3 tbsp semolina flour or use wheat flour","1/2 tsp salt","1/2 tsp oregano","1/4 tsp garlic powder","3 tsp extra virgin olive oil (divided)","1/3 cup cashews ((use a heaping up for creamier) soaked for 15 minutes in warm water then drained.)","1  small garlic clove","2 tsp extra virgin olive oil","1/2 tsp salt","1 tbsp + 2 tsp tapioca starch","1 tbsp nutritional yeast ( (optional))","1/2 tsp white miso (or use chickpea miso to make soyfree)","2/3 cup water","Pizza sauce or tomato sauce","dried oregano","1/4 cup chopped fresh basil (divided)","sliced jalapeno (optional)","pepper flakes for garnish"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToSection","name":"Make the dough.","itemListElement":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Proof the yeast by mixing yeast, warm water and sugar and letting it sit for 5 minutes.
