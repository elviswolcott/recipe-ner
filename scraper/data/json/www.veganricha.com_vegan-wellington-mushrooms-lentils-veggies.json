Puff pastry wrapped lentil walnut mushroom loaf. Serve with Gravy!\nFULL RECIPE HERE: https://www.veganricha.com/2017/12/vegan-wellington-mushrooms-lentils-veggies.html\n\nMake this fabulous puff pastry wrapped lentil mushroom walnut roast to celebrate. The lentil mushroom mixture is fabulous on it its own. You can make it into patties or a loaf and serve with gravy. The buttery crisp pastry makes it festive and decadent. \n\nOnion, garlic, walnuts gets toasted on the skillet, then mushrooms cooked down, then combined with lentils, veggies, herbs and flavoring. The mixture is packed into a puff pastry and baked to golden. Slice and serve with gravy , mashed potatoes, side salad. Sunlight fades too quickly these days so I made a quick wrap with slits. Use lattice or other pastry wrap designs to make it prettier. To make it gluten-free, make the mixture into patties or a glazed loaf or make hand pies with a gluten-free pie crust. \n\n#easyveganrecipes #veganthanksgiving #vegeanricha #veganholidays #veganentree\nMusic by Epidemic Sound\n\nMY BOOKS:\nINDIAN KITCHEN (Best-Seller):  https://veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nEVERYDAY KITCHEN: https://veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen\nBoth have about 150 Recipes each.
