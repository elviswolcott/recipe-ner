It is a popular Winter-Spring dessert in Northern India.  My Dad’s fave version has grated carrots that get slow roasted in a skillet over hours to become almost candied and the mix is more like a soft crumble. This Instant pot version cooks within minutes and works amazingly. For a Stove top version see here https://www.veganricha.com/2016/09/vegan-carrot-halwa-gajar-halwa-recipe.html\n\nThe Carrots get roasted with sugar for a bit then pressure cooked, then roasted again to dry them up. This Instant Pot Halwa will cook to a softer more pudding like state, and gets close to the stove roasted one after sitting for a bit to cool. I use purple and red carrots for the gorgeous color that would normally show up only on long roasting. To make this nut-free, use sunflower seed meal and omit the cashews. \nVegan Gluten-free Soy-free Recipe.\n\n\nBUY MY COOKBOOK: http://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen \n\nSUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n#vegan #veganism #easyveganrecipes #veganrecipes #veganricha #cooking \n✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧\nFIND ME:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nCOOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book:\nhttp://www.veganricha.com/vrekaz\n\nMY AMAZON STORE: https://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha \n✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧\n\nMusic: By Clueless kit - Not you\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6VJ9ZKn9k","uploadDate":"2018-03-22T21:55:40+00:00","duration":"PT1M29S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0Gb21G5BKWA/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gb21G5BKWA","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Gb21G5BKWA?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["4"],"prepTime":"PT10M","cookTime":"PT25M","totalTime":"PT35M","recipeIngredient":["1 tbsp vegan butter or oil","3 tbsp cashews","3 tbsp chopped dates (or raisins, or currants)","2.5 cups of shredded carrots (rainbow carrots or red or a combination of purple and red)","4 tbsp sugar","1/8 to 1/4 tsp salt (use 1/4 tsp if using oil instead of vegan butter)","1/4 cup almond meal","1/4 cup non dairy milk such as almond or soy (, use 1/2 cup if your carrots are not very moist)","1/4 tsp ground cardamom","pistachios or cashews for garnish"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Put the Instant pot on Saute (Stove top pressure cooker over medium heat).
