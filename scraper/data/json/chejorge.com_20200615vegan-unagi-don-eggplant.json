Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (204 degrees C). First, poke holes with a toothpick or a fork all around the eggplant — this will help the eggplant skin release after roasting. Roast the eggplants whole (without peeling) until their skins are blistered and the inside feels just soft, about 30-45 minutes depending on the size of the eggplant. Alternatively, you can microwave the eggplants to achieve a similar result. Place them on a microwave-safe plate, then cover with kitchen towel or a microwave cover and microwave until soft, about 5 minutes.","text":"Prepare the Eggplants.
