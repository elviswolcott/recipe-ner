I changed up the traditional red sauce ingredients in lasagna and used an all green sauce, a vegan pesto. I added some creamy cashew ricotta cheese and savory slices of tofu. A touch of jalapeño adds a hint of spiciness. This verde lasagna is a family-style entrée worth gathering at the table for!","datePublished":"2015-04-24T11:50:39+00:00","image":["https://www.veganricha.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/lasagnaverde-001-1.jpg","https://www.veganricha.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/lasagnaverde-001-1-500x500.jpg","https://www.veganricha.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/lasagnaverde-001-1-500x375.jpg","https://www.veganricha.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/lasagnaverde-001-1-480x270.jpg"],"recipeYield":["12"],"recipeIngredient":["1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil","12 to 14  lasagna noodles","2 cups fresh basil leaves","2 cups fresh spinach","½ cup fresh lemon juice","½ cup walnuts","¼ cup raw pumpkin seeds","¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil","1  jalapeño (seeded)","1 to 3 cloves garlic","14 ounces ﬁrm or silken tofu (thinly sliced)","½ teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil","Few pinches of sea salt and freshly ground black pepper","1 tablespoon nutritional yeast (optional)","2½ cups Cashew Ricotta","½ cup vegan mozzarella cheese shreds","½ cup chopped fresh basil (for garnish)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Preheat the oven to 350°F / 180ºc.

Add more of the pasta cooking water, a spoonful at a time, if desired to thin out the texture of the pesto a bit.
