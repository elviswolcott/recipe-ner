Start by bringing water to boil on the stove. Note: Stove-top cooking is the preferred method. Using a rice-cooker will not yield the same result! Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the rice, sliced ginger, and salt. Reduce to a simmer and let cook covered for about 30-45 minutes, stirring occasionally to make sure nothing sticks to the bottom. Cook until rice is soft & the porridge reaches a thick, creamy consistency. Note: you can add more water and continue cooking to adjust consistency.","text":"Make the Congee.
