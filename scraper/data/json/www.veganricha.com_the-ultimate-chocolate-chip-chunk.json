Take a handful of the dough (1/4-1/3 cup), roll into a ball and then press and shape into a disc of 4-5 inch width on parchment lined sheet.(I just press the ball directly on the parchment with my palm). Make as large or small to preference. Press the chocolate chips that remain the bowl after, into the shaped cookies. Sprinkle a little granulated sugar on top and press lightly on the cookie. Bake for 11-12 minutes. Let cool completely.(5 minutes). The cookies will soft out of the oven, but will firm up. Bake for less time for smaller cookies (till just about starting to get golden on the edges). Store in an airtight container once completely cool.","name":"Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F / 190ºc.
