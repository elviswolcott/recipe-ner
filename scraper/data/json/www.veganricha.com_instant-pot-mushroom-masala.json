Easy Mushrooms and Peas in Creamy Sauce! GF Stovetop option\nðŸ’™ FULL RECIPE HERE: https://www.veganricha.com/2018/05/instant-pot-mushroom-masala.html\nðŸ’™ MY COOKBOOKS!: https://veganricha.com/mybooks\n\nThe Stove top version of Mushroom mutter Masala has been loved a lot. It is super easy 1 pot 30 mins as well. But its summer, and no one wants all the heat from the stove in the house. So lets make this Instant Pot (pressure cooker) version!\n\nThe recipe is super quick and versatile. Add some chickpeas or other beans with the mushrooms to make it a hearty meal. Use other spice blends for flavor variations. I have been using baharat blend (recipe in everyday kitchen) in this lately. Berbere would too. \n\nThe sauce is a blender sauce( no chopping of garlic ginger required). Finely Chop the onion, garlic and use if you prefer(the blended mixture can sometimes turn green on cooking because of old garlic. Its edible, just might add some of the color to the sauce).\n\nThen use the same blender to blend the tomato into a puree. Add to the pot with spices and mushrooms and pressure cook. Then use the same blender to make cashew cream, if you dont already have some. Use coconut milk, yogurt or pumpkin seed ream to make nut-free. Add to the pot after the pressure cooking for best creamy results.\nMore Instant Pot Recipes: http://veganricha.com/category/instant-pot\nStovetop Version: https://www.veganricha.com/2016/08/mushroom-matar-masala.html\n\n\nðŸ§¡ Join the Mailing List: https://veganricha.com/mailinglist\nðŸ§¡ BUY MY COOKBOOK: http://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen \n\nðŸ’™ SUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1 \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\nðŸ’™ JOIN THE COMMUNITY:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nðŸ’™ COOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book:\nhttp://www.veganricha.com/vrekaz\nMy Amazon Store: https://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\n#vegan #veganism #easyveganrecipes #veganrecipes #veganricha #cooking \n\nMusic: butterfly by Joakim Karud\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqAZ89O5pWU","uploadDate":"2018-06-09T14:30:01+00:00","duration":"PT1M55S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CVf7yHaHZZU/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVf7yHaHZZU","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CVf7yHaHZZU?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["3"],"prepTime":"PT10M","cookTime":"PT20M","totalTime":"PT30M","recipeIngredient":["1/2  large onion ( chopped)","5 cloves garlic","1 inch ginger","1/2 to 1  green chile (, remove seeds to reduce heat if needed)","1 tsp oil","2  large tomatoes","1/2 to 1 tsp garam masala (( or use baharat or berbere))","1/2 tsp paprika","1/4 tsp turmeric","1 tsp dried fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi) (or use 1/4 tsp fenugreek seed powder or 1/4 tsp ground mustard)","8 oz sliced white mushrooms","1/2 tsp or more salt","1/2 cup or more peas","1 cup chopped spinach","1/4 tsp or more sugar or maple syrup or other sweetener","1/4 cup raw cashews soaked for 15 mins if needed (, use 1/3 cup for creamier sauce, blended with 1/2 cup water until smooth)","1/4 tsp cayenne to preference","cilantro for garnish"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Blend onion, garlic, ginger, chile with a few tablespoons of water into a puree in a blender.","name":"Blend onion, garlic, ginger, chile with a few tablespoons of water into a puree in a blender.","url":"https://www.veganricha.com/instant-pot-mushroom-masala/#wprm-recipe-28736-step-0-0"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Put Instant Pot on Saute.
