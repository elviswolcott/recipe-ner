Let this ferment anywhere from 2-4 days depending on your taste; the longer it sits, the stronger the flavor. There will be bubbles and a layer of foam that forms on top of the tepache; this is completely normal and is encouraged as this is a sign of proper fermentation. Stir and taste every 12-24 hours. I usually let mine sit out for 4 days.","name":"Give this a good stir, cover loosely with a lid or cheesecloth, and let it sit at room temperature away from direct sunlight.
