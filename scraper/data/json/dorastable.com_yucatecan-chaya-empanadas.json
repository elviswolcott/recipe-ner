Line your tortilla press with two sheets of plastic (cut grocery bags work the best). Place one ball of dough in the center of the press, and press down to about 1/4 inch (6mm) thick. Open the press, and remove the sheet of plastic on top of the dough and place 1 ½  tablespoons of the cheese in the center. Fold the dough over the filling, making the edges meet, press edges to seal, forming an empanada. Peel the remaining plastic off and place the empanada on a sheet tray lined with parchment paper. Repeat this process with the rest of the empanadas.","name":"To make the empanadas: Roll the dough into balls the size of a golf ball (50g)(1.7 oz.).
