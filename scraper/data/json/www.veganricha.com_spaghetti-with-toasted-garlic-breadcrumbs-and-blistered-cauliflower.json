Vegan Nutfree Soyfree Recipe\n\nI had been eyeing Mario bataliâ€™s toasted breadcrumb spaghetti when I first happened upon it. The toasty garlic and breadcrumb idea was intriguing. I changed up the process to toast the breadcrumbs and garlic together. The flavor of the mix is enhanced with some lemon zest and pepper instead of cheese. The dish gets rounded up with some blistered cauliflower that enhances the toastyness and balances the garlic and parsley.\n\nI use fresh bread for breadcrumbs in this dish as the breadcrumbs are tastier, less dry and absorb a lot more flavor. Be generous with the garlic, breadcrumbs, toasting time and parsley or other favorite fresh herb!\n\n******MORE PASTA FROM THE BLOG******\n\nVEGAN LEMON ASPARAGUS PASTA: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-lemon-asparagus-pasta/\n\nCREAMY SUN DRIED TOMATO PASTA WITH GARLIC SOY CURLS: https://www.veganricha.com/creamy-sun-dried-tomato-pasta-garlic-soy-curls/\n\nVEGAN GARLIC PASTA WITH ROASTED CAJUN CAULIFLOWER: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-garlic-pasta-roasted-cajun-cauliflower/\n\nCOOKBOOKS BY RICHA HINGLE (VEGAN RICHA): https://www.veganricha.com/mybooks/\n\nConnect with me on Social Media:\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\n\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/veganricha\n\nPINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/veganricha\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound \n\n#veganspaghetti #spaghettirecipe #veganricha #easyveganrecipes","uploadDate":"2021-05-28T22:53:06+00:00","duration":"PT1M11S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4w8YVC4B9Pk/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w8YVC4B9Pk","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4w8YVC4B9Pk?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["4"],"prepTime":"PT10M","cookTime":"PT30M","totalTime":"PT40M","recipeIngredient":["10 oz spaghetti ( or other similar pasta)","1 tsp oil","2 cups cauliflower florets (, small florets)","1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper","2 tbsp chopped parsley or other fresh herbs such as basil or oregano or a mix","pinch of salt","1 tbsp olive oil","4 cloves of garlic (, minced or finely chopped)","3/4 cups breadcrumbs made from 2 slices of bread","1 tbsp almond flour (, optional)","1 tsp lemon zest","1/4 tsp salt","1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper","1/2 tsp dried oregano","1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley (or more)","pepper flakes, lemon juice, olive oil for garnish"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Cook the spaghetti according to instruction on the package, rinse in cold water and set aside.
