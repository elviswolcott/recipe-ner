Simple everyday waffles that you can dress as you like. These easy waffles are a breeze to put together. They can also be adjusted to preferred crispyness and texture. I make a mix of flours and use that in the waffle recipe. You can play around with other flours of choice too.\n\nA direct completely gluten-free substitution doesn’t work in the recipe, I’ll have a gluten-free version posted separately with a gf blend and the process that makes crispy non dry non crumbly waffles. In this recipe, you can replace a quarter of the flour with an alternate flour(with or without gluten flour).\n\n\n\nMusic: Skandr X Chaël - Lollipop \n\n\nFollow \n My blog: https://veganricha.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\n#veganricharecipes #easyveganrecipes #veganwaffles #crispywaffles #veganbreakfast","uploadDate":"2019-10-03T01:22:42+00:00","duration":"PT1M15S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pbs70jkXARs/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbs70jkXARs","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pbs70jkXARs?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["2"],"recipeIngredient":["1 1/4 cup of my waffle mix (below) or   (all purpose flour + 2 tsp starch)","2 tsp baking powder","1/4 tsp salt","3 tbsp sugar (, fine cane sugar or coconut sugar or light brown)","1 1/4 cup non-dairy milk such as almond or soy or light coconut milk","1 tbsp oil (, plus more for cooking if needed)","1 tsp vanilla extract","a few drops almond extract ( or 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon)","3/4 cup unbleached all purpose flour","1/3 cup wheat pastry flour  (or use more all purpose)","1 tbsp starch such as tapioca or cornstarch","2 tbsp almond flour (or use 1 tbsp rice flour for nut-free)","1 tsp flax seed meal (,optional)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"In a large bowl, whisk the flours under waffle mix.
