A super tall rise, because who likes muffins that dont rise enough or fall after baking! Just the right amount of berries, and a streusel that brings it all together. The streusel keeps the muffins moist by reducing the moisture loss from the top. The flour tossed fresh berries stay right in place and don’t sink to the bottom. Some lime zest brightens up the flavor!\n#veganrecipes #easyveganrecipes #veganricha #blueberrymuffins #veganbluebererymuffins\nMusic: Ikson Calling\n\nFollow: \nMy blog: https://veganricha.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/","uploadDate":"2019-10-10T22:45:00+00:00","duration":"PT1M46S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2lFwZnCg8gs/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lFwZnCg8gs","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2lFwZnCg8gs?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["12"],"prepTime":"PT10M","cookTime":"PT25M","totalTime":"PT35M","recipeIngredient":["1 cup non dairy milk (, such as almond or soy or lite coconut milk)","3 tbsp non dairy yogurt,  or use 2 tbsp applesauce or non dairy milk","1 tsp apple cider vinegar or other vinegar","1/3 cup unrefined sugar (, use 1 tbsp more for sweeter)","1/4 cup oil (neutral such as organic safflower or canola   (, see note for oilfree)","1 tsp vanilla extract","a few drops of almond extract (, optional but wonderful)","2 cups of flour ((I use a mix of unbleached all purpose (1.25 cup) and wheat (3/4 cup)))","2 tsp baking powder","1/4 tsp baking soda","1/2 tsp salt","Zest of a lime","2 cups fresh blueberries","1/4 cup flour","1/4 cup coconut sugar or brown sugar","2 tbsp vegan butter (softened, or oil)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Line a muffin pan.
