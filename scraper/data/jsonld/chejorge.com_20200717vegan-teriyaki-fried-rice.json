In a work or pan, heat up vegetable oil on medium-high heat. Add the garlic, ginger, and dried chilis and cook together until aromatic, around 1 minute. Follow with yellow onions and pearl onions and cook until softened and lightly caramelized. Once the onions are nicely caramelized and charred, add the leftover cooked rice. Leftover rice is likely to be very clumpy so just use your spatula to break up the clumps. Once you've broken up the clumps and tossed the rice with the onions, add in the teriyaki sauce as well as frozen edamame (you don't need to thaw them before-hand). Toss everything together and cook for a few additional minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning with additional teriyaki sauce. Serve warm.","text":"Make the Teriyaki Fried Rice.
