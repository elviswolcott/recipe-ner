In a medium-sized pot, heat up vegetable oil on medium-low heat. Add ginger and garlic, and fry for another 30-60 seconds, or until smelling nice. Add doubanjiang (spicy bean paste) and slowly fry until the oil stains orange. Place the king oyster mushrooms in the pot and turn the heat up to medium. Cook the mushrooms for 2-3 minutes, turning as needed, until each side is lightly-browned. Note: You can use a heavy object to press down on the mushrooms at this point to achieve a denser, more \"meaty\" texture. Deglaze the pot with the prepared sauce, followed by the bay leaf and five-spice. Cook covered for 15 minutes.","text":"Cook the King Oyster Mushrooms.
