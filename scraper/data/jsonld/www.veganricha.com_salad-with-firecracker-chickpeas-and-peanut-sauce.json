Served with a crunchy lettuce, carrot, red bell pepper salad, a light drizzle of peanut sauce and garnished with cilantro/scallions.\n\nYou can also use the firecracker sauce as the dressing. For variation, use kale, greens, other veggies. Use lentils to make firecracker lentils. Serve over rice instead of salad. Vegan Gluten-free Soyfree (use coconut aminos in the PB sauce). Use sunbutter to make it Nut-free. \n \n\n** BUY MY COOKBOOK: http://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen \n\n\nSUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n#vegan #veganism #easyveganrecipes #veganrecipes #veganricha #cooking \n✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧\nFOLLOW US:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nCOOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book:\nhttp://www.veganricha.com/vrekaz\n\n✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧\nMusic by D J Grumble:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/gbeats","uploadDate":"2018-03-17T19:43:53+00:00","duration":"PT1M37S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2qtFtsRhw9U/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://youtu.be/2qtFtsRhw9U","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2qtFtsRhw9U?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["4"],"prepTime":"PT25M","cookTime":"PT15M","totalTime":"PT40M","recipeIngredient":["Chopped lettuce  (or other crunchy greens)","Grated or thinly sliced carrots","thinly sliced red bell pepper","thinly slices zucchini or cucumber","chopped cilantro  (or scallions for garnish)","peanuts for garnish (optional)","1 recipe Peanut sauce","Or this Peanut Sauce","15 oz can chickpeas (drained (save the aquafaba for meringue) or 1.5 cups cooked)","1/2 tsp oil","1/4 tsp salt or to taste (depends on if chickpeas were salted)","1/4 tsp cayenne","1/4 tsp garlic powder","1 tsp cornstarch  (or other starch)","1 tbsp hot sauce  (such as frank's hot sauce)","1.5 tsp sriracha  (or other asian chile garlic sauce)","1.5 to 2 tbsp rice vinegar","2 to 3 tbsp raw sugar  (or brown sugar or other)","2 tbsp water"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Chop up the veggies, toss and place in serving bowl.","name":"Chop up the veggies, toss and place in serving bowl.","url":"https://www.veganricha.com/salad-with-firecracker-chickpeas-and-peanut-sauce/#wprm-recipe-27303-step-0-0"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"In a skillet, add the chickpeas, oil, salt, cayenne, garlic and mix well.
