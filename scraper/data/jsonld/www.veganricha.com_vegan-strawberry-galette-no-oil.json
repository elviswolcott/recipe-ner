Enough said!\n\nThis Slice of summer comes together quickly with a few ingredients. Mix up the flour with salt, sugar, baking soda, then add coconut cream to make crumbs. Then bring it together using some coconut milk and roll it out. Ripe plump strawberries are thinly sliced and added to the crust. add some lime zest, fold and bake. The strawberries roast and get jammy because of their liquid during baking and the crust holds all that juicyness in.\n\nThe crust if rustic and crisp. For a more pie like crust, add 2-3 tbsp oil or softened vegan butter with the coconut cream. This tart is easy and so delicious! For gluten-free option see, recipe notes.
