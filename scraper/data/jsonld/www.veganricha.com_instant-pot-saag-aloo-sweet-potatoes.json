Saag means greens or a dish made of greens, and Aloo is potatoes. I use Chard for the greens in this video. Spinach, mustard or a mix with baby kale and other greens will work too. For the Aloo, I use sweet potatoes. Regular potatoes will work as as well.  \n\nA simple dish with onion, ginger, garlic, some spices, then some non dairy yogurt or vegan cream of choice, pressure cook and done. Saucepan option on the post. Takes just 10 Minutes to put together. Serve this easy Sweet Potato Curry with Dals or bean curries.\n\nThe recipe can easily be made Nut-free and in a Saucepan(instructions in the Recipe notes on the post). Easily made oilfree. Add some cooked chickpeas or lentils to make it into a meal. \nVegan Gluten-free Recipe.\n\n\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ BUY MY COOKBOOK: http://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen \nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ Join the Mailing List: https://veganricha.com/mailinglist\n\nðŸ’™ SUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\nâœ¦ JOIN THE COMMUNITY:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nâœ¦ COOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book:\nhttp://www.veganricha.com/vrekaz\nMy Amazon Store: https://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\n#vegan #veganism #easyveganrecipes #veganrecipes #veganricha #cooking \nMusic: Undeniable","uploadDate":"2018-04-27T18:30:51+00:00","duration":"PT1M46S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IrdPRkpHsfo/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrdPRkpHsfo","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IrdPRkpHsfo?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["3"],"prepTime":"PT10M","cookTime":"PT20M","totalTime":"PT30M","recipeIngredient":["1 tsp oil (or use 2 tbsp water or broth to saute)","4 cloves of garlic (finely chopped)","2 tsp minced ginger","1  small onion (chopped)","1 tsp ground cumin (, or 1/2 tsp cumin and 1/2 tsp coriander)","1/2 tsp ground cinnamon","1/4 tsp ground cardamom","1/3 tsp cayenne","1  or 2 whole cloves ((or use 1/8 tsp ground cloves))","1/2 tsp turmeric","3/4 tsp salt","2 cups cubed sweet potato (, or regular potatoes)","2 cups packed chopped chard (, spinach or a mix of greens)","1/2 cup water (use 3/4 cup for saucier)","1/2 cup non dairy yogurt or full fat coconut milk","lemon and cilantro for garnish"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Heat oil in Instant pot on saute.
