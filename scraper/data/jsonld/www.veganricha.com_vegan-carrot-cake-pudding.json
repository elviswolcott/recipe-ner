Kuzu contains no fat, is low in calories, and has virtually no taste. Not only a thickening agent - it is used to treat stomach and digestion issues, to stimulate appetite, as an aid to relieve diarrhea and even as a cold remedy. And you thought this was just going to be just a bowl of pudding!\n\nGluten-free, Oil-free, Easy.\nServes 6, Cook Time 15 mins. Set time: 4 to 6 hours\n*Recipe reprinted with permission from Ann Oliverio and Front Table Books.","datePublished":"2015-04-17T11:05:20+00:00","image":["https://www.veganricha.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/CCPudding2-LR1-1.jpg","https://www.veganricha.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/CCPudding2-LR1-1-500x500.jpg","https://www.veganricha.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/CCPudding2-LR1-1-500x375.jpg","https://www.veganricha.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/CCPudding2-LR1-1-480x270.jpg"],"recipeYield":["6"],"prepTime":"PT15M","cookTime":"PT15M","recipeIngredient":["2 cups fresh or bottled carrot juice (make sure it’s 100% carrot juice)","2 cups coconut milk","2 Tbsp. pure maple syrup","1 tsp. ground cinnamon","1/2 tsp. ground ginger","1/8 tsp. ground cloves","1/8 tsp. cardamom","5 Tbsp. kuzu root powder","Whipped coconut cream (for topping, optional)","Golden raisins (for garnish, optional)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Combine all ingredients in a bowl or a large measuring cup.
