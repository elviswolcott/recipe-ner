In a small-medium sized non-stick pan, heat a touch of vegetable oil on high heat. Pour the batter into the pan — adjust the amount according to the size of your pan.

Unstick the sides of the crepe. When the crepe appears to no longer stick to the pan, start rolling it. I like to use a flipper and a pair of chopsticks to help me flip. This is the most difficult step — be very careful! Once you have the crepe rolled up, keep the pan on high heat and fry it until both sides are crispy and golden brown. Once they are, remove the Dan Bing from the pan and let it cool a bit before slicing.","text":"Roll up the Dan Bing.
