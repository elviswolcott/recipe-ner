Gluten-free, Soyfree options on the post. \n\nYou can build up this burrito however you like. Add or remove a component to preference. I build it up with a simple tofu scramble, some breakfast potatoes or roasted veggies, chickpea pancake that adds more protein, some pepitas, fresh crunchy veggies and a dressing. Its a scramble, veggie, omelet, crunch and dressing burrito. You can also serve these ingredients in a breakfast taco format! Make ahead and keep refrigerated. to make these freezer friendly use veggies such as zucchini, peppers, cauliflower instead of potatoes or add some cooked spiced beans or quinoa. \n\nHigh protein breakfast burrito or tacos. Nutfree Recipe. For Soyfree, use my chickpeea flour tofu. For Gluten-free use my glutenfree tortillas.\n\n________________________________________________________________\nHi, I'm Richa!
