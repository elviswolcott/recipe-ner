This past few months have been about Cajun, my own homemade seasoning. Exhibit 1- Cajun Cauliflower over Garlic pasta, so Good!, exhibit 2- Cajun Spiced Sloppy lentils, oh my gosh! (both recipes are on the blog veganricha.com)\n\nThis week serve up this easy Cajun Tofu Bowl however you want it, but make some! The Tofu is rubbed up with Cajun spice blend and lime pasta or make a marinade, then baked. Meanwhile, make the other bowl components like a refreshing cilantro lime rice. Add roasted veggies, chopped up tomato/crunchy veggies or pico de gallo, some greens or lettuce. Slice the baked tofu and serve. You can use the cajun blend paste over chickpea tofu, chickpeas/beans or hearty vegetables as cauliflower, eggplant, sweet potato, zucchini and roast them until tender and use those in the bowl instead of tofu for soy-free\nVegan Glutenfree Nutfree Recipe. \n\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ BUY MY COOKBOOK: http://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen \nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ Join the Mailing List: https://veganricha.com/mailinglist\n\nðŸ’™ SUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\nðŸ§¡ JOIN THE COMMUNITY:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nðŸ’™ COOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book:\nhttp://www.veganricha.com/vrekaz\nMy Amazon Store: https://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\n#vegan #veganism #easyveganrecipes #veganrecipes #veganricha #cooking \n\nMusic: this Feeling By Lakey Inspired\nhttps://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired/","uploadDate":"2018-05-19T21:19:55+00:00","duration":"PT1M23S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8pRXTDAFvoc/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pRXTDAFvoc","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8pRXTDAFvoc?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["4"],"prepTime":"PT10M","cookTime":"PT30M","totalTime":"PT40M","recipeIngredient":["12 to 14 oz firm tofu","1.5 to 2 tbsp cajun spice blend (, see note)","1 tbsp lime juice","2 tspÂ  olive oil","1/4 to 1/2 tsp salt","1 cup long grain rice or basmati rice","1/2 tsp oil","2 cups water","1/2 tsp salt","1 tbsp or more lime juice","1/4 cup packed finely chopped cilantro","crunchy greens, chopped tomato or cucumber,  lime juice"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Press the tofu (wrap in paper towel, then kitchen towel and place a couple of heavy books on it for 15 minutes or use a tofu press).
