Turns out, butternut squash is an excellent substitute for egg yolks, making these buns vegan-friendly and taste just as good!

Add the mixture to a pot, and bring to a boil while stirring constantly until thickened. Place in the freezer for around 30 minutes to firm up. To know if the filling is firm enough, if you run your fork through it, it should crumble up and shouldn’t stick to your hands when you try to shape it. Run a fork through the filling to break it all up & roll into evenly sized balls that are 18-20 grams each (10 balls).","text":"Make the Custard Filling. Once the butternut squash has cooled completely, remove the flesh & mash with a fork.

Take one dough ball and roll it out into a rectangular sheet, then fold it over, turn it 90 degrees, and repeat. Repeat this rolling & folding for 5 times. I first saw this done by a Chinese pastry chef — the technique yields a super smooth bun. At the end, roll the dough into a round shape (doesn’t have to be completely round) and place a ball of filling in the middle. Note: I usually keep all the filling in the fridge and take them out one at a time, so they don’t start melting too fast. Gather the dough to the top. Continue to twist until the top is sealed and a bit of extra dough remains. Remove the extra dough, turn the bun on its smooth side, and place on a piece of parchment paper.","text":"Make the Buns (video tutorial available on my instagram). Work on one bun at a time.
