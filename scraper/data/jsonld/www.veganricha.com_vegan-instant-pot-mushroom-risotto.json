No standing & stirring needed. \nðŸ’™ FULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2018/06/vegan-instant-pot-mushroom-risotto.html\nðŸ’™ MY COOKBOOKS: https://veganricha.com/mybooks\n\n  Risotto reminds me of khichdi/kitchari. Creamy, comfort food in a bowl that is simple, delicious and a canvas to build more flavor over. This Mushroom risotto is super quick, simple. Delicious, made in an Instant Pot Pressure Cooker. It takes just a few mins to get the same creamy bowl that works for all seasons. \n\n  Saute the onion, brown the mushrooms, add the rice and roast for a minute, add the broth, mix, pressure cook and done. No standing near the stove top needed. Just 20 Minutes of Active time. Add herbs and flavors of choice. Stove top option in the Recipe notes. Serve with roasted seasonal veggies or a side salad. \nVegan Gluten-free Nut-free Recipe. \n\n\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ BUY MY COOKBOOK: http://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen \nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ Join the Mailing List: https://veganricha.com/mailinglist\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ SUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\nâœ¦ JOIN THE COMMUNITY:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nâœ¦ COOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book:\nhttp://www.veganricha.com/vrekaz\nMy Amazon Store: https://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\n#vegan #veganism #easyveganrecipes #veganrecipes #veganricha #cooking \nMusic:\n\nMusic: Bloom by Ikson","uploadDate":"2018-06-28T14:30:01+00:00","duration":"PT2M5S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yXxkqC3sWoU/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXxkqC3sWoU","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yXxkqC3sWoU?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["3"],"prepTime":"PT10M","cookTime":"PT20M","totalTime":"PT30M","recipeIngredient":["3 tsp oil (, divided)","1/2  white onion (chopped)","4 cloves of garlic (chopped)","8 oz sliced mushrooms (, white, cremini, portabella or mixed, 8 to 10 oz)","1/2 tsp salt (, divided (use less if using salted broth))","1/2 tsp dried thyme","1/2 tsp tarragon or rosemary","1/2 tsp poultry seasoning (or add some thyme, sage, rosemary and onion powder)","a generous dash of black pepper","1 cup arborio rice","2 1/4 cup water or veggie broth (or mushroom broth (add some dried mushroom mix powder for additional flavor))","1-2 cups baby spinach","vegan butter (, vegan parm, a handful of chopped parsley for garnish)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Put the Instant Pot on saute.
