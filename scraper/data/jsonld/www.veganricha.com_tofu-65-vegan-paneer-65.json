Serve it with rice or as is. Vegan Nut-free Recipe\nFULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2019/09/tofu-65-vegan-paneer-65.html\nINDIAN KITCHEN:  https://veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nEVERYDAY KITCHEN: https://veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen\n\nDon’t ask me why this dish is called tofu 65. There are several theories on why the sauce combination, initially used with chikin was called chicken 65. From there vegetarian versions picked up the flavors for paneer 65 and cauliflower 65 (Gobi 65 is in Indian Kitchen book).\n\nThe flavors have influence from Chinese sweet and sour profile and southern Indian flavors for this delectable thick sauce that is spicy, savory, sweet, with hints of flavors from curry leaves and chilies. It all works! You have to try it #trustindianflavors ! You can find curry leaves in Indian stores or online on amazon, or just omit. \n\nTofu is battered in a spiced curry leaf and soy sauce batter, then baked. The sauce has large slices of onion and bell pepper with ginger, garlic, soy sauce and sriracha. A bit of sweet to balance it out.\n\nDon’t like Tofu? Use Cauliflower or soy curls! Lots of substitute options in the recipe notes.\nGluten-free Options in notes as well.\n\n#veganricha #easyveganrecicpes #tofu65 #paneer65 #indianrecipes \nMusic: Calling by Ikson\n\nFollow: \nMy blog: https://veganricha.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha","uploadDate":"2019-10-22T19:23:39+00:00","duration":"PT2M22S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JLZ59UgRnpc/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLZ59UgRnpc","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JLZ59UgRnpc?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["4"],"prepTime":"PT10M","cookTime":"PT30M","totalTime":"PT40M","recipeIngredient":["14 oz firm or extra-firm tofu","3 tbsp all purpose flour (, use rice flour for gluten-free)","3 tbsp corn starch","6  fresh or frozen curry Leaves (, chopped (see notes))","1/2 tsp paprika","1/4 tsp cayenne","1/2 tsp garlic powder","1 tsp minced ginger","1 tsp lemon juice","2 tsp soy sauce (, tamari for gluten-free)","1/3 tsp salt","3-4 tbsp water","2 tsp Oil","1-2  hot green chilies (, such as serrano , sliced thin)","10  curry leaves","4 cloves garlic  (, finely chopped)","1/2  green bell pepper (sliced)","1/2  small red onion (sliced)","1 tbsp sriracha or sambal oelek or a mix of both ((use less for less heat))","1 tbsp soy sauce (, tamari for gluten-free)","1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper","1/4 tsp salt","1 tsp sugar","2 tsp cornstarch","1/2 cup water"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"In a large bowl, add flour, cornstarch, curry leaves, paprika, cayenne, garlic, salt and ginger.
