If you’re looking for that perfect chocolate cake—rich, complex, but light— look no further. How about deep, fudgy brownies (pictured opposite)? It’s right here. Or almost guilt-free and oil-free chocolate muffins? Got those covered, too. Best of all, if you have kids like mine who tell you at ten o’clock at night that they need a treat to take to school the next day, you’ll be the supermom who can whip out amazing desserts “from scratch” in moments.
