Heat some vegetable oil in a pan on medium heat and place the dumplings in — be sure not to overcrowd the pan!! For this recipe, I fried the dumplings in two batches. Fry the dumplings flat-side down for 4 minutes first, then pour a cornstarch slurry (1 tablespoon of cornstarch to 3 tablespoons of water) over the dumplings. Remember to save half of the cornstarch slurry if you're frying the dumplings in two batches. Quickly cover the pan with a lid (but leave a small hole if the lid doesn't already have one) and cook for 8-9 minutes. Near the end of the cooking, you can remove the lid and turn up the heat to achieve extra browning.","text":"To Pan-Fry the Dumplings.
