In a pot, add water, mushroom-soaking liquid, ginger, carrots, shiitake mushrooms, and black fungus.

Give the cornstarch slurry a final stir (to make sure the slurry is homogenous), and slowly swirl it into the soup to thicken. Add more cornstarch (dissolved in equal parts water) to thicken even more, or add more water if the soup becomes too thick.
