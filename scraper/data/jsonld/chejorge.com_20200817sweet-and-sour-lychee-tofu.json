For this recipe, we’re working with twice frozen and thawed tofu. As the name suggests, the tofu has been frozen, thawed, frozen again, and completely thawed again (all within its original container). After the second thaw, use a heavy object or a tofu press to weigh the tofu down for at least 15 minutes, pressing out as much liquid as possible. At the end of the pressing, the height of the tofu should have halved. Using your fingers, pull away chunks of tofu (I think about sphere/square-ish chunks) — the goal is to get them to look naturally torn. Place the tofu chunks in a bowl with cornstarch and carefully toss to evenly coat.","text":"Prepare the Tofu. For this recipe, we’re working with twice frozen and thawed tofu.
