Chard /Methi Matar Malai Vegan. Dairy-free creamy greens & peas w/ indian spices, somewhat like spinach dip\nFULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2014/01/rainbow-chard-and-peas-in-creamy-gravy.html\n\nOne of my favorite ways to eat Fenugreek used to be Methi Malai Matar (Fresh Fenugreek leaves and Peas in creamy buttery sauce). The sauce generally has a good amount of cream, butter and sometimes grated Paneer cheese. This version of course, does not use any of that, it has non dairy subs and also uses Rainbow chard which is much more easily available in the Northwest. Some dried Fenugreek leaves help add the Methi flavor and result is amazingly delicious. Hence, Chard Malai Mutter. Think a spinach artichoke dip but more of a side. You can serve it like a dip with chips too. Spiced Indian style greens, peas and cream dip. Or Serve with Naan. \n\n#veganricha #easyveganrecipes #meethimatarmalai #creamedchardandpeas #veganindian\nMusic Epidemic Sound.","uploadDate":"2019-12-03T20:13:55+00:00","duration":"PT53S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/86aNRilWBws/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86aNRilWBws","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/86aNRilWBws?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["2"],"prepTime":"PT20M","cookTime":"PT25M","totalTime":"PT45M","recipeIngredient":["2 teaspoons oil","1/2  medium onion chopped","1/2  Serrano chili pepper chopped or to taste","3-4 cloves of garlic finely chopped","1/2 inch ginger finely chopped","3-4  large chard leaves (chopped (chopped 2.5-3 cups packed) or use other Greens)","1/2 cup peas","1/4 tsp cumin powder or cumin seeds","1/4 tsp cinnamon powder","1/4 tsp cardamom powder","2 tsp Kasoori Methi (dried Fenugreek leaves or 1/4 tsp fenugreek seed powder)","1/4  loaded cup soaked cashews (soak in hot water for 15 minutes)","3/4 cup almond milk  (or non dairy milk)","1/2 tsp salt","1/2 tsp raw sugar  (or other sweetener)","1/4 tsp Kashmiri garam masala (optional (or use regular garam masala + a pinch of ground cloves))"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"In a pan, add oil and heat on low-medium heat.
