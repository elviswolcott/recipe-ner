Use sriracha for variation.\n\nThere can’t be too many mac and cheese recipes right. This version has some gochujang (Korean condiment that is spicy, fermented and pungent). It also makes a great addition to a creamy sharp flavored mac and cheese. Add as much gochujang as you like, or use Asian Chile Sauce or Sriracha instead. Serve this mac with roasted veggies that are glazed in gochujang + soy sauce+ sugar or over some broccoli or with a lentil loaf with a sriracha maple glaze. I like this with a sprinkle of vegan parm and generous black pepper. A toasty breadcrumb topping with a mix of toasted bread crumbs, a clove of garlic minced and herbs of choice, works amazing as well. \n\n\n******MORE  RECIPES FROM THE BLOG******\n\nMASALA MAC AND CHEESE WITH INDIAN SPICES: https://www.veganricha.com/masala-mac-and-cheese-vegan-recipe/\n\nCAULIFLOWER ALFREDO SPINACH ARTICHOKE LASAGNA: https://www.veganricha.com/cauliflower-alfredo-spinach-artichoke/\n\nNACHO MAC AND CHEESE CASSEROLE WITH TACO TEMPEH ‘MEAT’: https://www.veganricha.com/nacho-mac-and-cheese-casserole-vegan/\n\nVEGAN BLACK PEPPER MAC AND CHEESE WITH POTATO CARROT CHEESE SAUCE: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-black-pepper-mac-cheese-with-potato-carrot-cheese/\n\nCOOKBOOKS BY RICHA HINGLE (VEGAN RICHA): https://www.veganricha.com/mybooks/\n\nConnect with me on Social Media:\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\n\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/veganricha\n\nPINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/veganricha\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound \n\n#macandcheese #veganpasta #veganmacandcheese #veganricha #easyveganrecipes","uploadDate":"2021-02-15T16:43:00+00:00","duration":"PT2M19S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x7BPKd23Cxs/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7BPKd23Cxs","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/x7BPKd23Cxs?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["2"],"prepTime":"PT10M","cookTime":"PT25M","totalTime":"PT35M","recipeIngredient":["8 oz macaroni pasta","1 cup chopped broccoli","1 tsp olive oil","1/2  medium onion chopped","4 cloves of garlic minced","1 tbsp gochujang or use sambal oelek (asian chile paste, or sriracha)","4 cloves of roasted garlic","1/4 cup cashews","1 tbsp cornstarch  (or arrowroot starch)","1 3/4 cup water","1/2 tsp paprika","3/4 tsp or more salt","1/4 tsp black pepper","1/4 tsp prepared mustard or ground","2 tsp soy sauce","1 tbsp ketchup or tomato paste","1 to 2 tsp lemon juice or apple cider vinegar","2 tsp extra virgin olive oil","3 tbsp nutritional yeast","1/2 tsp thyme","black pepper to taste"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Make your pasta according to instruction on the package by boiling in a large saucepan.
