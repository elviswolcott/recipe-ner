Spiced, lightly sweet and great with soups, chilis or on its own with vegan butter and maple syrup or make sandwiches with it.\n\nThis Pumpkin Cornbread comes together very quickly. The pumpkin and the spices add a wonderful flavor and moistness to it. Just a touch of maple to keep it lightly sweet. It is perfect to snack on as is, and also great made more sweeter or savory. For a sweeter version, add some sugar and add more pumpkin pie spice. Add dried fruit or other additions. For a savory cornbread, reduce the maple, add some garlic powder, nutritional yeast, herbs! \n\n******MORE BREADS AND ROLLS FROM THE BLOG******\n\nPUMPKIN BISCUITS WITH SAGE & THYME: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-pumpkin-sage-biscuits/\n\nVEGAN GLUTEN FREE DINNER ROLLS WITH GARLIC & BASIL: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-gluten-free-dinner-rolls-garlic-basil/\n\nJALAPENO PEPPER JACK GLUTEN-FREE BISCUITS: https://www.veganricha.com/gluten-free-jalapeno-pepper-jack/\n\nCOOKBOOKS BY RICHA HINGLE (VEGAN RICHA): https://www.veganricha.com/mybooks/\n\nConnect with me on Social Media:\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\n\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/veganricha\n\nPINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/veganricha\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound \n\n #pumpkincornbread #vegancornbread #homemadecornbread #veganricha #easyveganrecipes","uploadDate":"2021-01-31T20:17:04+00:00","duration":"PT1M37S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/89kZiBMnxUo/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89kZiBMnxUo","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/89kZiBMnxUo?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["4"],"prepTime":"PT5M","cookTime":"PT35M","totalTime":"PT40M","recipeIngredient":["1/2 cup pumpkin puree","2 tbsp oil ((organic safflower or coconut))","1/4 cup maple syrup","3/4 cup almond milk ( or other non dairy milk to make nut-free)","1 tsp vinegar ((apple cider or white))","1/2 cup flour ((I use unbleached all purpose))","1.5 tsp baking powder","1/4 tsp baking soda","1 tsp pumpkin pie spice ((more or less to preference))","1/3 tsp salt  ((or scant 1/2 tsp))","3/4 cup fine or medium cornmeal"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
