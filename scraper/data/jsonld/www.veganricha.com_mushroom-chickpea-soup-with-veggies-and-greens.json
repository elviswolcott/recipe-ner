Use any beans or lentils, some mushrooms and greens, veggies and some light peppery spices. Simmer and serve.\n\nThe garlic and ginger add a lot of flavor. Black pepper, white pepper, cinnamon and cumin add a deep complex profile to the warming flavorful broth. Cinnamon helps the pepper and the broth flavor profiles. Use other spices of choice. Add other veggies of choice. Add some cooked pasta for variation.  \n\n******MORE SOUP RECIPES FROM THE BLOG******\n\nVEGAN CURRIED BUTTERNUT SQUASH SOUP: https://www.veganricha.com/curried-butternut-squash-soup-vegan/\n\nCREMINI MUSHROOM RAINBOW CHARD SHALLOT SOUP: https://www.veganricha.com/cremini-mushroom-rainbow-chard-shallot/\n\nVEGAN CHIPOTLE CORN CHOWDER: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-chipotle-corn-chowder/\n\nMOROCCAN LENTIL SOUP: https://www.veganricha.com/moroccan-lentil-soup-recipe-from-the-abundance-diet/\n\nSOMERâ€™S VEGAN CREAM OF MUSHROOM SOUP: https://www.veganricha.com/somers-cream-of-mushroom-soup-vegan/\n\nConnect with me on Social Media:\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\n\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/veganricha\n\nPINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/veganricha\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound \n\n#souprecipe #vegansouprecipe #mushroomsoup #veganricha #easyveganrecipes","uploadDate":"2020-12-16T20:01:00+00:00","duration":"PT2M26S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Bzbo6qla6Ic/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bzbo6qla6Ic","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bzbo6qla6Ic?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["2"],"prepTime":"PT15M","cookTime":"PT35M","totalTime":"PT50M","recipeIngredient":["1/2 cup chopped onion","4 cloves of garlic (finely chopped)","1 cup sliced mushrooms (I used cremini)","1 to 2 tsp fresh ginger (minced)","1/2  cup chopped carrots","1/2  cup other veggies ( like bell pepper, celery, sweet potatoes)","1/2  cup cooked chickpeas","1/4 tsp cumin","1/2 tsp black pepper (use less or more)","1/4 tsp white pepper","1/4 tsp cinnamon","1/4 tsp cayenne","2 tsp soy sauce/tamari (use gluten-free soy sauce if needed or Coconut Aminos to make soy-free)","2 tsp rice vinegar","1 to 1.5 tsp sugar  (or other sweetener)","2 cups broth  (or water)","1.5 cups or more water","1 cup spinach","1/2 tsp or more salt (use less if you plan to use salted broth, or add later)","cornstarch to thicken in the end if needed"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat.
