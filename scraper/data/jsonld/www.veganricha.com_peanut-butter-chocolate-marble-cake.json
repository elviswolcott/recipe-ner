And this Peanut Butter Chocolate Marble Cake hits the spot. The cake is more a quick bread with just the right amount of sweet (mild) from coconut sugar. Soft, moist, buttery slices make a great snack, breakfast or dessert with some whipped coconut cream or ice cream! \n\nThe cake is easy and uses just 2 bowls. Mix the wet in one, dry in one. Combine to make batter. Divide the batter into 2, add cocoa to one and nut butter like peanut, almond, hazelnut (or sunbutter for Nut-free) to the other. Marble and bake!\n\nGluten-free Version here: https://www.veganricha.com/2018/02/gluten-free-cashew-or-peanut-butter-chocolate-marble-cake-vegan-gluten-free-cake.html\n\n\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ BUY MY COOKBOOK: http://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen \nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ Join the Mailing List: https://veganricha.com/mailinglist\n\nðŸ’™ SUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\nðŸ’™ JOIN THE COMMUNITY:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nðŸ’™ COOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book:\nhttp://www.veganricha.com/vrekaz\nMy Amazon Store: https://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\n#vegan #veganism #easyveganrecipes #veganrecipes #veganricha #cooking \nMusic: If I could by Joakim Karud\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFz8Bc1wDOs","uploadDate":"2018-04-30T19:20:26+00:00","duration":"PT1M49S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8x03Q6asbNU/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x03Q6asbNU","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8x03Q6asbNU?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["8"],"prepTime":"PT15M","cookTime":"PT50M","totalTime":"PT65M","recipeIngredient":["1 cup white whole wheat flour (or use whole wheat pastry flour)","1/2 cup unbleached white flour  (or all purpose flour)","1/4 tsp salt","1 tsp baking powder","1/4 tsp baking soda","1 cup non dairy milk","2/3 cup coconut sugar or other vegan sugar (use a few tbsp more for sweeter)","1 tsp vanilla extract","1/4 cup oil","1 tbsp flax seed meal","2.5 tbsp cocoa powder","3 tbsp smooth peanut butter  (or almond butter or other creamy nut or seed butter)","vegan mini chocolate chips  (or chopped walnuts)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F / 180Âºc.","name":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F / 180Âºc.","url":"https://www.veganricha.com/peanut-butter-chocolate-marble-cake/#wprm-recipe-27231-step-0-0"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"In one bowl, whisk in all the dry ingredients.","name":"In one bowl, whisk in all the dry ingredients.","url":"https://www.veganricha.com/peanut-butter-chocolate-marble-cake/#wprm-recipe-27231-step-0-1"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"In another bowl, mix the non dairy milk, sugar, vanilla, oil and flax and mix until sugar is fully dissolved.","name":"In another bowl, mix the non dairy milk, sugar, vanilla, oil and flax and mix until sugar is fully dissolved.","url":"https://www.veganricha.com/peanut-butter-chocolate-marble-cake/#wprm-recipe-27231-step-0-2"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Add dry to wet and mix until just about combined.","name":"Add dry to wet and mix until just about combined.","url":"https://www.veganricha.com/peanut-butter-chocolate-marble-cake/#wprm-recipe-27231-step-0-3"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Transfer half of the batter into the other bowl.","name":"Transfer half of the batter into the other bowl.","url":"https://www.veganricha.com/peanut-butter-chocolate-marble-cake/#wprm-recipe-27231-step-0-4"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Sprinkle cocoa powder to one bowl and mix until just combined.
