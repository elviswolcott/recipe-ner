Instant Pot or Saucepan.\nðŸ’™ FULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2018/10/vegan-mushroom-bourguignon-instant-pot.html\nðŸ’™ MY BOOKS: https://veganricha.com/mybooks\n\nInstant Pot Mushroom Bourguignon with Potato Cauliflower Mash. All Cooked in an Instant Pot together with PIP (pot in pot). This is how one should be introduced to mushrooms(so smooth, so delicious!). \n\nThis Vegan Bourguignon uses mushrooms and veggies, loads of flavor addition, and 1 Pot. I also steam the potato and cauliflower while the mushrooms cook, Pot in Pot Cooking. It saves time and pots. Mash the steamed veggies, add herbs of choice, some non dairy milk for creamyness and serve. You can cook the potatoes/cauliflower separately if you like and also make this on the stove top. See recipe notes for Stovetop instructions and times. Lets get cooking!\nVegan Gluten-free Nut-free Recipe, can be Soy-free Oilfree.\n\nMore Holiday Recipes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Raw27tjni5o&list=PL_i8BdL_yG6s9pQAdLf8SoUx3ZSl7yRYQ\n\n\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ BUY MY COOKBOOK: http://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen \nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ Join the Mailing List: https://veganricha.com/mailinglist\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ SUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\nâœ¦ JOIN THE COMMUNITY:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nâœ¦ COOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book:\nhttp://www.veganricha.com/vrekaz\nMy Amazon Store: https://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\n\n#veganricha #easyveganrecipes #vegan #veganism #veganrecipes #cooking \nMusic: Rainy Days by Joakim Karud","uploadDate":"2018-11-08T21:26:05+00:00","duration":"PT1M28S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pggG7TLB8ws/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggG7TLB8ws","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pggG7TLB8ws?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["3"],"prepTime":"PT10M","cookTime":"PT20M","totalTime":"PT30M","recipeIngredient":["2 tsp oil","1/2  medium onion (chopped)","4 cloves of garlic (finely chopped)","10 oz sliced mushrooms (mixed or white or cremini)","1/4 cup brandy or whiskey or red wine or use broth","3/4 cup chopped carrots","1 cup chopped celery","3/4 tsp dried thyme or 1 tbsp fresh","1/4 tsp garlic powder","1 tbsp soy sauce (,tamari for gluten-free, coconut aminos for soyfree)","2 tsp tomato paste","1/2 cup water or broth","1 tbsp cornstarch or arrowroot starch mixed in 3 tbsp water ((you can also add 2 tbsp of the mashed potato mixture to thicken))","1 cup of spinach or greens","1  large potato cubed small","1 cup cauliflower florets ((heaping cup))","1 tbsp olive oil","2 to 4 tbsp non dairy milk","1/4 tsp each salt (garlic powder)","black pepper to taste"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Heat the Instant Pot on Saute.
