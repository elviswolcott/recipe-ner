Before you start, take the vegan butter out from the refrigerator  to let it come to room temperature. Start making the filling by toasting black sesame seeds in a pan on medium-low heat. Once they smell fragrant and begin to create popping sounds (this usually takes about 5-7 minutes), remove from the heat and set aside to cool. Once cooled, add sesame seeds along with sugar to a food processor and blend until grainy. Place the mixture into a bowl, and stir in vegan butter to form a paste. Note: the consistency of the paste at this point will resemble what it looks like when the tang yuan is cooked. If the filling is not runny enough, add 1/2 - 1 tablespoon of water to loosen it. Place filling in a ziplock bag, then into the freezer to let cool (or the fridge if you are not making the dough immediately).","text":"Make the Filling.

While the filling is cooling, make the dough. Place glutinous rice flour into a mixing bowl. Slowly add the warm water while stirring, then gather with your hands until a rough dough forms.

At this point, check the filling to see if it has set. The filling should have hardened but still workable. Use a knife to cut open the ziplock bag and carefully remove the block of filling, then cut into about 16 evenly-sized portions (8-10 grams each). Roll each portion into balls, then place them all back into the refrigerator to keep cool. Note: I usually take 2-3 out at a time while forming the Tang Yuan.","text":"Finish Prepping the Filling.
