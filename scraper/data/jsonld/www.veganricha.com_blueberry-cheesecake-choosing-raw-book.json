Raw cheesecake happens to be one of the most authentic tasting raw desserts, thanks to the magical combination of cashews and coconut oil. The cheesecake is easier to prepare in a high-speed blender than a food processor, but the processor can work if that’s what you have. Just be sure to soak your cashews overnight! If you don’t have cashews, macadamia nuts are a perfect substitute.","datePublished":"2014-07-03T15:00:00+00:00","image":["https://www.veganricha.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/reviews-2434.jpg","https://www.veganricha.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/reviews-2434-500x500.jpg","https://www.veganricha.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/reviews-2434-500x375.jpg","https://www.veganricha.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/reviews-2434-480x270.jpg"],"recipeYield":["12"],"prepTime":"PT15M","cookTime":"PT15M","totalTime":"PT30M","recipeIngredient":["1 1/2 cups almonds","Pinch sea salt","2 cups pitted Medjool dates","3 cups cashews (soaked in water overnight and drained)","1/4 tsp  sea salt","2/3 cup  melted coconut oil","Seeds of 1 vanilla bean (or 2 teaspoons vanilla extract)","1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice","1/2 cup agave nectar","2 cups blueberries","2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice","2 tablespoons agave nectar or pure maple syrup"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Place the almonds and sea salt in a food processor and grind roughly.
