In a bowl, combine flour and sweet potato starch (the ratio is 1 cup : 1 tablespoon if you need more) and mix well.

Before you start frying, prepare a tray lined with a wire rack. In a medium-sized pot or wok, heat up some vegetable oil (the oil level should be high enough to cover 2/3 of the cauliflower florets). Check if the oil is hot enough (*see notes for a tip). Once the oil is hot enough, fry the cauliflower until they are golden-brown, and continue stirring to make sure they don’t stick together. Note: Be sure not to over-crowd the pot/wok! Fry the cauliflower in batches. Remember to take out the little batter crumbles in the oil between each batch — if you don’t do so the cauliflower will burn more easily. Once all the cauliflower are fried to a golden-brown, remove them from the oil and onto the wire rack to drain. Immediately sprinkle them with your seasoning salt.","text":"Fry the Cauliflower.

Now, take your basil leaves (make sure the oil is not too hot and that the basil leaves are dry) and prepare a lid big enough to cover the whole pot. Drop the basil leaves, and immediately cover the pot with the lid — the leaves have some water content which will cause splashing when hit with hot oil. Count for 5 seconds and you can remove the lid, then take out the basil leaves. Drain together on the wire rack with the fried cauliflower.","text":"Fry the Basil.
