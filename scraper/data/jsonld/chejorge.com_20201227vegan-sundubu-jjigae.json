Start by heating a small pot or dolsot ttukbaegi (stone pot) with vegetable oil and toasted sesame oil over medium-high heat. Note: if using a stone pot, it will take slightly longer to heat up. Once the pot is hot, add gochugaru (Korean red pepper flakes) and toast them until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes. Add the garlic, yellow onion, scallions, and stir fry until onions become slightly softened & translucent. Add vegan kimchi and fry together for about 1 minute. Follow that with light soy sauce, base broth, and lastly the extra-soft silken tofu. Use a spatula to break up tofu into into chunks. Bring the stew to a boil and cook everything together for 5 more minutes. Note: the amount of base broth you add determines the consistency of the stew. If you prefer to have a thicker consistency, add less base broth. The rice flour slurry in the kimchi brine also helps thicken the stew. If still not thick enough at the end of cooking, I recommend adding a slurry that contains 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and 2 tablespoons of water.","text":"Make Soft Tofu Stew.
