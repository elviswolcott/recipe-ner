Classic Super moist Banana bread with toasted nuts and coconut. No Palm oil. Vegan Recipe. 1 Bowl or 1 Blender.\n\nIts slightly different from the classic pound cake like banana bread. This version inspired by the many tips on serious eats, has shredded coconut, coconut oil, toasted nuts and lots more spice. The resulting loaf is a caremelly, bananey, nutty goodness, that you want to snack on morning and evening. \n\nThe bread is like a less sweet pound cake with amazing texture. I like to toast the walnuts and the coconut for deeper flavor. Add spices of choice. I use cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg. These Bakery style Banana bread is great as is or with a drizzle of maple. If you use very ripe bananas and add in dried fruit like dates and currants, you can omit the added sugar. \n\n******MORE BREAKFAST BAKES FROM THE BLOG******\n\nBANANA WALNUT BREAKFAST LOAF: https://www.veganricha.com/banana-walnut-breakfast-loaf-gluten/\n\n1 BOWL VEGAN PUMPKIN BREAD: https://www.veganricha.com/1-bowl-vegan-pumpkin-bread-recipe/\n\nMARBLED TURMERIC PUMPKIN CHOCOLATE BREAD: https://www.veganricha.com/marbled-turmeric-pumpkin-chocolate-bread/\n\nCOOKBOOKS BY RICHA HINGLE (VEGAN RICHA): https://www.veganricha.com/mybooks/\n\nConnect with me on Social Media:\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\n\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/veganricha\n\nPINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/veganricha\n\nMusic epidemic sound\n\n#bananabread #veganbreadrecipe #breakfastbake #veganricha #easyveganrecipes","uploadDate":"2020-09-24T22:39:13+00:00","duration":"PT1M16S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sScI4FeYpXk/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScI4FeYpXk","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sScI4FeYpXk?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["6"],"prepTime":"PT15M","cookTime":"PT55M","totalTime":"PT70M","recipeIngredient":["1¾ cup flour (I use 1 cup spelt/white whole wheat + ¾ cup unbleached white flour)","1/4 cup shredded coconut","1/4 cup oats","2¼ tsp baking powder","¼ tsp baking soda","1 1/4 tsp ground spices or spice blend of choice","¼ tsp salt","A few tablespoons of toasted walnuts or pecans (plus more for garnish)","A few tablespoons vegan chocolate chunks (dried fruit like currants, chopped dates or other additions)","1/4 cup maple syrup","1/4 cup non dairy milk","1 tsp lemon juice","2  large ripe bananas or 3 medium (1 cup if well mashed, heaping 1 cup if sliced)","3 to 4 tbsp coconut sugar or other sugar (depends on the sweetness of the bananas)","3 tbsp coconut oil melted ( or other oil or use smooth nut butter)","1 tsp vanilla extract"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Preheat the oven to 365 degrees F / 180ºc.
