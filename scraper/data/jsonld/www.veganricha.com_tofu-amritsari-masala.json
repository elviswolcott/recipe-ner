This Amritsari Sauce uses toasted cayenne, spices to make a smoky spicy creamy tomato sauce. \nFULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2019/02/tofu-amritsari-masala.html\nMY BOOKS: https://veganricha.com/books\n\nAmritsar is a town in the state of Punjab and the cuisine from this city has some twists to the usual sauces and dishes. This Amritsari sauce which is often served with chikin is a fabulous base for veggies, tofu, veggie meats, or chickpeas. The sauce is a creamy onion tomato sauce like the makhani sauce. The spicing is a bit different. Vegan Glutenfree Recipe. Can be Soyfree, Nutfree\n\nCayenne and paprika (or kashmiri chili) is roasted/fried well in the beginning(there might be sneezing!), then cumin and coriander and mixed and roasted. The temperature of the pan and oil matter here so that the spices dont burn, but do roast well. Then the onion, garlic and ginger is added and cooked to golden with the smoked spices. A Blended tomato cashew sauce is then added and simmered to make a creamy smoky spicy sauce! \n\nThis sauce can easily get pretty hot. So use less heat (cayenne, smoked paprika and sub the hot green chile with mild or bell pepper) to preference. If you fry the cayenne in hotter oil, it will also burn out some of the heat.
