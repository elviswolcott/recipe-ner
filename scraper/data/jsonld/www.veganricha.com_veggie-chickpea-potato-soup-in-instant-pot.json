Saucepan option on Post\nðŸ”—FULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2018/03/veggie-chickpea-potato-soup-in-instant-pot.html\n\nThis simple Potato Chickpea and Veggie Soup comes together very quickly, has an amazing flavor profile from thyme, oregano, fennel seeds and some pepper and cinnamon, and is hearty and pleasing. Use beans such as white beans or kidney for variation, and kale/other greens for variation. \n\nWater saute some onion and garlic, mix in the rest of the ingredients and pressure cook or cook in a saucepan. Fold in greens and done. Make it creamy or brothy as you prefer. For creamier, blend up a portion of the soup and mix in. Some Non Dairy milks tend to separate under pressure, See post for best options. Separated milk is fine to eat, it just doesnt look that good.
