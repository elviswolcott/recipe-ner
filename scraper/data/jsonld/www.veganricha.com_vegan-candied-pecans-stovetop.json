These Vegan candied pecans need just 5 ingredients, a skillet and No Oil. Toast the pecans on the skillet for a few minutes. Add the coconut sugar, salt, spice mix and maple syrup and continue to cook until dry. These pecans are crunchy, sweet, spicy and amazing! Use spice blends of choice(all are linked on the post)\n\nAdd other nuts for variation. Different nuts take different roasting time, for eg almonds would take much longer to roast. Adjust the time accordingly. The recipe is easily doubled, you can use a tbsp less sugar when doubling.\n\nMusic: epidemic Sound","uploadDate":"2019-12-19T21:55:09+00:00","duration":"PT1M1S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ukPtADGECes/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukPtADGECes","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ukPtADGECes?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["8"],"prepTime":"PT10M","cookTime":"PT15M","totalTime":"PT25M","recipeIngredient":["2 cups pecans","3 tbsp coconut sugar (, 4 tbsp for sweeter)","1 tsp gingerbread spice or pumpkin pie spice or cinnamon","1/4 tsp salt","2 tbsp maple syrup"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Heat a skillet over low-medium heat.
