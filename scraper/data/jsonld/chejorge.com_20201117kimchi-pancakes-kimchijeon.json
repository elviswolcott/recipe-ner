Heat up a generous amount of oil non-stick or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. (oil should cover the whole surface of the pan). Since this recipe makes two pancakes, start by pouring half of the batter in. Note: how many pancakes you make depends on the size of your pan. Spread the batter out evenly to a thin, round shape and fry until the edges begin to look golden-brown, about 3-4 minutes. Right before you flip the pancake, add about 1 tablespoon more oil. Carefully flip the pancake and cook until the other side becomes crispy golden-brown. Note: you can turn the heat up slightly towards the end of cooking to get the pancake even crispier. Once cooked, remove the pancake from the pan and repeat until no more batter is left. Slice diagonally into 6-8 pieces. Serve warm with the dipping sauce.","text":"Make the Pancakes.
