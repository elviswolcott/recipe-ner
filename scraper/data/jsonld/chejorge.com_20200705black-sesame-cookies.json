First, heat up a non-stick pan or wok on medium-high heat (no oil), and dry-roast the black sesame seeds, around 5 minutes. Add the roasted black sesame seeds to a food processor and blend first into a rough paste, around 1 minute. Then, add the vegetable oil one tablespoon at a time. Adjust the consistency of the black sesame paste accordingly — the more oil you add, the creamier the black sesame paste becomes. For this recipe I'd go for a creamier black sesame paste, so I added roughly 4 tablespoons of vegetable oil.","text":"Make the Black Sesame Paste (Skip if using store-bought).

Pre-heat the oven to 180 degrees C (350 F). In a bowl, combine the mashed banana, black sesame paste, baking powder, and sugar. Combine well with a whisk.

The mixture may not have much structural integrity but try your best to shape each dollop into round circles. Bake the cookies for around 18-20 minutes, or until the batter has set (but will still be very soft; they will firm up more when cooled). Remove from the oven and let cool on a wire wrack.
