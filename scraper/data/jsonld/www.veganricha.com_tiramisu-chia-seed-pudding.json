Coffee Chocolate Chia pudding layered with creamy vanilla layer topped with whipped coconut cream and cocoa powder. Glutenfree Soyfree Nutfree \nFULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2019/10/tiramisu-chia-seed-pudding.html\n\nWhen you can have Tiramisu Chia seed pudding for breakfast, then why wouldnâ€™t you!\n\nThis easy chia pudding has 3 layers. The Chocolate Coffee layer has warmed non dairy milk, vanilla, cocoa powder, some coffee, maple syrup or other sweetener, and chia seeds. The warmed milk helps the chia seed absorb the liquid evenly and quickly and the pudding thickens within 15 mins!\n\nFor the cream layer I use warmed non dairy milk, almond extract, a pinch of salt and lemon juice for the cheese flavor, maple syrup or other sweetener, and chia seeds. The almond extract adds a bit of amaretto flavor without the liquor. You can add the extract to either the chocolate layer or the cream layer. The lemon and salt add a slight cream cheese like flavor which works amazingly. You can omit them for a plain vanilla pudding layer. The third layer is some fluffy whipped coconut cream and a dusting of good cocoa! and done.\n\nYou can make this without coffee and chocolate and vanilla layer pudding. Make it into Overnight oats for less chia seed texture. Loads of options on the post!\n\n#veganricha #chiapudding #easyveganrecipes #tiramisuchiapudding #veganbreakfast\n\nINDIAN KITCHEN:  https://veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nEVERYDAY KITCHEN: https://veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen\nFollow: \nMy blog: https://veganricha.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha","uploadDate":"2019-10-30T16:00:06+00:00","duration":"PT56S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZqXQXU_MexQ/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXQXU_MexQ","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZqXQXU_MexQ?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["2"],"prepTime":"PT10M","cookTime":"PT15M","totalTime":"PT25M","recipeIngredient":["3/4 cup warm non milk (such as almond, soy, oat milk or light coconut milk)","1/2 tsp vanilla extract","2.5 tbsp cocoa powder","1 tbsp brewed coffee (or 1/4 tsp instant coffee)","2 tbsp maple syrup","3.5 tbsp chia seeds","1/2 cup warm non dairy milk (, such as almond, soy, oat or light coconut milk)","a few drops almond extract (, or vanilla extract, or both)","a good pinch of salt","3 tbsp chia seeds","1/2 tsp lemon juice","2-3 tbsp whipped coconut cream ((optional))","Topping: whipped coconut cream, (cocoa powder)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Chocolate Chia Pudding: Mix the warmed non dairy milk, vanilla, cocoa, coffee, maple syrup with a whisk.
