Free of Dairy, egg, corn, soy, gluten. Can be made corn-free with a different starch such as arrowroot or tapioca.\n\nThe filling is coconut milk and melted dark chocolate. The crust is almonds, oats, cocoa and just a little oil. Add more or less cocoa to the crust to chocolatey preference. You can make the filling with blended up silken tofu and melted chocolate as well. I like mine with coconut milk :). The filling melts in the mouth and the crust adds another punch of chocolate just when you thought the silky chocolate is all gone. Look at the slice below.. that filling and the crust!\n\n******MORE DESSERT RECIPES FROM THE BLOG******\n\nCHOCOLATE CHIP PUDDING PIE WITH CHOCOLATE GANACHE AND ALMOND DATE CRUST: https://www.veganricha.com/chocolate-chip-vanilla-pudding-pie-with/\n\nCHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE DATE CARAMEL BROWNIE BARS: https://www.veganricha.com/chocolate-chip-cookie-date-caramel/\n\nTIRAMISU CHEESECAKE BROWNIES: https://www.veganricha.com/tiramisu-cheesecake-brownies-glutenfree/\n\nCOOKBOOKS BY RICHA HINGLE (VEGAN RICHA): https://www.veganricha.com/mybooks/\n\nConnect with me on Social Media:\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\n\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/veganricha\n\nPINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/veganricha/\n\nMusic: Epidemic sound\n\n #ChocolatePie #VeganChocolateSilkPie #EasyVeganRecipes #VeganRicha","uploadDate":"2020-09-17T16:08:01+00:00","duration":"PT1M33S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZQqSrAuyrro/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQqSrAuyrro","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZQqSrAuyrro?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["8"],"prepTime":"PT20M","cookTime":"PT120M","totalTime":"PT140M","recipeIngredient":["1/2 cup oat flour (ground certified gf oats)","3/4 cup almond flour (ground almonds, grind with some oats or starch for a finer grind)","1 Tbsp cornstarch","1 Tbsp flax meal","3 Tbsp sugar","1/8 tsp fine sea salt","1/4 cup cocoa powder (1 Tbsp more for dark chocolate crust)","1 Tbsp solid coconut oil","1 Tbsp olive oil","1-2 Tbsp almond milk","15 oz can full fat coconut milk","1.5 Tbsp cornstarch","1 Tbsp cocoa powder","1/4 cup ground raw sugar","3 oz Theo 70%  (or 85% dark chocolate bar 2/3 cup or 3 oz chocolate)","3 Tbsp vegan semisweet chocolate chips","1 Tbsp coconut oil","1 tsp vanilla extract"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToSection","name":"Crust","itemListElement":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"In a bowl, add all the dry ingredients and whisk.
