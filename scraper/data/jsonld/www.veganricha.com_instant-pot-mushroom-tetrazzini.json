Creamy Comforting 1 Pot Dinner. Stove top instructions on post. \nFULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2018/09/instant-pot-mushroom-tetrazzini.html\nMy Books: https://veganricha.com/mybooks\n\nSimple Creamy Comforting Pasta dinner with pantry ingredients. Ready within minutes! The sauce is like bechamel sauce with a roux. I use cashew cream for a cheesy creamy thickness. Usually you would cook the noodles separately, cook the mushrooms, veggies or meat, then mix the lot, top with cheese and breadcrumbs and bake. Thatâ€™s a lot of dishes and time! This tetrazzini gets made in the Instant pot Pressure Cooker.\n\nSaute the mushrooms, then roast the flour for a roux, add broth and noodles and close the lid. Meanwhile, prep your garnishes and dinner is ready. I like to add toasted breadcrumb topping to the dish as the texture and flavor makes it feel like it is a baked dish that has hours put into it :). You can use any other toppings of choice,some vegan parm, vegan cheese (add when hot so it melts), fresh herbs, black pepper or pepper flakes.\n\n\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ BUY MY COOKBOOK: http://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen \nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ Join the Mailing List: https://veganricha.com/mailinglist\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ SUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\nâœ¦ JOIN THE COMMUNITY:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nâœ¦ COOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book:\nhttp://www.veganricha.com/vrekaz\nMy Amazon Store: https://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\n\n#veganricha #easyveganrecipes #vegan #veganism #veganrecipes #cooking \nMusic: by Lakey Inspired \nhttps://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired/","uploadDate":"2018-10-20T01:46:49+00:00","duration":"PT2M4S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M7S6TMMtX3A/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7S6TMMtX3A","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/M7S6TMMtX3A?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["3"],"prepTime":"PT10M","cookTime":"PT25M","totalTime":"PT25M","recipeIngredient":["2 tsp oil","8 oz mushroom","1/2  onion","2 tbsp vegan butter or olive oil","1.5 tbsp flour","1/2 tsp garlic powder","1/4 tsp onion powder","1 tsp dried parsley ( or use italian blend)","1/4Â  to 1/2 tsp black pepper","1/2 to 3/4 tsp salt ((depends on the veggie broth, use 3/4 tsp if using water))","2 1/4 cup veggie broth or water","8 oz spaghetti noodles (broken into half)","1/3 cup water","1/4 cup thick cashew cream ((blend a 1/4 cup cashews with 1/4 cup water until smooth))","1/4 cup toasted breadcrumbs ((toast in 1 tsp olive oil until golden) for garnish)","vegan parmesan  (as needed or use nutritional yeast)","1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley or basil"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Press Saute on the Instant Pot.
