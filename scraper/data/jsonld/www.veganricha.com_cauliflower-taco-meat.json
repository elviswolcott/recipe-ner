Easy 1 Pan Cauliflower Walnut Filling. No Skillet needed \nFULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2018/07/cauliflower-taco-meat.html\nMY BOOKS: https://veganricha.com/mybooks\n\nTacos need a filling that is flavorful, has texture, is easy and versatile. This Cauliflower Walnut filling fits perfectly! All the flavor, all the texture! Change up the spices and herbs for variation in flavor. \n\nPulse the walnuts and onion in a food processor, then pulse cauliflower, spices. Then spread the mixture and bake until preferred consistency. No stove top cooking needed. 1 Processor to 1 baking dish.\n\nChange up the flavors to preference. I use my own chili powder blend. Change that up with different Mexican chilies for  flavor variation. Add some bbq sauce for bbq crumble and clumpier. Use Cajun blend or Jamaican jerk blend. This taco ‚Äúmeat‚Äù is bean and lentil free. Add some spiced beans or refried beans to the tacos if you like.\nUse in tacos, wraps, burrito, nachos, salads! Vegan Glutenfree Soyfree Recipe. Can be nut-free.\n\n\nüíôüß° BUY MY COOKBOOK: http://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen \nüíôüß° Join the Mailing List: https://veganricha.com/mailinglist\nüíôüß° SUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n \n‚ú¶ ‚úß‚ú¶ ‚úß‚ú¶ ‚úß‚ú¶ ‚úß‚ú¶ ‚úß‚ú¶ ‚úß‚ú¶ ‚úß‚ú¶ ‚úß‚ú¶ ‚úß‚ú¶ ‚úß‚ú¶ ‚úß‚ú¶ ‚úß‚ú¶ ‚úß‚ú¶ ‚úß‚ú¶ ‚úß‚ú¶ ‚úß\n‚ú¶ JOIN THE COMMUNITY:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\n‚ú¶ COOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book:\nhttp://www.veganricha.com/vrekaz\nMy Amazon Store: https://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha \n‚ú¶ ‚úß‚ú¶ ‚úß‚ú¶ ‚úß‚ú¶ ‚úß‚ú¶ ‚úß‚ú¶ ‚úß‚ú¶ ‚úß‚ú¶ ‚úß‚ú¶ ‚úß‚ú¶ ‚úß‚ú¶ ‚úß‚ú¶ ‚úß‚ú¶ ‚úß‚ú¶ ‚úß‚ú¶ ‚úß‚ú¶ ‚úß\n\n#veganricha #easyveganrecipes #vegan #veganism #veganrecipes #cooking \nMusic: Show Love by Joakim Karud\nhttps://soundcloud.com/joakimkarud","uploadDate":"2018-10-28T19:01:17+00:00","duration":"PT1M48S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q4qmgJOZUBk/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4qmgJOZUBk","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q4qmgJOZUBk?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["4"],"prepTime":"PT15M","cookTime":"PT35M","totalTime":"PT50M","recipeIngredient":["1/2 cup raw walnuts","1/2  small onion (chopped)","1/2  jalapeno (optional)","1  small head of cauliflower (chopped into florets)","1/2   medium tomato (, or 2 tbsp salsa, or oil packed sundried tomato)","2 tbsp or more chili powder blend ((recipe that I use below))","zest of a lime","1/2 tsp salt","1  avocado","juice of 1 lime","1/4 tsp or more salt","1/4 cup cilantro","a dash of black pepper and cayenne","1.5 tsp ground cumin","1 tsp coriander","2 tsp paprika ((1 tsp sweet and 1 tsp smoked or 1.5 sweet and 1/2 tsp smoked for less heat))","1/2 tsp each of garlic powder (onion powder)","1 tsp oregano","1/2 tsp ancho chili powder","1/4 to 1/2 tsp chipotle chili powder or flakes","a good dash of ground cinnamon (, all spice/clove, black pepper, cayenne )"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Line a large baking dish with parchment.
