Vegan Glutenfree Soyfree Recipe. Can be nutfree.\nWhenever Iâ€™ve tried store bought granola, it usually ends up being a bit too sweet. So this is just the right sweet for me. You can adjust based on your preference. Add a bit more sweetener or add more dried fruit if you like. \n\nThe granola takes a few minutes to put together. It can be made oil-free and also nut-free. Use a combination of seeds instead of the pecans. \n\nMusic: by Lakey Inspired\nsoundcloud.com/lakeyinspired\n\nFollow:\nMy blog: https://veganricha.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/","uploadDate":"2019-09-17T23:25:22+00:00","duration":"PT2M","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ye_x6Vivi14/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ye_x6Vivi14","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ye_x6Vivi14?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["12"],"prepTime":"PT10M","cookTime":"PT70M","totalTime":"PT80M","recipeIngredient":["12  soft dates (, soaked in warm water for atleast a half hour)","2 tbsp maple syrup (, 4 tbsp for sweeter)","1 tbsp oil (, coconut or neutral (or omit for oilfree and 1 tbsp more maple syrup))","1/4 cup non dairy milk ( or reserved soaking water from the dates)","1 tsp vanilla extract","1/2 tsp salt","1 tsp cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice","1/3 cup shredded coconut (, divided)","1.5 cups old fashioned oats ((certified glutenfree if needed), or use puffed glutenfree grains)","1/2 cup pecans (, heaping cup, a mix of chopped and halfs)","1/4 cup pumpkin seeds (, or other seeds or nuts such as cashews)","2 tbsp flax seed meal","2 tbsp chia seeds","1/2 to 3/4 cup dried blueberries (, or chopped dates or other dried fruit)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Line a baking dish with parchment.
